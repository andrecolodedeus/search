<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether places are appointed to receive souls after death?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that places are not appointed to receive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> after death. For as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Hebdom.): "Wise men are agreed that incorporeal things are not in a place," and this agrees with the words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii, 32): "We can answer without hesitation that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not conveyed to corporeal places, except with a body, or that it is not conveyed locally." Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body is without a body, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> also says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 32). Therefore it is absurd to assign any places for the reception of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever has a definite place has more in common with that place than with any other. Now separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, like certain other <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, are indifferent to all places; for it cannot be said that they agree with certain bodies, and differ from others, since they are utterly removed from all corporeal <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. Therefore places should not be assigned for their reception.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing is assigned to separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> after death, except what conduces to their punishment or to their reward. But a corporeal place cannot conduce to their punishment or reward, since they receive nothing from bodies. Therefore definite places should not be assigned to receive them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is a corporeal place, and yet as soon as it was made it was filled with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> [Hexaem. i, ad Gn. 1:2] says. Since then <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> even as separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are incorporeal, it would seem that some place should also be assigned to receive separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>Further, this appears from <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory's</a> statement (Dial. iv) that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> after death are conveyed to various corporeal places, as in the case of Paschasius whom Germanus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, found at the baths, and of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of King Theodoric, which he asserts to have been conveyed to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Therefore after death <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have certain places for their reception.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> do not depend on a body in respect of their being, nevertheless the corporeal world is governed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by means of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> world, as asserted by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. iii, 4) and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Dial. iv, 6). Hence it is that there is a certain fittingness by way of congruity of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> to corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, in that the more noble bodies are adapted to the more noble <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>: wherefore also the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> held that the order of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> is according to the order of movables. And though after death <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have no bodies assigned to them whereof they be the forms or determinate motors, nevertheless certain corporeal places are appointed to them by way of congruity in reference to their degree of nobility (wherein they are as though in a place, after the manner in which incorporeal things can be in a place), according as they more or less approach to the first <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> (to which the highest place it fittingly assigned), namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose throne the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> proclaim <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to be (<a href="../bible/psa102.htm#verse19">Psalm 102:19</a>, <a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse1">Isaiah 66:1</a>). Wherefore we hold that those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that have a perfect share of the Godhead are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and that those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are deprived of that share are assigned to a contrary place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Incorporeal things are not in place after a manner <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and familiar to us, in which way we say that bodies are properly in place; but they are in place after a manner befitting <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, a manner that cannot be fully manifest to us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Things have something in common with or a likeness to one another in two ways. First, by sharing a same <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>: thus hot things have something in common, and incorporeal things can have nothing in common with corporeal things in this way. Secondly, by a kind of proportionateness, by reason of which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> apply the corporeal world to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> metaphorically. Thus the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> speak of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the sun, because He is the principle of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, as the sun is of corporeal life. In this way certain <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have more in common with certain places: for instance, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are spiritually enlightened, with luminous bodies, and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are plunged in darkness by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, with dark places.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receives nothing directly from corporeal places in the same way as bodies which are maintained by their respective places: yet these same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> themselves to be appointed to such places, gather <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or sorrow therefrom; and thus their place conduces to their punishment or reward.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether souls are conveyed to heaven or hell immediately after death?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are conveyed to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> immediately after death. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse10">Psalm 36:10</a>, "Yet a little while and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall not be," says that "the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are delivered at the end of life; yet after this life they will not yet be where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be when it is said to them: Come ye blessed of My Father." Now those <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore after this life the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> do not go immediately up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion cix) that "the time which lies between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> death and the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">final resurrection</a> holds the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in secret receptacles according as each one is worthy of rest or of suffering." Now these secret abodes cannot denote <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, since also after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">final resurrection</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will be there together with their bodies: so that he would have no reason to distinguish between the time before and the time after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. Therefore they will be neither in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> nor in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> until the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is greater than that of bodies. Now the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body is awarded to all at the same time, so that each one may have the greater <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the common rejoicing of all, as appears from a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse40">Hebrews 11:40</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> providing some better thing for us--that the common <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> may make each one rejoice the more." Much more, therefore, ought the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to be deferred until the end, so as to be awarded to all at the same time.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, punishment and reward, being pronounced by the sentence of the judge, should not precede the judgment. Now <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> fire and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joys</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> will be awarded to all by the sentence of Christ judging them, namely at the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat025.htm">Matthew 25</a>. Therefore no one will go up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or down to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> before the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse1">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>): "If our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, that we have . . . a house not made with hands, but reserved in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>'; cf. <a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse4">1 Peter 1:4</a>." Therefore, after the body's dissolution, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has an abode, which had been reserved for it in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians 1:23</a>): "I desire [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Having a desire'] to be dissolved and to be with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." From these words <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> argues as follows (Dial. iv, 25): "If there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, it cannot be denied that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> likewise." Now it cannot be gainsaid that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, since this is an <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a>. Therefore neither is it to be denied that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are borne to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. That also some <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> go down to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> immediately after death is evident from <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse22">Luke 16:22</a>, "And the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> died, and he was buried in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Even as in bodies there is gravity or levity whereby they are borne to their own place which is the end of their movement, so in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> there is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit whereby they reach their reward or punishment, which are the ends of their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Wherefore just as a body is conveyed at once to its place, by its gravity or levity, unless there be an obstacle, so too the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the bonds of the flesh being broken, whereby it was detained in the state of the way, receives at once its reward or punishment, unless there be an obstacle. Thus sometimes venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, though needing first of all to be cleansed, is an obstacle to the receiving of the reward; the result being that the reward is delayed. And since a place is assigned to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in keeping with their reward or punishment, as soon as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is set free from the body it is either plunged into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> or soars to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, unless it be held back by some debt, for which its flight must needs be delayed until the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is first of all cleansed. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is attested by the manifest authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">canonical Scriptures</a> and the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers; wherefore the contrary must be judged <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> as stated in Dial. iv, 25, and in De Eccl. Dogm. xlvi.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains itself: for it expounds the words, "They will not yet be where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be," etc., by saying immediately afterwards: "That is to say, they will not have the double stole which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will have at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Among the secret abodes of which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks, we must also reckon <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, where some <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are detained before the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. The reason why a distinction is drawn between the time before and the time after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is because before the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> they are there without the body whereas afterwards they are with the body, and because in certain places there are <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> now which will not be there after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is a kind of continuity among men as regards the body, because in respect thereof is verified the saying of <a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse24">Acts 17:24-26</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . hath made of one all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>": whereas He has fashioned <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> independently of one another. Consequently it is not so fitting that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should be glorified together in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as that they should be glorified together in the body. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body is not so <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> as the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; wherefore it would be more derogatory to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> if the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were delayed, than that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body be deferred: nor could this detriment to their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> be compensated on account of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of each one being increased by the common <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> proposes and solves this very difficulty (Dial. iv, 25): "If then," he says, "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> now, what will they receive in reward for their <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> on the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a>?" And he answers: "Surely it will be a gain to them at the judgment, that whereas now they enjoy only the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, afterwards they will enjoy also that of the body, so as to rejoice also in the flesh wherein they bore sorrow and torments for the Lord." The same is to be said in reference to the damned.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the souls who are in heaven or hell are able to go from thence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> are unable to go from thence. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Cura pro Mort. xiii): "If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead took any part in the affairs of the living, to say nothing of others, there is myself whom not for a single night would my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> mother fail to visit since she followed me by land and sea in order to abide with me": and from this he concludes that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed do not mingle in the affairs of the living. But they would be able to do so if they were to leave their abode. Therefore they do not go forth from their abode.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/psa026.htm#verse4">Psalm 26:4</a>): "That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life," and (<a href="../bible/job007.htm#verse9">Job 7:9</a>): "He that shall go down to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not come up." Therefore neither the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> quit their abode.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), abodes are awarded to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> after death as a reward or punishment. Now after death neither the rewards of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> nor the punishments of the damned are increased. Therefore they do not quit their abodes.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> writing against Vigilantius addresses him thus: "For thou sayest that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> have taken up their abode either in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom or in the place of refreshment, or under the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that they are unable to visit their graves when they will. Wouldst thou then lay down the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? Wouldst thou put the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in chains, imprison them until the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>, and forbid them to be with their lord, them of whom it is written: They follow the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> whithersoever He goeth? And if the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> is everywhere, therefore we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that those also who are with Him are everywhere." Therefore it is absurd to say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed do not leave their abode.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> argues as follows: "Since the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> wander throughout the whole world, and are everywhere present with wondrous speed, why should the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, after shedding their blood be imprisoned and unable to go forth?" Hence we may infer that not only the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> sometimes leave their abode, but also the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, since their damnation does not exceed that of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who wander about everywhere.

<p>Further, the same conclusion may be gathered from <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Dial. iv), where he relates many cases of the dead having appeared to the living.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two ways of understanding a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> or heaven. First, that he goes from thence simply, so that <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> be no longer his place: and in this way no one who is finally consigned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> or <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> can go from thence, as we shall state further on (71, 5, ad 5). Secondly, they may be understood to go forth for a time: and here we must distinguish what befits them according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and what according to the order of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>; for as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Cura pro Mort. xvi): "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> affairs have their limits other than have the wonders of the Divine power, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> works differ from those which are done <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>." Consequently, according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> course, the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> consigned to their respective abodes are utterly cut off from communication with the living. For according to the course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> men living in mortal bodies are not immediately united to separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, since their entire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> arises from the senses: nor would it be fitting for them to leave their abode for any purpose other than to take part in the affairs of the living. Nevertheless, according to the disposition of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> sometimes come forth from their abode and appear to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, in the book quoted above, relates of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Felix who appeared visibly to the people of Nola when they were besieged by the barbarians. It is also credible that this may occur sometimes to the damned, and that for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> instruction and intimidation they be permitted to appear to the living; or again in order to seek our suffrages, as to those who are detained in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, as evidenced by many instances related in the fourth book of the Dialogues. There is, however, this difference between the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and the damned, that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> can appear when they will to the living, but not the damned; for even as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> while living in the flesh are able by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to heal and work wonders, which can only be done <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> by the Divine power, and cannot be done by those who lack this <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, so it is not unfitting for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to be endowed with a power in virtue of their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, so that they are able to appear wondrously to the living, when they will: while others are unable to do so unless they be sometimes permitted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, as may be gathered from what he says afterwards, is speaking according to the common course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, And yet it does not follow, although the dead be able to appear to the living as they will, that they appear as often as when living in the flesh: because when they are separated from the flesh, they are either wholly conformed to the divine will, so that they may do nothing but what they see to be agreeable with the Divine disposition, or else they are so overwhelmed by their punishments that their grief for their unhappiness surpasses their desire to appear to others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The authorities quoted speak in the sense that no one comes forth from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> simply, and do not imply that one may not come forth for a time.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (1, ad 3) the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> place conduces to its punishment or reward in so far as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, through being consigned to that place, is affected either by <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or by grief. Now this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or grief at being consigned to such a place remains in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> even when it is outside that place. Thus a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who is given the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of sitting on a throne in the church incurs no dishonor when he leaves the throne, for though he sits not therein actually, the place remains assigned to him.

<p>We must also reply to the arguments in the contrary sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> is speaking of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in reference to that which they gain from their power of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and not to that which befits them as due to them by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And when he says that they are everywhere, he does not mean that they are in several places or everywhere at once, but that they can be wherever they will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> There is no parity between <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> on the one hand and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and of the damned on the other. For the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have allotted to them the office of presiding over men, to watch over them or to try them; but this cannot be said of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Nevertheless, according to the power of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, it is competent to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that they can be where they will; and this is what <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> means to say.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or of the damned are sometimes actually present where they appear, we are not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this is always so: for sometimes these apparitions occur to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whether asleep or awake by the activity of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in order to instruct or deceive the living. Thus sometimes even the living appear to others and tell them many things in their sleep; and yet it is clear that they are not present, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> proves from many instances (De Cura pro Mort. xi, xii).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the limbo of hell is the same as Abraham's bosom?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is not the same as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom. For according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xxxiii): "I have not yet found <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> mentioning <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> in a favorable sense." Now <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom is taken in a favorable sense, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> goes on to say (Gen. ad lit. xxxiii): "Surely no one would be allowed to give an unfavorable signification to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom and the place of rest whither the godly poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was carried by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom is not the same as the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those who are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> see not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen by those who are in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom, as may be gathered from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Confess. ix, 3) who, speaking of Nebridius, says: "Whatever that be, which is signified by thut bosom, there lives my Nebridius," and further on: "Now lays he not his ear to my mouth, but his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> mouth unto Thy fountain, and drinketh as much as he can receive wisdom in proportion to his thirst, endlessly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom is not the same as the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> not that a man be taken to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>: and yet she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> may carry the departed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom is not the same as <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The place whither the beggar <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> was taken is called <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom. Now he was taken to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, for as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, Moral. xx] on <a href="../bible/job030.htm#verse23">Job 30:23</a>, "Where a house is appointed for every one that liveth," says: "<a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a> was the house of all the living until the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom is the same as <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said to his sons (<a href="../bible/gen044.htm#verse38">Genesis 44:38</a>): "You will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>": wherefore <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he would be taken to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> after his death. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> likewise was taken to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> after his death; and consequently <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom would seem to be a part of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> After death men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> cannot find rest save by the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because "he that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>" (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>). Now the first example of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who was the first to sever himself from the body of unbelievers, and to receive a special sign of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: for which reason "the place of rest given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> after death is called <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (Gen. ad lit. xii). But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have not at all times had the same rest after death; because, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming they have had complete rest through enjoying the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, whereas before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming they had rest through being exempt from punishment, but their desire was not set at rest by their attaining their end. Consequently the state of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming may be considered both as regards the rest it afforded, and thus it is called <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom, and as regards its lack of rest, and thus it is called the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Accordingly, before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom were one place <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> and not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>: and consequently, nothing prevents <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom from being after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming, and from being altogether distinct from <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>, since things that are one <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> may be parted from one another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The state of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers as regards what was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in it was called <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom, but as regards its deficiencies it was called <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Accordingly, neither is <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom taken in an unfavorable sense nor <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> in a favorable sense, although in a way they are one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The place of rest of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers was called <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom before as well as after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming, but in different ways. For since before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>' rest had a lack of rest attached to it, it was called both <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom, wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was not seen there. But since after the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>' rest is complete through their seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this rest is called <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom, but not <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> by any means. It is to this bosom of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to be brought. Hence the Reply to the Third Objection is evident: and the same meaning applies to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse22">Luke 16:22</a>, "It came to pass that the beggar died," etc., which says: "<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom is the rest of the blessed poor, whose is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether limbo is the same as the hell of the damned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is the same as the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the damned. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have "bitten" [Allusion to <a href="../bible/hos013.htm#verse14">Hosea 13:14</a>] <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, but not to have swallowed it, because He took some from thence but not all. Now He would not be said to have "bitten" <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> if those whom He set free were not part of the multitude shut up in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Therefore since those whom He set free were shut up in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, the same were shut up in <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> and in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> is either the same as <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, or is a part of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the Creed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. But he did not descend save to the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers is the same as <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/job017.htm#verse16">Job 17:16</a>): "All that I have shall go down into the deepest <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'pit']." Now since Job was a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he went down to <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> is the same as the deepest <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> there is no redemption [<a href="../cathen/11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a>, Resp. vii]. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were redeemed from <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> is not the same as <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii): "I do not see how we can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the rest which <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> received was in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> went down into <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> is not the same as <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The abodes of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> after death may be distinguished in two ways; either as to their situation, or as to the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the places, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are punished or rewarded in certain places. Accordingly if we consider the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> in respect of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the places, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they are distinct, both because in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> there is sensible punishment, which was not in the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers, and because in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> there is <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, whereas the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were detained but temporally in the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers. On the other hand, if we consider them as to the situation of the place, it is probable that <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> are the same place, or that they are continuous as it were yet so that some higher part of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> be called the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers. For those who are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> receive diverse punishments according to the diversity of their guilt, so that those who are condemned are consigned to darker and deeper parts of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> according as they have been guilty of graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and consequently the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers in whom there was the least amount of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were consigned to a higher and less darksome part than all those who were condemned to punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by His descent, delivered the Fathers from <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>, He is said to have "bitten" <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and to have descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, in so far as <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> are the same as to situation.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> descended, not to the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the damned, but to the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers. The latter is called the deepest place not in reference to the places of punishment, but in comparison with other places, as including all penal places under one head. Again we may reply with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii): who says of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>: "When <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said to his sons, 'You will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>,' he seems to have feared most, lest he should be troubled with so great a sorrow as to obtain, not the rest of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men, but the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of sinners." The saying of <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> may be expounded in the same way, as being the utterance of one in fear, rather than an assertion.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the limbo of children is the same as the limbo of the Fathers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of children is the same as the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers. For punishment should correspond to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the Fathers were detained in <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> for the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as children, namely for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Therefore the place of punishment should be the same for both.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchir. xciii): "The punishment of children who die in none but <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is most lenient." But no punishment is more lenient than that of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers. Therefore the place of punishment is the same for both.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Even as temporal punishment in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> are due to actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so temporal punishment in the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the children were due to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> be not the same it would seem that neither are the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of children and the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers the same.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers and the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of children, without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, differ as to the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of punishment or reward. For children have no hope of the blessed life, as the Fathers in <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> had, in whom, moreover, shone forth the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But as regards their situation, there is reason to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the place of both is the same; except that the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers is placed higher than the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of children, just as we have stated in reference to <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> (5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Fathers did not stand in the same relation to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> as children. For in the Fathers <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> was expiated in so far as it infected the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, while there remained an obstacle on the part of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, on account of which their satisfaction was not yet complete. On the other hand, in children there is an obstacle both on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and on the part of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and for this reason different abodes are appointed to the Fathers and to children.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking of punishments due to some one by reason of his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Of these the most lenient are due to those who are burdened with none but <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. But lighter still is the punishment due to those who are debarred from the reception of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by no personal defect but only by a defect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so that this very delay of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is called a kind of punishment.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether so many abodes should be distinguished?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we should not distinguish so many abodes. For after death, just as abodes are due to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so are they due on account of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Now there is only one abode due on account of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, namely paradise. Therefore neither should there be more than one abode due on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, abodes are appointed to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> after death on account of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or demerits. Now there is one place where they <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit. Therefore only one abode should be assigned to them after death.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the places of punishment should correspond to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now there are only three kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, namely original, venial, and mortal. Therefore there should only be three penal abodes.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> On the other hand, it would seem that there should be many more than those assigned. For this darksome air is the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> house of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> (<a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse17">2 Peter 2:17</a>), and yet it is not reckoned among the five abodes which are mentioned by certain authors. Therefore there are more than five abodes.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">earthly paradise</a> is distinct from the heavenly paradise. Now some were borne away to the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">earthly paradise</a> after this state of life, as is related of Enoch and Elias. Since then the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">earthly paradise</a> is not counted among the five abodes, it would seem that there are more than five.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, some penal place should correspond to each state of sinners. Now if we suppose a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to die in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> who has committed only venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, none of the assigned abodes will be befitting to him. For it is clear that he would not be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, since he would be without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and for the same reason neither would he be in the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers; nor again, would he be in the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of children, since there is no sensible punishment there, which is due to such a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by reason of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: nor would he be in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, where there is none but temporal punishment, whereas <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a> is due to him: nor would he be in the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the damned, since he is not guilty of actual mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore a sixth abode should be assigned.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, rewards and punishments vary in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> according to the differences of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Now the degrees of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore we should distinguish an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of abodes, in which <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are punished or rewarded after death.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are sometimes punished in the places where they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states (Dial. iv, 55). But they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in the place which we inhabit. Therefore this place should be reckoned among the abodes, especially since some are punished for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in this world, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> said above (Sent. iv, D, 21).

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, just as some die in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a> and have some venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> for which they deserve punishment, so some die in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and have some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for which they would deserve a reward. Now to those who die in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> an abode is assigned where they are punished ere they receive their reward, which abode is <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. Therefore, on the other hand, there should be equally an abode for those who die in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> together with some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works.

<p><strong>Objection 10.</strong> Further, just as the Fathers were delayed from obtaining full <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming, so are they now detained from receiving the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body. Therefore as we distinguish an abode of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from the one where they are received now, so ought we to distinguish the one in which they are received now from the one where they will be received after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The abodes of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are distinguished according to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>' various states. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united to a mortal body is in the state of meriting, while the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body is in the state of receiving <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for its <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>; so that after death it is either in the state of receiving its final reward, or in the state of being hindered from receiving it. If it is in the state of receiving its final retribution, this happens in two ways: either in the respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and then it is paradise; or in respect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and thus as regards actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> it is <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and as regards <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> it is the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of children. On the other hand, if it be in the state where it is hindered from receiving its final reward, this is either on account of a defect of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and thus we have <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> where <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are detained from receiving their reward at once on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they have committed, or else it is on account of a defect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and thus we have the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers, where the Fathers were detained from obtaining <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on account of the guilt of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which could not yet be expiated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Good happens in one way, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in many ways, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv) and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 6): wherefore it is not unfitting if there be one place of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">blissful</a> reward and several places of punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The state of meriting and demeriting is one state, since the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is able to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and demerit: wherefore it is fitting that one place should be assigned to all: whereas of those who receive according to their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> there are various states, and consequently the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One may be punished in two ways for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as stated above, either in reference to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or in reference to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> only. Consequently there is a twofold <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> corresponding to that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This darksome air is assigned to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, not as the place where they receive retribution for their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, but as a place befitting their office, in so far as they are appointed to try us. Hence it is not reckoned among the abodes of which we are treating now: since <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> fire is assigned to them in the first place (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm">Matthew 25</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">earthly paradise</a> belongs to the state of the wayfarer rather than to the state of those who receive for their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>; and consequently it is not reckoned among the abodes whereof we are treating now.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> This supposition is impossible [Cf. I-II, 89, 6]. If, however, it were possible, such a one would be punished in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>: for it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that it be punished temporally in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, through its having <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> annexed to it: wherefore if it be annexed to a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it will be punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. And since this one who dies in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> has a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it is not unfitting to suppose that he be punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> Diversity of degrees in punishments or rewards does not diversify the state, and it is according to the diversity of state that we distinguish various abodes. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> Although separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are sometimes punished in the place where we dwell, it does not follow that this is their proper place of punishment: but this is done for our instruction, that seeing their punishment we may be deterred from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. That <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> while yet in the flesh are punished here for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> has nothing to do with the question, because a punishment of this kind does not place a man outside the state of meriting or demeriting: whereas we are treating now of the abodes to which <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are assigned after the state of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> It is impossible for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be pure and without the admixture of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a> is without any admixture of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Consequently those who are to be conveyed to beatitude which is a <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a> must be cleansed of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. wherefore there must needs be a place where such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are cleansed if they go hence without being perfectly clean. But those who will be thrust into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> will not be free from all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and consequently the comparison fails, since those who are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> can receive the reward of their goods, in so far as their past goods avail for the mitigation of their punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 10.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward consists in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but the body's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, since it overflows from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is entirely founded as it were on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and consequently lack of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a difference of state, whereas lack of the body's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> does not. For this reason, too, the same place, namely the empyrean, is assigned to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> separated from their bodies and united to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> bodies: whereas the same place was not assigned to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the Fathers both before and after the glorification of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.
