<h1>Question 69. The beatitudes</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2069.htm#article1"> Do the beatitudes differ from the gifts and virtues?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2069.htm#article2"> The rewards of the beatitudes: do they refer to this life?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2069.htm#article3"> The number of the beatitudes</a> <li><a href="../summa/2069.htm#article4"> The fittingness of the rewards ascribed to the beatitudes</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the beatitudes differ from the virtues and gifts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> do not differ from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4) assigns the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> recited by Matthew (v 3, seqq.) to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> in his commentary on <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse20">Luke 6:20, seqq.</a>, ascribes the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> mentioned there, to the four cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> do not differ from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there are but two rules of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will: the reason and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (19, 3; 21, 1). Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in relation to reason; while the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> perfect him in relation to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as is clear from what has been said (68, A1,3, seqq.). Therefore there cannot be anything else pertaining to the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, besides the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> do not differ from them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, among the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are included meekness, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and mercy, which are said to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> do not differ from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Certain things are included among the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>, that are neither <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> nor <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, mourning, and peace. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> differ from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (2, 7; 3, 1), <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Now one is said to possess the end already, when one hopes to possess it; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 9) that "children are said to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> because they are full of hope"; and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans 8:24</a>): "We are saved by hope." Again, we hope to obtain an end, because we are suitably moved towards that end, and approach thereto; and this implies some action. And a man is moved towards, and approaches the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> end by works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and above all by the works of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, if we speak of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, for which our reason is not sufficient, since we need to be moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and to be perfected with His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> that we may obey and follow him. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> differ from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but as act from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> assign the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as acts are ascribed to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are more excellent than the cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (Question 68, Article 8). Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, in explaining the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> propounded to the throng, assigns them to the cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, who is explaining the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> delivered to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> on the mountain, and so to those who were more perfect, ascribes them to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument proves that no other <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, besides the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, rectify <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Meekness is to be taken as denoting the act of meekness: and the same applies to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and mercy. And though these might seem to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, they are nevertheless ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in all matters wherein the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect him, as stated above (Question 68, Article 2).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the rewards assigned to the beatitudes refer to this life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the rewards assigned to the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> do not refer to this life. Because some are said to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> because they hope for a reward, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now the object of hope is future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Therefore these rewards refer to the life to come.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, certain punishments are set down in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>, <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse25">Luke 6:25</a>, where we read: "Woe to you that are filled; for you shall hunger. Woe to you that now laugh, for you shall mourn and weep." Now these punishments do not refer to this life, because frequently men are not punished in this life, according to <a href="../bible/job021.htm#verse13">Job 21:13</a>: "They spend their days in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>." Therefore neither do the rewards of the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> refer to this life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> which is set down as the reward of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix) [Cf. De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 1. Again, abundant fullness is not to be had save in the life to come, according to <a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse15">Psalm 16:15</a>: "I shall be filled [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'satisfied'] when Thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall appear." Again, it is only in the future life that we shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that our Divine sonship will be made manifest, according to <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1 John 3:2</a>: "We are now the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, when He shall appear, we shall be like to Him, because we shall see Him as He is." Therefore these rewards refer to the future life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4): "These promises can be fulfilled in this life, as we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them to have been fulfilled in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For no words can express that complete change into the likeness even of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, which is promised to us after this life."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Expounders of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> are not agreed in speaking of these rewards. For some, with <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (Super Luc. v), hold that all these rewards refer to the life to come; while <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4) holds them to refer to the present life; and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> in his homilies (In Matth. xv) says that some refer to the future, and some to the present life.

<p>In order to make the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> clear we must take note that hope of future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> may be in us for two reasons. First, by reason of our having a preparation for, or a disposition to future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; and this is by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; secondly, by a kind of imperfect inchoation of future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, even in this life. For it is one thing to hope that the tree will bear fruit, when the leaves begin to appear, and another, when we see the first signs of the fruit.

<p>Accordingly, those things which are set down as <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>, are a kind of preparation for, or disposition to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, either perfect or inchoate: while those that are assigned as rewards, may be either perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, so as to refer to the future life, or some beginning of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, such as is found in those who have attained perfection, in which case they refer to the present life. Because when a man begins to make progress in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, it is to be hoped that he will arrive at perfection, both as a wayfarer, and as a citizen of the heavenly kingdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Hope regards future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> as the last end: yet it may also regard the assistance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as that which leads to that end, according to <a href="../bible/psa027.htm#verse7">Psalm 27:7</a>: "In Him hath my heart hoped, and I have been helped."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although sometimes the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> do not undergo temporal punishment in this life, yet they suffer <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> punishment. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. i): "Thou hast decreed, and it is so, Lord--that the disordered mind should be its own punishment." The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, too, says of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> (Ethic. ix, 4) that "their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is divided against itself . . . one part pulls this way, another that"; and afterwards he concludes, saying: "If <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> makes a man so miserable, he should strain every nerve to avoid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>." In like manner, although, on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> sometimes do not receive material rewards in this life, yet they never lack <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> rewards, even in this life, according to <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse29">Matthew 19:29</a>, and <a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse30">Mark 10:30</a>: "Ye shall receive a hundred times as much" even "in this time."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All these rewards will be fully consummated in the life to come: but meanwhile they are, in a manner, begun, even in this life. Because the "<a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv; Cf. De Serm. Dom. in Monte, i, 1), can denote the beginning of perfect wisdom, in so far as "the spirit" begins to reign in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The "possession" of the land denotes the well-ordered affections of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that rests, by its desire, on the solid foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> inheritance, signified by "the land." They are "comforted" in this life, by receiving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is called the "Paraclete," i.e. the Comforter. They "have their fill," even in this life, of that food of which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse34">John 4:34</a>): "My meat is to do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sent Me." Again, in this life, men "obtain" <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> "Mercy." Again, the eye being cleansed by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding, we can, so to speak, "see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Likewise, in this life, those who are the "peacemakers" of their own movements, approach to likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are called "the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Nevertheless these things will be more perfectly fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the beatitudes are suitably enumerated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are unsuitably enumerated. For the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are assigned to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, as stated above (1, ad 1). Now some of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, viz. wisdom and understanding, belong to the contemplative life: yet no beatitude is assigned to the act of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, for all are assigned to matters connected with the active life. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are insufficiently enumerated.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, not only do the executive <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> belong to the active life, but also some of the directive <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and counsel: yet none of the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> seems to be directly connected with the acts of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or counsel. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are insufficiently indicated.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, among the executive <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> connected with the active life, fear is said to be connected with <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, while piety seems to correspond to the beatitude of mercy: yet nothing is included directly connected with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are insufficiently enumerated.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, many other <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are mentioned in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. Thus, it is written (<a href="../bible/job005.htm#verse17">Job 5:17</a>): "Blessed is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> correcteth"; and (<a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse1">Psalm 1:1</a>): "Blessed is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly"; and (<a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse13">Proverbs 3:13</a>): "Blessed is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that findeth wisdom." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are insufficiently enumerated.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> On the other hand, it seems that too many are mentioned. For there are seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: whereas eight <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are indicated.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, only four <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are indicated in <a href="../bible/luk006.htm">Luke 6</a>. Therefore the seven or eight mentioned in <a href="../bible/mat005.htm">Matthew 5</a> are too many.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> These <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are most suitably enumerated. To make this evident it must be observed that beatitude has been held to consist in one of three things: for some have ascribed it to a sensual life, some, to an active life, and some, to a contemplative life [See 3]. Now these three kinds of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> stand in different relations to future beatitude, by hoping for which we are said to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. Because sensual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, being <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is an obstacle to future beatitude; while <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the active life is a disposition of future beatitude; and contemplative <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, if perfect, is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of future beatitude, and, if imperfect, is a beginning thereof.

<p>And so <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, in the first place, indicated certain <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> as removing the obstacle of sensual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For a life of pleasure consists of two things. First, in the affluence of external goods, whether <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> or honors; from which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is withdrawn--by a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> so that he uses them in moderation--and by a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, in a more excellent way, so that he despises them altogether. Hence the first beatitude is: "Blessed are the poor in spirit," which may refer either to the contempt of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, or to the contempt of honors, which results from <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. Secondly, the sensual life consists in following the bent of one's <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, whether irascible or concupiscible. From following the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is withdrawn--by a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so that they are kept within the bounds appointed by the ruling of reason--and by a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, in a more excellent manner, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, is altogether undisturbed by them: hence the second beatitude is: "Blessed are the meek." From following the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is withdrawn--by a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> uses these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in moderation--and by <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, so that, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, he casts them aside altogether; nay more, so that, if need be, he makes a deliberate choice of sorrow [Cf. 35, 3]; hence the third beatitude is: "Blessed are they that mourn."

<p>Active life consists chiefly in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> relations with his neighbor, either by way of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> or by way of spontaneous gratuity. To the former we are disposed--by a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so that we do not refuse to do our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to our neighbor, which pertains to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>--and by a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, so that we do the same much more heartily, by accomplishing works of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> with an ardent desire, even as a hungry and thirsty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> eats and drinks with eager <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Hence the fourth beatitude is: "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." With regard to spontaneous favors we are perfected--by a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so that we give where reason dictates we should give, e.g. to our friends or others united to us; which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of liberality--and by a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, so that, through reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we consider only the needs of those on whom we bestow our gratuitous bounty: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse12">Luke 14:12-13</a>): "When thou makest a dinner or supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren," etc. . . "but . . . call the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the maimed," etc.; which, properly, is to have mercy: hence the fifth beatitude is: "Blessed are the merciful."

<p>Those things which concern the contemplative life, are either final beatitude itself, or some beginning thereof: wherefore they are included in the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, but as rewards. Yet the effects of the active life, which dispose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for the contemplative life, are included in the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>. Now the effect of the active life, as regards those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected in himself, is the cleansing of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart, so that it is not defiled by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: hence the sixth beatitude is: "Blessed are the clean of heart." But as regards the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected in relation to his neighbor, the effect of the active life is peace, according to <a href="../bible/isa032.htm#verse17">Isaiah 32:17</a>: "The work of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> shall be peace": hence the seventh beatitude is "Blessed are the peacemakers."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The acts of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> which belong to the active life are indicated in the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>: but the acts of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> pertaining to the contemplative life are indicated in the rewards, for the reason given above. Because to "see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding; and to be like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by being adoptive "children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In things pertaining to the active life, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not sought for its own sake, but for the sake of operation, as even the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ii, 2). And therefore, since beatitude implies something ultimate, the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> do not include the acts of those <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> which direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the active life, such acts, to wit, as are elicited by those <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, as, e.g. to counsel is the act of counsel, and to judge, the act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: but, on the other hand, they include those operative acts of which the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> have the direction, as, e.g. mourning in respect of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and mercy in respect of counsel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In applying the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> we may consider two things. One is likeness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. In this way all the first five <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> may be assigned to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and counsel as to their directing principles: whereas they must be distributed among the executive <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>: so that, to wit, hunger and thirst for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and mercy too, correspond to piety, which perfects <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his relations to others; meekness to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, for <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse22">Luke 6:22</a>: "It is the business of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to conquer <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and to curb indignation," <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> being about the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> and mourning to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> withdraws from the lusts and pleasures of the world.

<p>Secondly, we may consider the motives of the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>: and, in this way, some of them will have to be assigned differently. Because the principal motive for meekness is reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which belongs to piety. The chief motive for mourning is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his failings and those of worldly things, according to <a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse18">Ecclesiastes 1:18</a>: "He that addeth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, addeth also sorrow [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: labor]." The principal motive for hungering after the works of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and the chief motive for being merciful is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> counsel, according to <a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse24">Daniel 4:24</a>: "Let my counsel be acceptable to the king [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: to thee, O king]: and redeem thou thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and thy iniquities with <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> to the poor." It is thus that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> assigns them (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> All the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> mentioned in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> must be reduced to these, either as to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or as to the rewards: because they must all belong either to the active or to the contemplative life. Accordingly, when we read, "Blessed is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom the Lord correcteth," we must refer this to the beatitude of mourning: when we read, "Blessed is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly," we must refer it to cleanness of heart: and when we read, "Blessed is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that findeth wisdom," this must be referred to the reward of the seventh beatitude. The same applies to all others that can be adduced.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The eighth beatitude is a confirmation and declaration of all those that precede. Because from the very fact that a man is confirmed in <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> of spirit, meekness, and the rest, it follows that no <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> will induce him to renounce them. Hence the eighth beatitude corresponds, in a way, to all the preceding seven.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Luke relates <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> sermon as addressed to the multitude (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse17">Luke 6:17</a>). Hence he sets down the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> according to the capacity of the multitude, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no other <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> than pleasure, temporal and earthly: wherefore by these four <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> excludes four things which seem to belong to such <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. The first of these is abundance of external goods, which he sets aside by saying: "Blessed are ye poor." The second is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be well off as to his body, in food and drink, and so forth; this he excludes by saying in the second place: "Blessed are ye that hunger." The third is that it should be well with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as to joyfulness of heart, and this he puts aside by saying: "Blessed are ye that weep now." The fourth is the outward favor of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and this he excludes, saying, fourthly: "Blessed shall you be, when men shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you." And as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse20">Luke 6:20</a>, "<a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> corresponds to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which is unmoved by delights; hunger, to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since who hungers is compassionate and, through compassion gives; mourning, to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which deplores perishable things; endurance of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the rewards of the beatitudes are suitably enumerated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the rewards of the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are unsuitably enumerated. Because the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, contains all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. Therefore, once given the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, no other rewards should be mentioned.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is assigned as the reward, both of the first and of the eighth beatitude. Therefore, on the same ground it should have been assigned to all.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are arranged in the ascending order, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> remarks (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4): whereas the rewards seem to be placed in the descending order, since to "possess the land" is less than to possess "the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>." Therefore these rewards are unsuitably enumerated.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> Who propounded these rewards.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> These rewards are most suitably assigned, considering the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> in relation to the three kinds of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> indicated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). For the first three <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> concerned the withdrawal of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from those things in which sensual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists: which <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires by seeking the object of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire, not where he should seek it, viz. in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in temporal and perishable things. Wherefore the rewards of the first three <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> correspond to these things which some men seek to find in earthly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For men seek in external things, viz. <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and honors, a certain excellence and abundance, both of which are implied in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attains to excellence and abundance of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> promised the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> to the poor in spirit. Again, cruel and pitiless men seek by wrangling and fighting to destroy their enemies so as to gain security for themselves. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> promised the meek a secure and peaceful possession of the land of the living, whereby the solid reality of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> goods is denoted. Again, men seek consolation for the toils of the present life, in the lusts and pleasures of the world. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> promises comfort to those that mourn.

<p>Two other <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> belong to the works of active <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which are the works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> directing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his relations to his neighbor: from which operations some men withdraw through inordinate love of their own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> assigns to these <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> rewards in correspondence with the motives for which men recede from them. For there are some who recede from acts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and instead of rendering what is due, lay hands on what is not theirs, that they may abound in temporal goods. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> promised those who hunger after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that they shall have their fill. Some, again, recede from <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>, lest they be busied with other people's misery. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> promised the merciful that they should obtain mercy, and be delivered from all misery.

<p>The last two <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> belong to contemplative <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> or beatitude: hence the rewards are assigned in correspondence with the dispositions included in the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. For cleanness of the eye disposes one to see clearly: hence the clean of heart are promised that they shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Again, to make peace either in oneself or among others, shows a man to be a follower of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of unity and peace. Hence, as a reward, he is promised the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Divine sonship, consisting in perfect union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through consummate wisdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xv in Matth.), all these rewards are one in reality, viz. <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot grasp. Hence it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to describe it by means of various boons <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, while observing due proportion to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> to which those rewards are assigned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as the eighth beatitude is a confirmation of all the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>, so it deserves all the rewards of the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>. Hence it returns to the first, that we may understand all the other rewards to be attributed to it in consequence. Or else, according to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (Super Luc. v), the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is promised to the poor in spirit, as regards the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but to those who suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in their bodies, it is promised as regards the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The rewards are also arranged in ascending order. For it is more to possess the land of the heavenly kingdom than simply to have it: since we have many things without possessing them firmly and peacefully. Again, it is more to be comforted in the kingdom than to have and possess it, for there are many things the possession of which is accompanied by sorrow. Again, it is more to have one's fill than simply to be comforted, because fulness implies abundance of comfort. And mercy surpasses satiety, for thereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives more than he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> or was able to desire. And yet more is it to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as he is a greater <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who not only dines at court, but also sees the king's countenance. Lastly, the highest place in the royal palace belongs to the king's son.
