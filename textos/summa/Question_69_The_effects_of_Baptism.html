<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether all sins are taken away by Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that not all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, which corresponds to carnal generation. But by carnal generation <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> contracts none but <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Therefore none but <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Penance is a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the remission of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But penance is required in adults before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, according to <a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse38">Acts 2:38</a>: "Do penance and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> every one of you." Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> has nothing to do with the remission of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, various diseases demand various remedies: because as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse27">Mark 9:27-28</a>: "What is a cure for the heel is no cure for the eye." But <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, which is taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, is generically distinct from actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore not all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eze036.htm#verse25">Ezekiel 36:25</a>): "I will pour upon you clean water, and you shall be cleansed from all your filthiness."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans 6:3</a>), "all we, who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in His death." And further on he concludes (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse11">Romans 6:11</a>): "So do you also reckon that you are dead to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but alive unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>." Hence it is clear that by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> dies unto the oldness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and begins to live unto the newness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> belongs to the primitive oldness. Consequently every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse15">Romans 5:15-16</a>), the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was not so far-reaching as the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is bestowed in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: "for judgment was by one unto condemnation; but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is of many offenses, unto <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book on Infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i), that "in carnal generation, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> alone is contracted; but when we are born again of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, not only <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> but also wilful <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be forgiven save by the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>: hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse22">Hebrews 9:22</a>) that "without shedding of blood there is no remission." Consequently no movement of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will suffices for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless there be <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, and the purpose of participating in it, either by receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, or by submitting to the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore when an adult approaches <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, he does indeed receive the forgiveness of all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through his purpose of being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but more perfectly through the actual reception of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of special remedies. But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> operates by the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, which is the universal remedy for all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and so by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are loosed.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether man is freed by Baptism from all debt of punishment due to sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not freed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> from all debt of punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>): "Those things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are well ordered [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Those that are, are ordained of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>']." But guilt is not set in order save by punishment, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. cxl). Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> does not take away the debt of punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> already committed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the effect of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> has a certain likeness to the sacrament itself; since the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> "effect what they signify," as stated above (62, 1, ad 1). But the washing of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> has indeed a certain likeness with the cleansing from the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but none, seemingly, with the remission of the debt of punishment. Therefore the debt of punishment is not taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when the debt of punishment has been remitted, a man no longer deserves to be punished, and so it would be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to punish him. If, therefore, the debt of punishment be remitted by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, it would be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, to hang a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> who had committed <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> before. Consequently the severity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> legislation would be relaxed on account of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; which is undesirable. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> does not remit the debt of punishment.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse29">Romans 11:29</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and the calling of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ate without repentance," says: "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> remits all, gratis."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (49, 3, ad 2; 68, 1,4,5) by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> a man is incorporated in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse8">Romans 6:8</a>: "If we be dead with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we shall live also together with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Hence it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a> is communicated to every <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so that he is healed just as if he himself had suffered and died. Now <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, as stated above (Question 68, Article 5), is a sufficient satisfaction for all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Consequently he who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, is freed from the debt of all punishment due to him for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, just as if he himself had offered sufficient satisfaction for all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since the pains of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> are communicated to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, inasmuch as he is made a member of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, just as if he himself had borne those pains, his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are set in order by the pains of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Water not only cleanses but also refreshes. And thus by refreshing it signifies the remission of the debt of punishment, just as by cleansing it signifies the washing away of guilt.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In punishments inflicted by a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> tribunal, we have to consider not only what punishment a man deserves in respect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also to what extent he is indebted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are hurt and scandalized by another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently, although a murderer is freed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> from his debt of punishment in respect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he remains, nevertheless, in debt to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and it is right that they should be edified at his punishment, since they were scandalized at his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But the sovereign may remit the penalty to such like out of kindness.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Baptism should take away the penalties of sin that belong to this life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should take away the penalties of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that belong to this life. For as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse15">Romans 5:15</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is farther-reaching than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. But through <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>), "death entered into this world," and, consequently, all the other penalties of the present life. Much more, therefore, should <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be freed from the penalties of the present life, by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which is received in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> takes away the guilt of both original and actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it takes away the guilt of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in such a way as to free <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from all debt of punishment resulting therefrom. Therefore it also frees <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the penalties of the present life, which are a punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be removed, the effect is removed. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these penalties is <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, which is taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore such like penalties should not remain.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> on <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse6">Romans 6:6</a>, "that the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be destroyed," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "The effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is that the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is crucified, and the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> destroyed, not as though the living flesh of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were delivered by the destruction of that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> with which it has been bespattered from its birth; but that it may not hurt him, when dead, though it was in him when he was born." Therefore for the same reason neither are the other penalties taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> has the power to take away the penalties of the present life yet it does not take them away during the present life, but by its power they will be taken away from the just in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> when "this mortal hath put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse54">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>). And this is reasonable. First, because, by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and is made His member, as stated above (3; 68, 5). Consequently it is fitting that what takes place in the Head should take place also in the member incorporated. Now, from the very beginning of His conception <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was "full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," yet He had a passible body, which through His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and death was raised up to a life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> receives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but he retains a passible body, so that he may suffer for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> therein: yet at length he will be raised up to a life of impassibility. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans 8:11</a>): "He that raised up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> from the dead, shall quicken also our [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'your'] mortal bodies, because of His Spirit that dwelleth in us [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'you']": and further on in the same chapter (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse17">Romans 8:17</a>): "Heirs indeed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and joint heirs with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: yet so, if we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified with Him."

<p>Secondly, this is suitable for our <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> training: namely, in order that, by fighting against <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and other defects to which he is subject, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may receive the crown of victory. Wherefore on <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse6">Romans 6:6</a>, "that the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be destroyed," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "If a man after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> live in the flesh, he has <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> to fight against, and to conquer by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help." In sign of which it is written (<a href="../bible/jdg003.htm#verse1">Judges 3:1-2</a>): "These are the nations which the Lord left, that by them He might instruct <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> . . . that afterwards their children might learn to fight with their enemies, and to be trained up to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>."

<p>Thirdly, this was suitable, lest men might seek to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the sake of impassibility in the present life, and not for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse19">1 Corinthians 15:19</a>): "If in this life only we have hope in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we are of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> most miserable."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse6">Romans 6:6</a>, "that we may serve <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no longer--Like a man who, having captured a redoubtable enemy, slays him not forthwith, but suffers him to live for a little time in shame and suffering; so did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> first of all fetter our punishment, but at a future time He will destroy it."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on the same passage (cf. ad 1), "the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is twofold, the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and temporal punishment. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> entirely abolished the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, so that those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> repent, should not be subject to it. He did not, however, altogether abolish temporal punishment yet awhile; for hunger, thirst, and death still remain. But He overthrew its kingdom and power" in the sense that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should no longer be in fear of them: "and at length He will altogether exterminate it at the last day."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As we stated in I-II, 81, 1; I-II, 82, 1, ad 2 <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> spread in this way, that at first the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> infected the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and afterwards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> infected the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Whereas <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in reverse order at first repairs what regards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and afterwards will simultaneously repair what pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Consequently by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> He takes away from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> forthwith the guilt of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and the punishment of being deprived of the heavenly vision. But the penalties of the present life, such as death, hunger, thirst, and the like, pertain to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, from the principles of which they arise, inasmuch as it is deprived of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore these defects will not be taken away until the ultimate restoration of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> through the glorious <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether grace and virtues are bestowed on man by Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not bestowed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Because, as stated above (62, 1, ad 1), the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> "effect what they signify." But the baptismal cleansing signifies the cleansing of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from guilt, and not the fashioning of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not bestowed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one does not need to receive what one has already acquired. But some approach <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> who have already <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: thus we read (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse1">Acts 10:1-2</a>): "There was a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in Cesarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of that which is called Italian band, a religious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; who, nevertheless, was afterwards <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Peter. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not bestowed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: which is defined as a "<a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> not easily removed, by which one may act easily and pleasurably." But after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> retains proneness to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which removes <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and experiences difficulty in doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in which the act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not acquire <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse5">Titus 3:5-6</a>): "He saved us by the laver of regeneration," i.e. by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, "and renovation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Whom He hath poured forth upon us abundantly," i.e. "unto the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the fulness of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and the fulness of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are given in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the book on Infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i) "the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as His members." Now the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> flows from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the Head to all His members, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>: "Of His fulness we all have received." Hence it is clear that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the baptismal water by its cleansing signifies the washing away of guilt, and by its refreshment the remission of punishment, so by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> clearness it signifies the splendor of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (1, ad 2; 68, 2) <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> in so far as he has <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of desire, explicitly or implicitly; and yet when he actually receives <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, he receives a fuller remission, as to the remission of the entire punishment. So also before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> Cornelius and others like him receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> through their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and their desire for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, implicit or explicit: but afterwards when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, they receive a yet greater fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Hence in <a href="../bible/psa022.htm#verse2">Psalm 22:2</a>, "He hath brought me up on the water of refreshment," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "He has brought us up by an increase of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Difficulty in doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and proneness to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, not through their lacking the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but through <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> which is not taken away in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But just as <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is diminished by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, so as not to enslave us, so also are both the aforesaid defects diminished, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be not overcome by them.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether certain acts of the virtues are fittingly set down as effects of Baptism, to wit--incorporation in Christ, enlightenment, and fruitfulness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that certain acts of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are unfittingly set down as effects of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, to wit--"incorporation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, enlightenment, and fruitfulness." For <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not given to an adult, except he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; according to <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse16">Mark 16:16</a>: "He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, shall be saved." But it is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians 3:17</a>: "That <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> may dwell by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in your hearts." Therefore no one is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> except he be already incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore incorporation with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, enlightenment is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by teaching, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse8">Ephesians 3:8-9</a>: "To me the least of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, is given this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> . . . to enlighten all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>," etc. But teaching by the catechism precedes <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore it is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fruitfulness pertains to active generation. But a man is regenerated spiritually by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore fruitfulness is not an effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the book on Infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i) that "the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." And <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. ii) ascribes enlightenment to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. And on <a href="../bible/psa022.htm#verse2">Psalm 22:2</a>, "He hath brought me up on the water of refreshment," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that "the sinner's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, sterilized by drought, is made fruitful by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is born again unto the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, which is proper to the faithful of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians 2:20</a>): "And that I live now in the flesh; I live in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." Now life is only in those members that are united to the head, from which they derive sense and movement. And therefore it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as one of His members. Again, just as the members derive sense and movement from the material head, so from their <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> Head, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, do His members derive <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense consisting in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> Of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> movement which results from the instinct of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14-16</a>): "We have seen Him . . . full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and of His fulness we all have received." And it follows from this that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are enlightened by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and made fruitful by Him with the fruitfulness of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works by the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Adults who already <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are incorporated in Him <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a>. But afterwards, when they are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, they are incorporated in Him, corporally, as it were, i.e. by the visible sacrament; without the desire of which they could not have been incorporated in Him even <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The teacher enlightens outwardly and ministerially by catechizing: but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enlightens the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> inwardly, by preparing their hearts for the reception of the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse45">John 6:45</a>: "It is written in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> . . . They shall all be taught of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fruitfulness which i ascribed as an effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is that by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> brings forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works; not that by which he begets others in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>): "In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> by the Gospel I have begotten you."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether children receive grace and virtue in Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that children do not receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not possessed without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. xcviii), "depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the believer": and in like manner <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the lover. Now children have not the use of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and consequently they have neither <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore children do not receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse12">John 14:12</a>, "Greater than these shall he do," <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that in order for the ungodly to be made righteous "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worketh in him, but not without him." But a child, through not having the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, does not co-operate with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> unto its <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>: indeed at times it does its best to resist. Therefore it is not justified by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans 4:5</a>): "To him that worketh not, yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in Him that justifieth the ungodly, his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is reputed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> according to the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But a child <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not "in Him that justifieth the ungodly." Therefore a child receives neither <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> nor <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, what is done with a carnal <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> does not seem to have a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect. But sometimes children are taken to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> with a carnal <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, to wit, that their bodies may be healed. Therefore they do not receive the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect consisting in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion lii): "When little children are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, they die to that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which they contracted in birth: so that to them also may be applied the words: 'We are buried together with Him by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> unto death'": (and he continues thus) "'that as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is risen from the dead by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.'" Now newness of life is through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore children receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some of the early writers held that children do not receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, but that they receive the imprint of the character of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by the power of which they receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> when they arrive at the perfect age. But this is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, for two reasons. First, because children, like adults, are made members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; hence they must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, receive an influx of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> from the Head. Secondly, because, if this were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, children that die after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, would not come to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>; since according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is life everlasting." And consequently <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> would not have profited them unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p>Now the source of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was that they did not recognize the distinction between <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and act. And so, seeing children to be incapable of acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, they thought that they had no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> at all after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But this inability of children to act is not due to the absence of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, but to an impediment on the part of the body: thus also when a man is asleep, though he may have the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, yet is he hindered from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts through being asleep.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> depend on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will, yet so that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of these and other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> require the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which is in children; whereas acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> require an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is not in children. In this sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the book on Infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (Ep. xcviii): "The little child is made a believer, not as yet by that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the believer, but by the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself," which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book on <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> (Ep. Joan. ad Parth. iii), "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is born of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> unwillingly which is to be understood not of little children but of adults." In like manner we are to understand as applying to adults, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "without himself is not justified by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Moreover, if little children who are about to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> resist as much as they can, "this is not imputed to them, since so little do they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what they do, that they seem not to do it at all": as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a book on the Presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, addressed to Dardanus (Ep. clxxxvii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Serm. clxxvi): "Mother Church lends other feet to the little children that they may come; another heart that they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; another tongue that they may confess." So that children <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, not by their own act, but by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is applied to them: by the power of which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are bestowed on them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The carnal <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of those who take children to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> does not hurt the latter, as neither does one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> hurt another, unless he consent. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his letter to Boniface (Ep. xcviii): "Be not disturbed because some bring children to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, not in the hope that they may be born again to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but because they think it to be a remedy whereby they may preserve or recover health. For they are not deprived of regeneration, through not being brought for this <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>."

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the effect of Baptism is to open the gates of the heavenly kingdom?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, to open the gates of the heavenly kingdom. For what is already opened needs no opening. But the gates of the heavenly kingdom were opened by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rev004.htm#verse1">Apocalypse 4:1</a>): "After these things I looked and behold (a great) door was opened in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Therefore it is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, to open the gates of the heavenly kingdom.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> has had its effects ever since it was instituted. But some were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse22">John 3:22-26:</a> and if they had died then, the gates of the heavenly kingdom would not have been opened to them, since none entered therein before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mic002.htm#verse13">Micah 2:13</a>: "He went up [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'shall go up'] that shall open the way before them." Therefore it is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, to open the gates of the heavenly kingdom.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are still subject to death and the other penalties of the present life, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But entrance to the heavenly kingdom is opened to none that are subject to punishment: as is clear in regard to those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. Therefore it is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, to open the gates of the heavenly kingdom.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> on <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse21">Luke 3:21</a>, "<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> was opened," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says: "We see here the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; from which when a man comes forth, the gates of the heavenly kingdom are opened unto him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To open the gates of the heavenly kingdom is to remove the obstacle that prevents one from entering therein. Now this obstacle is guilt and the debt of punishment. But it has been shown above (1,2) that all guilt and also all debt of punishment are taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. It follows, therefore, that the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is to open the gates of the heavenly kingdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> opens the gates of the heavenly kingdom to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in so far as it incorporates them in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, by applying its power to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was not as yet consummated actually but only in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of believers, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> proportionately <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the gates to be opened, not in fact but in hope. For the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> who died then looked forward, with a sure hope, to enter the heavenly kingdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are subject to death and the penalties of the present life, not by reason of a personal debt of punishment but by reason of the state of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And therefore this is no bar to their entrance to the heavenly kingdom, when death severs the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body; since they have paid, as it were, the debt of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether Baptism has an equal effect in all?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> has not an equal effect in all. For the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is to remove guilt. But in some it takes away more <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> than in others; for in children it takes away only <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sins</a>, whereas in adults it takes away actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in some many, in others few. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> has not an equal effect in all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are bestowed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But some, after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, seem to have more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and more perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than others who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> has not an equal effect in all.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is perfected by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by form. But a form is received into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> according to its capacity. Therefore, since some of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, even children, have greater capacity for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> than others have, it seems that some receive greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than others.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> some receive not only <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, but also bodily health; thus Constantine was cleansed in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> from <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>. But all the infirm do not receive bodily health in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore it has not an equal effect in all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5</a>): "One <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." But a uniform <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> has a uniform effect. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> has an equal effect in all.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is twofold, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> effect, and the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is that for which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was instituted, namely, the begetting of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> unto <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life. Therefore, since all children are equally disposed to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, because they are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> not in their own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but in that of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they all receive an equal effect in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Whereas adults, who approach <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> in their own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, are not equally disposed to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; for some approach thereto with greater, some with less, devotion. And therefore some receive a greater, some a smaller share of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of newness; just as from the same fire, he receives more heat who approaches nearest to it, although the fire, as far as it is concerned, sends forth its heat equally to all.

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, is that to which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not ordained, but which the Divine power produces <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: thus on <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse6">Romans 6:6</a>, "that we may serve <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no longer," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "this is not bestowed in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, save by an ineffable <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is in our members, be absolutely destroyed." And such like effects are not equally received by all the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, even if they approach with equal devotion: but they are bestowed according to the ordering of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The least baptismal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> suffices to blot out all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Wherefore that in some more <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are loosed than in others is not due to the greater efficacy of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the recipient: for in each one it looses whatever it finds.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That greater or lesser <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> appears in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, may occur in two ways. First, because one receives greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> than another, on account of his greater devotion, as stated above. Secondly, because, though they receive equal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, they do not make an equal use of it, but one applies himself more to advance therein, while another by his negligence baffles <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The various degrees of capacity in men arise, not from a variety in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> which is renewed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (since all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, being of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, are of one form), but from the diversity of bodies. But it is otherwise with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. And therefore gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> according to their diverse capacity for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, but not on men.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Bodily health is not the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> work of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether insincerity hinders the effect of Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that insincerity does not hinder the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians 3:27</a>): "As many of you as have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, have put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But all that receive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore they all put on Christ: and this is to receive the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Consequently insincerity does not hinder the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the Divine power which can change <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will to that which is better, works in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But the effect of the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> cannot be hindered by that which can be removed by that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore insincerity cannot hinder the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in opposition. But many other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are more grievous than insincerity, which are not said to hinder the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore neither does insincerity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse5">Wisdom 1:5</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of discipline will flee from the deceitful." But the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore insincerity hinders the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not compel <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be righteous." Consequently in order that a man be justified by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, his will must needs embrace both <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and the baptismal effect. Now, a man is said to be insincere by reason of his will being in contradiction with either <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> or its effect. For, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Bapt. cont. Donat. vii), a man is said to be insincere, in four ways: first, because he does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>; secondly, through scorning the sacrament itself; thirdly, through observing a rite which differs from that prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in conferring the sacrament; fourthly, through approaching the sacrament without devotion. Wherefore it is manifest that insincerity hinders the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "To be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," may be taken in two ways. First, "in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," i.e. "in conformity with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." And thus whoever is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> so as to be conformed to Him by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>, puts on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Secondly, a man is said to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in so far as he receives Christ's sacrament. And thus all put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, through being configured to Him by the character, but not through being conformed to Him by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> changes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not approach with insincerity.

Nor is this the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, that an insincere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be made sincere; but that he who comes in sincerity, be justified.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be insincere who makes a show of willing what he wills not. Now whoever approaches <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, by that very fact makes a show of having right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of veneration for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and of wishing to conform to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to renounce <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently, to whatever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> a man wishes to cleave, if he approach <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, he approaches insincerely, which is the same as to approach without devotion. But this must be understood of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: but not of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently, here insincerity includes, in a way, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether Baptism produces its effect when the insincerity ceases?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> does not produce its effect, when the insincerity ceases. For a dead work, which is void of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, can never come to life. But he who approaches <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> insincerely, receives the sacrament without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore it can never come to life so as to bestow <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, insincerity seems to be stronger than <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, because it hinders its effect. But the stronger is not removed by the weaker. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of insincerity cannot be taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> which has been hindered by insincerity. And thus <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> will not receive its full effect, which is the remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it may happen that a man approach <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> insincerely, and afterwards commit a number of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And yet these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> will not be taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> washes away past, not future, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Such a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, therefore, will never have its effect, which is the remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bapt. cont. Donat. i): "Then does <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> begin to have its salutary effect, when truthful confession takes the place of that insincerity which hindered <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from being washed away, so long as the heart persisted in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 66, Article 9), <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration. Now when a thing is generated, it receives together with the form, the form's effect, unless there be an obstacle; and when this is removed, the form of the thing generated produces its effect: thus at the same time as a weighty body is generated, it has a downward movement, unless something prevent this; and when the obstacle is removed, it begins forthwith to move downwards. In like manner when a man is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, he receives the character, which is like a form; and he receives in consequence its proper effect, which is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted. But this effect is sometimes hindered by insincerity. Wherefore, when this obstacle is removed by Penance, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> forthwith produces its effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consequently, it is not dead in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who being insincere, is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Insincerity is not removed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> but by Penance: and when it is removed, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> takes away all guilt, and all debt of punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, whether committed before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, or even co-existent with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bapt. cont. Donat. i): "Yesterday is blotted out, and whatever remains over and above, even the very last hour and moment preceding <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, the very moment of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But from that moment forward he is bound by his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>." And so both <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and Penance concur in producing the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, but <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> as the direct efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, Penance as the indirect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, i.e. as removing the obstacle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is to take away not future, but present and past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And consequently, when the insincerity passes away, subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are indeed remitted, but by Penance, not by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Wherefore they are not remitted, like the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which preceded <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as to the whole debt of punishment.
