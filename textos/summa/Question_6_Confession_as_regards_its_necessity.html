<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether confession is necessary for salvation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that confession is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> is ordained for the sake of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is sufficiently remitted by the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore confession is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order to do penance for one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we read of some being forgiven their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without confession, e.g. Peter, <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalen</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that remits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is not less efficacious now than it was then. Therefore neither is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> now that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should confess.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is contracted from another, should receive its remedy from another. Therefore actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which a man has committed through his own act, must take its remedy from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself. Now Penance is ordained against such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore confession is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, confession is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a judicial sentence, in order that punishment may be inflicted in proportion to the offense. Now a man is able to inflict on himself a greater punishment than even that which might be inflicted on him by another. Therefore it seems that confession is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. i): "If you want the physician to be of assistance to you, you must make your disease <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him." But it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should take medicine for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should make his disease <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by means of confession.

<p>Further, in a civil court the judge is distinct from the accused. Therefore the sinner who is the accused ought not to be his own judge, but should be judged by another and consequently ought to confess to him.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, without whose power, neither original nor actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is remitted, produces its effect in us through the reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which derive their efficacy from it. Wherefore for the remission of both actual and <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, received either actually, or at least in desire, when a man fails to receive the sacrament actually, through an unavoidable obstacle, and not through contempt. Consequently those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which are ordained as remedies for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: and so just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is blotted out, is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, so also is the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>. And just as a man through asking to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, submits to the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to whom the dispensation of that sacrament belongs, even so, by confessing his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a man submits to a minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that, through the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> dispensed by him, he may receive the pardon of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: nor can the minister apply a fitting remedy, unless he be acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he acquires through the penitent's confession. Wherefore confession is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of a man who has fallen into a mortal actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> suffices for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but after the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been forgiven, the sinner still owes a debt of temporal punishment. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are ordained in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may receive the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and before he receives them, either actually or in his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, he does not receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. This is evident in the case of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and applies to Penance likewise. Again, the penitent expiates his temporal punishment by undergoing the shame of confession, by the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> to which he submits, and by the enjoined satisfaction which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> moderates according to the kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him in confession. Nevertheless the fact that confession is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is not due to its conducing to the satisfaction for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because this punishment to which one remains bound after the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is temporal, wherefore the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> remains open, without such punishment being expiated in this life: but it is due to its conducing to the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although we do not read that they confessed, it may be that they did; for many things were done which were not recorded in writing. Moreover <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has the power of excellence in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; so that He could bestow the reality of the sacrament without using the things which belong to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is contracted from another, viz. <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, can be remedied by an entirely extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as in the case of infants: whereas actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which a man commits of himself, cannot be expiated, without some operation on the part of the sinner. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not sufficient to expiate his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by himself, though he was sufficient to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by himself, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is finite on the part of the thing to which it turns, in which respect the sinner returns to self; while, on the part of the aversion, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> derives <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, in which respect the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> must needs begin from someone else, because "that which is last in order of generation is first in the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>" (Ethic. iii). Consequently actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also must needs take its remedy from another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Satisfaction would not suffice for the expiation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin's</a> punishment, by reason of the severity of the punishment which is enjoined in satisfaction, but it does suffice as being a part of the sacrament having the sacramental power; wherefore it ought to be imposed by the dispensers of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and consequently confession is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether confession is according to the natural law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that confession is according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and Cain were bound to none but the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, and yet they are reproached for not confessing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those precepts which are common to the Old and <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. But confession was prescribed in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, as may be gathered from <a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse26">Isaiah 43:26</a>: "Tell, if thou hast anything to justify thyself." Therefore it is according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> was subject only to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. But he confessed his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as appears from his words (<a href="../bible/job031.htm#verse33">Job 31:33</a>) "If, as a man, I have hid my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore confession is according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v.) that the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is the same in all. But confession is not in all in the same way. Therefore it is not according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. Further, confession is made to one who has the keys. But the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are not an institution of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>; neither, therefore, is confession.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are professions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, wherefore they ought to be proportionate to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> surpasses the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whose dictate is therefore surpassed by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. And since "the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is not begotten of opinion, but a product of a certain innate power," as Tully states (De Inv. Rhet. ii), consequently the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not part of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> which is above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This latter, however, is sometimes called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, in so far as whatever a thing derives from its Creator is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to it, although, properly speaking, those things are said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> which are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the principles of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But such things are above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reserves to Himself; and these are wrought either through the agency of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or in the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, or in the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of mysteries, or in the institution of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Hence confession, which is of sacramental <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, is according to Divine, but not according to <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is reproached for not confessing his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: because the confession which is made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the acknowledgment of one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. whereas here we are speaking of confession made to a man. We may also reply that in such a case confession of one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, namely when one is called upon by the judge to confess in a court of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, for then the sinner should not lie by excusing or denying his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and Cain are blamed for doing. But confession made <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> to a man in order to receive from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the forgiveness of one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is not according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> avail in the same way in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. But although there was a kind of confession in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, yet it was not after the same manner as in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, nor as in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it was sufficient to acknowledge one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> inwardly before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; while in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a man to declare his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by some external sign, as by making a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>-offering, whereby the fact of his having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> became <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; but it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for him to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what particular <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he had committed, or what were its circumstances, as in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> is speaking of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who hides his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by denying it or excusing himself when he is accused thereof, as we may gather from a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [Cf. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, Moral. xxii, 9 on the passage.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether all are bound to confession?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not all are bound to confession, for <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse9">Isaiah 3:9</a> ("They have proclaimed abroad"), "their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," etc.: "Penance is the second plank after shipwreck." But some have not suffered shipwreck after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore Penance is not befitting them, and consequently neither is confession which is a part of Penance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is to the judge that confession should be made in any court. But some have no judge over them. Therefore they are not bound to confession.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, some have none but venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now a man is not bound to confess such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore not everyone is bound to confession.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Confession is condivided with satisfaction and <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. Now all are bound to <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> and satisfaction. Therefore all are bound to confession also.

<p>Further, this appears from the Decretals (De Poenit. et Remiss. xii), where it is stated that "all of either sex are bound to confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as soon as they shall come to the age of discretion."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We are bound to confession on two counts: first, by the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, from the very fact that confession is a remedy, and in this way not all are bound to confession, but those only who fall into mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; secondly, by a precept of positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and in this way all are bound by the precept of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> laid down in the general council (Lateran IV, Can. 21) under <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, both in order that everyone may acknowledge himself to be a sinner, because "all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and need the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse23">Romans 3:23</a>); and that the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> may be approached with greater reverence; and lastly, that <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their flock, lest a wolf may hide therein.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although it is possible for a man, in this mortal life, to avoid shipwreck, i.e. mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, yet he cannot avoid venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which dispose him to shipwreck, and against which also Penance is ordained; wherefore there is still room for Penance, and consequently for confession, even in those who do not commit mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All must acknowledge <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as their judge, to Whom they must confess in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of His vicar; and although the latter may be the inferior if the penitent be a prelate, yet he is the superior, in so far as the penitent is a sinner, while the confessor is the minister of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to confess his venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, not in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but by the institution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that, when he has no other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to confess. We may also, with others, answer that the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> quoted above does not bind others than those who have mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to confess. This is evident from the fact that it orders all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to be confessed, which cannot apply to venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because no one can confess all his venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Accordingly, a man who has no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to confess, is not bound to confess his venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but it suffices for the fulfillment of the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that he present himself before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and declare himself to be unconscious of any mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and this will count for his confession.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is lawful for a man to confess a sin which he has not committed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is lawful for a man to confess a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he has not committed. For, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Regist. xii), "it is the mark of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to acknowledge a fault where there is none." Therefore it is the mark of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to accuse oneself of those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which one has not committed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> a man deems himself worse than another, who is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be a sinner, and in this he is to be praised. But it is lawful for a man to confess himself to be what he thinks he is. Therefore it is lawful to confess having committed a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than one has.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, sometimes one <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> about a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whether it be mortal or venial, in which case, seemingly, one ought to confess it as mortal. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> must sometimes confess a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he has not committed.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, satisfaction originates from confession. But a man can do satisfaction for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he has not committed. Therefore he can also confess a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he has not done.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whosoever says he has done what he did not, tells an untruth. But no one ought to tell an untruth in confession, since every untruth is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore no one should confess a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he has not committed.

<p>Further, in the public court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, no one should be accused of a crime which cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by means of proper <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>. Now the witness, in the tribunal of Penance, is the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Therefore a man ought not to accuse himself of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is not on his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The penitent should, by his confession, make his state <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to his confessor. Now he who tells the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> something other than what he has on his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, whether it be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, does not make his state <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but hides it; wherefore his confession is unavailing: and in order for it to be effective his words must agree with his thoughts, so that his words accuse him only of what is on his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To acknowledge a fault where there is none, may be understood in two ways: first, as referring to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, and then it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>; for it is a mark, not of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but of an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, to acknowledge having done what one has not done. Secondly, as referring to the circumstances of the act, and thus the saying of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, because a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> lest, in any act which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, there should be any defect on his part. thus it is written (<a href="../bible/job009.htm#verse28">Job 9:28</a>): "I feared all my works." Wherefore it is also the mark of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> that a man should accuse himself in words of this fear which he holds in his thoughts.

<p>From this may be gathered the Reply to the Second Objection, since a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, deems himself worse not as though he had committed an act generically worse, but because he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> lest in those things which he seems to do well, he may by <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more grievously.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When a man <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> whether a certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be mortal, he is bound to confess it, so long as he remains in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, because he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally by committing or omitting anything, while <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubting</a> of its being a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and thus leaving the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to chance; and, moreover, he courts danger, if he neglect to confess that which he <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> may be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He should not, however, affirm that it was a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but speak doubtfully, leaving the verdict to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, whose business it is to discern between what is <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> and what is not.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not commit a falsehood by making satisfaction for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he did not commit, as when anyone confesses a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he thinks he has not committed. And if he mentions a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that he has not committed, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that he has, he does not lie; wherefore he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, provided his confession thereof tally with his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether one is bound to confess at once?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one is bound to confess at once. For <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> says (De Sacram. ii): "The contempt of confession is inexcusable, unless there be an urgent reason for delay." But everyone is bound to avoid contempt. Therefore everyone is bound to confess as soon as possible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, everyone is bound to do more to avoid <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> disease than to avoid bodily disease. Now if a man who is sick in body were to delay sending for the physician, it would be detrimental to his health. Therefore it seems that it must needs be detrimental to a man's health if he omits to confess immediately to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> if there be one at hand.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is due always, is due at once. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> owes confession to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> always. Therefore he is bound to confess at once.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A fixed time both for confession and for receiving the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is determined by the Decretals (Cap. Omnis utriusque sexus: De Poenit. et Remiss.). Now a man does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by failing to receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> before the fixed time. Therefore he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he does not confess before that time.

<p>Further, it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to omit doing what a commandment bids us to do. If therefore a man is bound to confess at once, and omits to do so, with a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at hand, he would commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and in like manner at any other time, and so on, so that he would fall into many mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> for the delay in confessing one, which seems unreasonable.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the purpose of confessing is united to <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, a man is bound to have this purpose when he is bound to have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, viz. when he calls his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to mind, and chiefly when he is in danger of death, or when he is so circumstanced that unless his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be forgiven, he must fall into another <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for instance, if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> be bound to say Mass, and a confessor is at hand, he is bound to confess or, if there be no confessor, he is bound at least to <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> and to have the purpose of confessing.

<p>But to actual confession a man is bound in two ways. First, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, viz. when he is bound to do something which he cannot do without committing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless he go to confession first: for then he is bound to confess; for instance, if he has to receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, to which no one can approach, after committing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, without confessing first, if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> be at hand, and there be no urgent <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Hence it is that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliges</a> all to confess once a year; because she commands all to receive Holy Communion once a year, viz. at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, wherefore all must go to confession before that time.

<p>Secondly, a man is bound absolutely to go to confession; and here the same reason applies to delay of confession as to delay of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, because both are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Now a man is not bound to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> as soon as he makes up his mind to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and so he would not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally, if he were not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at once: nor is there any fixed time beyond which, if he defer <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, he would incur a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nevertheless the delay of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> may amount to a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or it may not, and this depends on the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the delay, since, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. viii, text. 15), the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not defer doing what it wills to do, except for a reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Wherefore if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the delay of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> has a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> connected with it, e.g. if a man put off being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> through contempt, or some like motive, the delay will be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but otherwise not: and the same seems to apply to confession which is not more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> than <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Moreover, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to fulfill in this life those things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, therefore, if he be in danger of death, he is bound, even absolutely, then and there to make his confession or to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For this reason too, James proclaimed at the same time the commandment about making confession and that about receiving <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse14">James 5:14-16</a>). Therefore the opinion seems probable of those who say that a man is not bound to confess at once, though it is dangerous to delay.

<p>Others, however, say that a <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to confess at once, as soon as he has a reasonable and proper opportunity. Nor does it matter that the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> fixes the time limit to an annual confession, because the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not favor delay, but forbids the neglect involved in a further delay. Wherefore by this <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who delays is excused, not from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; but from punishment in the tribunal of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; so that such a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> would not be deprived of proper burial if he were to die before that time. But this seems too severe, because affirmative precepts bind, not at once, but at a fixed time; and this, not because it is most convenient to fulfill them then (for in that case if a man were not to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of his superfluous goods, whenever he met with a man in need, he would commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>), but because the time involves urgency. Consequently, if he does not confess at the very first opportunity, it does not follow that he commits a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even though he does not await a better opportunity. unless it becomes urgent for him to confess through being in danger of death. Nor is it on account of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> that he is not bound to confess at once, but on account of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an affirmative precept, so that before the commandment was made, there was still less <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>.

<p>Others again say that secular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not bound to confess before Lent, which is the time of penance for them; but that religious are bound to confess at once, because, for them, all time is a time for penance. But this is not to the point; for religious have no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> besides those of other men, with the exception of such as they are bound to by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Hugh is speaking of those who die without this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for bodily health that the physician be sent for at once, except when there is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for being healed: and the same applies to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> disease.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The retaining of another's property against the owner's <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is contrary to a negative precept, which binds always and for always, and therefore one is always bound to make immediate restitution. It is not the same with the fulfillment of an affirmative precept, which binds always, but not for always, wherefore one is not bound to fulfill it at once.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether one can be dispensed from confession?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one can be dispensed from confessing his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to a man. For precepts of positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are subject to dispensation by the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now such is confession, as appears from what was said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore one may be dispensed from confession.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man can grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> in that which was instituted by a man. But we read of confession being instituted, not by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by a man (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse16">James 5:16</a>): "Confess your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, one to another." Now the Pope has the power of dispensation in things instituted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, as appears in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of bigamists. Therefore he can also dispense a man from confessing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Penance, whereof confession is a part, is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sacrament, even as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is. Since therefore no one can be dispensed from <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, neither can one be dispensed from confession.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are appointed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is founded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore they need to be appointed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> before exercising their ministry, just as the work of creation is presupposed to the work of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is founded on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have no power to publish new <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, or to do away with those which are already published, or to institute new <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, or to abolish those that are instituted, for this belongs to the power of excellence, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone, Who is the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Consequently, the Pope can neither dispense a man so that he may be saved without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, nor that he be saved without confession, in so far as it is obligatory in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. He can, however, dispense from confession, in so far as it is obligatory in virtue of the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; so that a man may delay confession longer than the limit prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> do not bind less than those of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>: wherefore, just as no dispensation is possible from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, so neither can there be from positive <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The precept about confession was not instituted by a man first of all, though it was promulgated by James: it was instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and although we do not read it explicitly, yet it was somewhat foreshadowed in the fact that those who were being prepared by John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, confessed their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to him, and that the Lord sent the lepers to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and though they were not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, yet the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> was foreshadowed in them.
