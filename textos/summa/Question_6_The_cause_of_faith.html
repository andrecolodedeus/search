<h1>Question 6. The cause of faith</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3006.htm#article1"> Is faith infused into man by God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3006.htm#article2"> Is lifeless faith a gift of God?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether faith is infused into man by God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not infused into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv) that "science begets <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in us, and nourishes, defends and strengthens it." Now those things which science begets in us seem to be acquired rather than infused. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not seem to be in us by Divine infusion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attains by hearing and seeing, seems to be acquired by him. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attains to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, both by seeing <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and by hearing the teachings of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse53">John 4:53</a>): "The father . . . <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was at the same hour, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and his whole house"; and (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse17">Romans 10:17</a>) it is said that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is through hearing." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attains to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by acquiring it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which depends on a man's will can be acquired by him. But "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> depends on the believer's will," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Praedest. Sanct. v). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be acquired by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse8">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>): "By <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you are saved through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that not of yourselves . . . that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> . . . for it is the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things are requisite for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. First, that the things which are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be proposed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: this is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything explicitly. The second thing requisite for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the assent of the believer to the things which are proposed to him. Accordingly, as regards the first of these, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must needs be from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because those things which are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> surpass <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, hence they do not come to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, unless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reveal them. To some, indeed, they are <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately, as those things which were revealed to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, while to some they are proposed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in sending preachers of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse15">Romans 10:15</a>: "How shall they preach, unless they be sent?"

<p>As regards the second, viz. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> assent to the things which are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we may observe a twofold <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, one of external inducement, such as seeing a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, or being persuaded by someone to embrace the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: neither of which is a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, since of those who see the same <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, or who hear the same sermon, some <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and some do not. Hence we must assert another internal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which moves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> inwardly to assent to matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>The Pelagians held that this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> was nothing else than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>: and consequently they said that the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is from ourselves, inasmuch as, to wit, it is in our power to be ready to assent to things which are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but that the consummation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who proposes to us the things we have to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, for, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by assenting to matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is raised above his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, this must needs accrue to him from some <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> principle moving him inwardly; and this is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as regards the assent which is the chief act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moving <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> inwardly by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Science begets and nourishes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by way of external persuasion afforded by science; but the chief and proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is that which moves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> inwardly to assent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument again refers to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that proposes outwardly the things that are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or persuades <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> by words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> does indeed depend on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the believer: but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will needs to be prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in order that he may be raised to things which are above his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (2, 3).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether lifeless faith is a gift of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>) that "the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are perfect." Now lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is something imperfect. Therefore it is not the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as an act is said to be deformed through lacking its due form, so too is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> called lifeless [informis] when it lacks the form due to it. Now the deformed act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (I-II, 79, 2, ad 2). Therefore neither is lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whomsoever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> heals, He heals wholly: for it is written (<a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse23">John 7:23</a>): "If a man receive <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath-day</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> may not be broken; are you <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at Me because I have healed the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath-day</a>?" Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> heals <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from unbelief. Therefore whoever receives from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is at the same time healed from all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But this is not done except by living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and consequently lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 13:2</a> says that "the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which lacks <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now this is lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Lifelessness is a privation. Now it must be noted that privation is sometimes <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, whereas sometimes it is not, but supervenes in a thing already possessed of its proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: thus privation of the due equilibrium of the humors is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sickness, while darkness is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a diaphanous body, but supervenes in it. Since, therefore, when we assign the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a thing, we intend to assign the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that thing as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in its proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it follows that what is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of privation, cannot be assigned as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the thing to which that privation belongs as being <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For we cannot assign as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a sickness, something which is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a disturbance in the humors: though we can assign as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a diaphanous body, something which is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the darkness, which is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the diaphanous body.

<p>Now the lifelessness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is said to be lifeless through lack of an extrinsic form, as stated above (Question 4, Article 4). Consequently the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is that which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> strictly so called: and this is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). It follows, therefore, that lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, though it is not simply perfect with the perfection of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is, nevertheless, perfect with a perfection that suffices for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> notion of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The deformity of an act is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the act's <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, considered as a moral act, as stated above (I, 48, 1, ad 2; I-II, 18, 5): for an act is said to be deformed through being deprived of an intrinsic form, viz. the due commensuration of the act's circumstances. Hence we cannot say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a deformed act, for He is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its deformity, though He is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the act as such.

<p>We may also reply that deformity denotes not only privation of a due form, but also a contrary disposition, wherefore deformity is compared to the act, as falsehood is to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Hence, just as the deformed act is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so neither is a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and as lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so too, acts that are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> generically, though not quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as is frequently the case in sinners, are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who receives <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is healed from unbelief, not entirely (because the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of his previous unbelief is not removed) but in part, namely, in the point of ceasing from committing such and such a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Thus it happens frequently that a man desists from one act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> him thus to desist, without desisting from another act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through the instigation of his own <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. And in this way sometimes it is granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to a man to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and yet he is not granted the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: even so the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, or the like, is given to some without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.
