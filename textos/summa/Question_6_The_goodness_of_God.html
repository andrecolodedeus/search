<h1>Question 6. The goodness of God</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1006.htm#article1"> Does goodness belong to God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1006.htm#article2"> Is God the supreme good?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1006.htm#article3"> Is He alone essentially good?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1006.htm#article4"> Are all things good by the divine goodness?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether God is good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> consists in mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order. But these do not seem to belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is immense and is not ordered to anything else. Therefore to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is what all things desire. But all things do not desire <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because all things do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him; and nothing is desired unless it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Therefore to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/lam003.htm#verse25">Lamentations 3:25</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them that hope in Him, to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that seeketh Him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> belongs pre-eminently to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For a thing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> according to its desirableness. Now everything seeks after its own perfection; and the perfection and form of an effect consist in a certain likeness to the agent, since every agent makes its like; and hence the agent itself is desirable and has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For the very thing which is desirable in it is the participation of its likeness. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first effective <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, it is manifest that the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and of desirableness belong to Him; and hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv) attributes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to the first efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, saying that, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> "as by Whom all things subsist."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To have mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and hence it belongs to Him to impose mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order on others; wherefore these three things are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All things, by desiring their own perfection, desire <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, inasmuch as the perfections of all things are so many similitudes of the divine being; as appears from what is said above (Question 4, Article 3). And so of those things which desire <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him as He is Himself, and this is proper to the rational creature; others <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> some participation of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and this belongs also to sensible <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; others have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as being directed to their ends by a higher <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether God is the supreme good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a> adds something to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; otherwise it would belong to every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But everything which is an addition to anything else is a compound thing: therefore the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a> is a compound. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely simple; as was shown above (Question 3, Article 7). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Good is what all desire," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 1). Now what all desire is nothing but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the end of all things: therefore there is no other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This appears also from what is said (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse19">Luke 18:19</a>): "None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone." But we use the word supreme in comparison with others, as e.g. supreme heat is used in comparison with all other heats. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be called the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, supreme implies comparison. But things not in the same genus are not comparable; as, sweetness is not properly greater or less than a line. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in the same genus as other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, as appears above (3, 5; 4, 3) it seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be called the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a> in relation to others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ii) that, the Trinity of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is "the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, discerned by purified minds."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a> simply, and not only as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in any genus or order of things. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was said in the preceding article, inasmuch as all desired perfections flow from Him as from the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. They do not, however, flow from Him as from a univocal agent, as shown above (Question 4, Article 2); but as from an agent which does not agree with its effects either in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or genus. Now the likeness of an effect in the univocal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is found uniformly; but in the equivocal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it is found more excellently, as, heat is in the sun more excellently than it is in fire. Therefore as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as in the first, but not the univocal, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, it must be in Him in a most excellent way; and therefore He is called the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a> does not add to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> any absolute thing, but only a relation. Now a relation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures, is not a reality in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in the creature; for it is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> only: as, what is knowable is so called with relation to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, not that it depends on <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but because <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> depends on it. Thus it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that there should be composition in the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, but only that other things are deficient in comparison with it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When we say that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is what all desire, it is not to be understood that every kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing is desired by all; but that whatever is desired has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And when it is said, "None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone," this is to be understood of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as will be explained in the next article.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Things not of the same genus are in no way comparable to each other if indeed they are in different genera. Now we say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in the same genus with other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; not that He is any other genus, but that He is outside genus, and is the principle of every genus; and thus He is compared to others by excess, and it is this kind of comparison the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a> implies.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether to be essentially good belongs to God alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that to be <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. For as "one" is convertible with "being," so is "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>"; as we said above (Question 5, Article 1). But every being is one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, as appears from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. iv); therefore every being is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is what all things desire, since being itself is desired by all, then the being of each thing is its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But everything is a being <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>; therefore every being is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everything is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by its own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Therefore if there is anything which is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is not its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, since it is a being, must be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and if it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by some other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, the same question applies to that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> also; therefore we must either proceed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, or come to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by any other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Therefore the first supposition holds good. Therefore everything is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Hebdom.), that "all things but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by participation." Therefore they are not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. For everything is called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> according to its perfection. Now perfection of a thing is threefold: first, according to the constitution of its own being; secondly, in respect of any <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> being added as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for its perfect operation; thirdly, perfection consists in the attaining to something else as the end. Thus, for instance, the first perfection of fire consists in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, which it has through its own <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form; its secondary perfection consists in heat, lightness and dryness, and the like; its third perfection is to rest in its own place. This triple perfection belongs to no creature by its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only, in Whom alone <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; in Whom there are no <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>; since whatever belongs to others <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> belongs to Him <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>; as, to be powerful, wise and the like, as appears from what is stated above (Question 3, Article 6); and He is not directed to anything else as to an end, but is Himself the last end of all things. Hence it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone has every kind of perfection by His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; therefore He Himself alone is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "One" does not include the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of perfection, but only of indivision, which belongs to everything according to its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> of simple things are undivided both <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">actually and potentially</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> of compounds are undivided only actually; and therefore everything must be one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, but not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, as was shown above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although everything is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in that it has being, yet the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a creature is not very being; and therefore it does not follow that a creature is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a creature is not its very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but something superadded; it is either its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, or some added perfection, or the order to its end. Still, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> itself thus added is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, just as it is being. But for this reason is it called being because by it something has being, not because it itself has being through something else: hence for this reason is it called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> because by it something is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and not because it itself has some other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> whereby it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether all things are good by the divine goodness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that all things are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. viii), "This and that are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; take away this and that, and see <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> itself if thou canst; and so thou shalt see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not by any other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But everything is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by its own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; therefore everything is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by that very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Hebdom.), all things are called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, accordingly as they are directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is by reason of the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; therefore all things are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> All things are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, inasmuch as they have being. But they are not called beings through the divine being, but through their own being; therefore all things are not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, but by their own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As regards relative things, we must admit extrinsic denomination; as, a thing is denominated "placed" from "place," and "measured" from "measure." But as regards absolute things opinions differ. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> held the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of separate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> (84, 4) of all things, and that individuals were denominated by them as participating in the separate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; for instance, that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> is called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to the separate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now just as he laid down separate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and horse which he called absolute <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and absolute horse, so likewise he laid down separate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of "being" and of "one," and these he called absolute being and absolute oneness; and by participation of these, everything was called "being" or "one"; and what was thus absolute being and absolute one, he said was the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>. And because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is convertible with being, as one is also; he called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/01060c.htm">absolute</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, from whom all things are called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by way of participation.

<p>Although this opinion appears to be unreasonable in affirming separate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things as subsisting of themselves--as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> argues in many ways--still, it is absolutely <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that there is first something which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> being and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which we call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as appears from what is shown above (Question 2, Article 3), and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> agrees with this. Hence from the first being, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> such, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, everything can be called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and a being, inasmuch as it participates in it by way of a certain assimilation which is far removed and defective; as appears from the above (Question 4, Article 3).

<p>Everything is therefore called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as from the first exemplary effective and final principle of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Nevertheless, everything is called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by reason of the similitude of the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> belonging to it, which is formally its own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, whereby it is denominated <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And so of all things there is one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and yet many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodnesses</a>.

<p>This is a sufficient Reply to the Objections.
