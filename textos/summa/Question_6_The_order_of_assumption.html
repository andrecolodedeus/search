<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the Son of God assumed flesh through the medium of the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume flesh through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the mode in which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and its parts, is more perfect than the mode whereby He is in all creatures. But He is in all creatures immediately by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, power and presence. Much more, therefore, is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> united to flesh without the medium of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh are united to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> in unity of hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But the body pertains immediately to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Indeed, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, since it is <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, would rather seem to be nearer the hypostasis than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is a form, since the principle of individuation, which is implied in the word "hypostasis," would seem to be <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume flesh through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, take away the medium and you separate what were joined by the medium; for example, if the superficies be removed color would leave the body, since it adheres to the body through the medium of the superficies. But though the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was separated from the body by death, yet there still remained the union of the Word to the flesh, as will be shown (50, 2,3). Hence the Word was not joined to flesh through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Volusianum cxxxvi): "The greatness of the Divine power fitted to itself a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and through it a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, so as to raise the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to something higher."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A medium is in reference to a beginning and an end. Hence as beginning and end imply order, so also does a medium. Now there is a twofold order: one, of time; the other, of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> nothing is said to be a medium in the order of time, for the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> united the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to Himself at the same time, as will appear (30, 3). An order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> between things may be taken in two ways: first, as regards rank of dignity, as we say the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are midway between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; secondly, as regards the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, as we say a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is midway between the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and the last effect. And this second order follows the first to some extent; for as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. xiii), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acts upon the more remote <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> through the less remote. Hence if we consider the rank of dignity, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is found to be midway between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and flesh; and in this way it may be said that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> united flesh to Himself, through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But even as regards the second order of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to some extent the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of flesh being united to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For the flesh would not have been assumable, except by its relation to the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, through which it becomes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh. For it was said above (Question 4, Article 1) that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was assumable before all others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We may consider a twofold order between creatures and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: the first is by reason of creatures being <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and depending on Him as on the principle of their being; and thus on account of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitude</a> of His power <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> touches each thing immediately, by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> and preserving it, and so it is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in all things by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, presence and power. But the second order is by reason of things being directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to their end; and it is here that there is a medium between the creature and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since lower creatures are directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by higher, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. v); and to this order pertains the assumption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, Who is the term of the assumption; and hence it is united to flesh through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If the hypostasis of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> were constituted simply by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it would follow that the body was nearest to it, since it is <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which is the principle of individuation; even as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, being the specific form, would be nearer the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But because the hypostasis of the Word is prior to and more exalted than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the more exalted any part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is, the nearer it is to the hypostasis of the Word. And hence the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is nearer the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> than the body is.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing prevents one thing being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the aptitude and congruity of another, and yet if it be taken away the other remains; because although a thing's becoming may depend on another, yet when it is in being it no longer depends on it, just as a friendship brought about by some other may endure when the latter has gone; or as a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is taken in marriage on account of her beauty, which makes a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> fittingness for the marriage tie, yet when her beauty passes away, the marriage tie still remains. So likewise, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was separated, the union of the Word with flesh still endured.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the Son of God assumed a soul through the medium of the spirit or mind?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through the medium of the spirit or mind. For nothing is a medium between itself and another. But the spirit is nothing else in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, as was said above (I, 77, 1, ad 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through the medium of the spirit or mind.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is the medium of the assumption is itself more assumable. But the spirit or mind is not more assumable than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; which is plain from the fact that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> spirits are not assumable, as was said above (Question 4, Article 1). Hence it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through the medium of the spirit.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which comes later is assumed by the first through the medium of what comes before. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> implies the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> comes before its power--the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through the medium of the spirit or mind.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Agone Christ. xviii): "The invisible and unchangeable Truth took a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by means of the spirit, and a body by means of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is said to have assumed flesh through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, on account of the order of dignity, and the congruity of the assumption. Now both these may be applied to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is called the spirit, if we compare it with the other parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is assumed congruously only inasmuch as it has a capacity for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being in His likeness: which is in respect of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that is called the spirit, according to <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse23">Ephesians 4:23</a>: "Be renewed in the spirit of your mind." So, too, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the highest and noblest of the parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the most like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hence <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6) that "the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is united to flesh through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the purest part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself being an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not distinct from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it is distinct from the other parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as a power; and it is in this way that it has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a medium.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fitness for assumption is wanting to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> spirits, not from any lack of dignity, but because of the irremediableness of their fall, which cannot be said of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> spirit, as is clear from what has been said above (I, 62, 8; I, 64, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, between which and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is said to be a medium, does not stand for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is common to all the powers, but for the lower powers, which are common to every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the soul was assumed before the flesh by the Son of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was assumed before the flesh by the Word. For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed flesh through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now the medium is reached before the end. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> before the body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is nobler than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse8">Psalm 96:8</a>: "Adore Him, all you His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the beginning, as was said above (I, 46, 3). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also (was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the beginning). But it was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> before it was assumed, for <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 2,3,9), that "neither the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> nor the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ever had any hypostasis save the hypostasis of the Word." Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was assumed before the flesh, which was conceived in the womb of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>): "We saw Him [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>'] full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," and it is added afterwards that "of His fulness we have all received" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>), i.e. all the faithful of all time, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> expounds it (Hom. xiii in Joan.). Now this could not have been unless the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had all fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> before all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, who were from the beginning of the world, for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not subsequent to the effect. Hence since the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from union with the Word, according to what is written in the same place: "We saw His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as it were of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," it would seem in consequence that from the beginning of the world the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv, 6): "The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> was not, as some untruthfully say, united to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and henceforth called <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, before <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> which was of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Peri Archon i, 7,8; ii, 8) maintained that all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, amongst which he placed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the beginning. But this is not fitting, if we suppose that it was first of all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, but not at once joined to the Word, since it would follow that this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> once had its proper subsistence without the Word; and thus, since it was assumed by the Word, either the union did not take place in the subsistence, or the pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> subsistence of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was corrupted. So likewise it is not fitting to suppose that this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was united to the Word from the beginning, and that it afterwards became <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> in the womb of the Virgin; for thus His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would not seem to be of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as ours, which are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at the same time that they are infused into bodies. Hence Pope Leo says (Ep. ad Julian. xxxv) that "Christ's flesh was not of a different <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to ours, nor was a different <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> infused into it in the beginning than into other men."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be the medium in the union of the flesh with the Word, in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but it does not follow from this that it was the medium in the order of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As Pope Leo says in the same Epistle, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> excels our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> "not by diversity of genus, but by sublimity of power"; for it is of the same genus as our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, yet excels even the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in "fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But the mode of creation is in harmony with the generic property of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and since it is the form of the body, it is consequently <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at the same time that it is infused into and united with the body; which does not happen to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, since they are <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> entirely free from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Of the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> receive according to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they have in Him; for it is written (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse22">Romans 3:22</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> unto all and upon all them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him." Now just as we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him as already born; so the ancients <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him as about to be born, since "having the same spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . we also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>," as it is written (<a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse13">2 Corinthians 4:13</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has the power of justifying by reason of the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans 4:5</a>: "But to him that worketh not, yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in Him that justifieth the ungodly, his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is reputed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> according to the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Hence because this purpose is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, there is nothing to hinder some from being justified by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, even before His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the flesh of Christ was assumed by the Word before being united to the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was assumed by the Word before being united to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Petrum xviii): "Most firmly hold, and nowise <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not conceived in the womb of the Virgin without the Godhead before it was assumed by the Word." But the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would seem to have been conceived before being united to the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or disposition is prior to the completive form in order of generation. Therefore the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was assumed before being united to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so is the body. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had no other principle of being than in other men, as is clear from the authority of Pope Leo, quoted above (3). Therefore it would seem that the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had no other principle of being than we have. But in us the body is begotten before the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> comes to it. Therefore it was the same in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; and thus the flesh was assumed by the Word before being united to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as is said (De Causis), the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> excels the second in bringing about the effect, and precedes it in its union with the effect. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is compared to the Word as a second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to a first. Hence the Word was united to the flesh before it was to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 2): "At the same time the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was made flesh, and flesh was united to a rational and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Therefore the union of the Word with the flesh did not precede the union with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh is assumable by the Word on account of the order which it has to the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as to its proper form. Now it has not this order before the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> comes to it, because when any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> becomes proper to any form, at the same time it receives that form; hence the alteration is terminated at the same instant in which the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form is introduced. And hence it is that the flesh ought not to have been assumed before it was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh; and this happened when the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> came to it. Therefore since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not assumed before the flesh, inasmuch as it is against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be before it is united to the body, so likewise the flesh ought not to have been assumed before the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since it is not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh before it has a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> flesh depends upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for its being; and hence, before the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, there is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, but there may be a disposition towards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh. Yet in the conception of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is an agent of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> might, disposed the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and brought it to its perfection at the same time.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The form actually gives the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in itself is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. And hence it would be against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a form to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> before the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And therefore the dissimilarity between our origin and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> origin, inasmuch as we are conceived before being animated, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh is not, is by reason of what precedes the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, viz. that we are conceived from the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not. But a difference which would be with reference to the origin of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, would bespeak a diversity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is understood to be united to the flesh before the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the common mode whereby He is in the rest of creatures by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, power, and presence. Yet I say "before," not in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for the flesh is understood as a being, which it has from the Word, before it is understood as animated, which it has from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But by the personal union we understand the flesh as united to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> before it is united to the Word, for it is from its union with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that it is capable of being united to the Word in Person; especially since a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is found only in the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the whole human nature was assumed through the medium of the parts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> through the medium of its parts. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Agone Christ. xviii) that "the invisible and unchangeable Truth assumed the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through the medium of the spirit, and the body through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and in this way the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." But the spirit, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and body are parts of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore He assumed all, through the medium of the parts.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed flesh through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than the body. But the parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since they are simpler than the body, would seem to be more like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is most simple, than the whole. Therefore He assumed the whole through the medium of the parts.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the whole results from the union of parts. But the union is taken to be the term of the assumption, and the parts are presupposed to the assumption. Therefore He assumed the whole by the parts.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 16): "In our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> we do not behold parts of parts, but such as are immediately joined, i.e. the Godhead and the manhood." Now the humanity is a whole, which is composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, as parts. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed the parts through the medium of the whole.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When anything is said to be a medium in the assumption of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, we do not signify order of time, because the assumption of the whole and the parts was simultaneous. For it has been shown (3],4) that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body were mutually united at the same time in order to constitute the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Word. But it is order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that is signified. Hence by what is prior in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that is assumed which is posterior in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now a thing is prior in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in two ways: First on the part of the agent, secondly on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; for these two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> precede the thing. On the part of the agent--that is simply first, which is first included in his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>; but that is relatively first, with which his operation begins--and this because the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is prior to the operation. On the part of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>--that is first which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> first in the transmutation of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now in the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> the order depending on the agent must be particularly considered, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Volusianum cxxxvii), "in such things the whole reason of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is the power of the doer." But it is manifest that, according to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the doer, what is complete is prior to what is incomplete, and, consequently, the whole to the parts. Hence it must be said that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> assumed the parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, through the medium of the whole; for even as He assumed the body on account of its relation to the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so likewise He assumed a body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on account of their relation to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> From these words nothing may be gathered, except that the Word, by assuming the parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, assumed the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And thus the assumption of parts is prior in the order of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, if we consider the operation, but not in order of time; whereas the assumption of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is prior if we consider the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>: and this is to be simply first, as was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is so simple that He is also most perfect; and hence the whole is more like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than the parts, inasmuch as it is more perfect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is a personal union wherein the assumption is terminated, not a union of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which springs from a conjunction of parts.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the human nature was assumed through the medium of grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> through the medium of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we are united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was most closely united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the union took place by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the body lives by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is its perfection, so does the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was fitted for the assumption by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through the medium of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 11) that the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> Word is like our spoken word. But our word is united to our speech by means of "breathing" [spiritus]. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is united to flesh by means of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and hence by means of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 12:4</a>: "Now there are diversities of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, but the same Spirit."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as was shown above (I-II, 110, 2). Now the union of the Word with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> took place in the subsistence, and not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as was shown above (Question 2, Article 6). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was not assumed by means of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> cannot be taken to be the medium of the assumption of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whether we speak of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union or of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union is the personal being that is given gratis from above to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the Person of the Word, and is the term of the assumption. Whereas the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is an effect following the union, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>: "We saw His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> . . . as it were of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>"--by which we are given to understand that because this Man (as a result of the union) is the Only-begotten of the Father, He is full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But if by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we understand the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doing or bestowing something gratis, the union took place by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not as a means, but as the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Our union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by operation, inasmuch as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and love Him; and hence this union is by <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, inasmuch as a perfect operation proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now the union of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is in personal being, which depends not on any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> perfection of the body; <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is but an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> perfection of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> cannot ordain the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to personal union, which is not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ordains the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Our word is united to our speech, by means of breathing [spiritus, not as a formal medium, but as a moving medium. For from the word conceived within, the breathing proceeds, from which the speech is formed. And similarly from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Word proceeds the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Who formed the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as will be shown (32, 1). But it does not follow from this that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is the formal medium in the aforesaid union.
