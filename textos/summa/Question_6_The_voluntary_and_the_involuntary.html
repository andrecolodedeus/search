<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is anything voluntary in human acts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is nothing <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. For that is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> "which has its principle within itself." as <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Natura Hom. xxxii.], <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 24), and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Ethic. iii, 1) declare. But the principle of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself, but outside him: since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is moved to act, by the appetible object which is outside him, and is as a "mover unmoved" (De Anima iii, 10). Therefore there is nothing <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. viii, 2) proves that in animals no new movement arises that is not preceded by a motion from without. But all <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are new, since none is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Consequently, the principle of all <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> is from without: and therefore there is nothing <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, he that acts <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, can act of himself. But this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse5">John 15:5</a>): "Without Me you can do nothing." Therefore there is nothing <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii) that "the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> is an act consisting in a rational operation." Now such are <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. Therefore there is something <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There must needs be something <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. In order to make this clear, we must take note that the principle of some acts or movements is within the agent, or that which is moved; whereas the principle of some movements or acts is outside. For when a stone is moved upwards, the principle of this movement is outside the stone: whereas when it is moved downwards, the principle of this movement is in the stone. Now of those things that are moved by an intrinsic principle, some move themselves, some not. For since every agent or thing moved, acts or is moved for an end, as stated above (Question 1, Article 2); those are perfectly moved by an intrinsic principle, whose intrinsic principle is one not only of movement but of movement for an end. Now in order for a thing to be done for an end, some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Therefore, whatever so acts or is moved by an intrinsic principle, that it has some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end, has within itself the principle of its act, so that it not only acts, but acts for an end. On the other hand, if a thing has no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end, even though it have an intrinsic principle of action or movement, nevertheless the principle of acting or being moved for an end is not in that thing, but in something else, by which the principle of its action towards an end is not in that thing, but in something else, by which the principle of its action towards an end is imprinted on it. Wherefore such like things are not said to move themselves, but to be moved by others. But those things which have a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end are said to move themselves because there is in them a principle by which they not only act but also act for an end. And consequently, since both are from an intrinsic principle, to wit, that they act and that they act for an end, the movements of such things are said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>: for the word "<a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>" implies that their movements and acts are from their own inclination. Hence it is that, according to the definitions of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> [See Objection 1, the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> is defined not only as having "a principle within" the agent, but also as implying "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> especially <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the end of his work, and moves himself, in his acts especially is the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> to be found.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not every principle is a first principle. Therefore, although it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act that its principle be within the agent, nevertheless it is not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act that this intrinsic principle be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> or moved by an extrinsic principle: because it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act that its intrinsic principle be a first principle. Yet again it must be observed that a principle of movement may happen to be first in a genus, but not first simply: thus in the genus of things subject to alteration, the first principle of alteration is a heavenly body, which is nevertheless, is not the first mover simply, but is moved locally by a higher mover. And so the intrinsic principle of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act, i.e. the cognitive and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, is the first principle in the genus of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement, although it is moved by an extrinsic principle according to other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> New movements in animals are indeed preceded by a motion from without; and this in two respects. First, in so far as by means of an extrinsic motion an animal's senses are confronted with something sensible, which, on being apprehended, moves the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Thus a lion, on seeing a stag in movement and coming towards him, begins to be moved towards the stag. Secondly, in so far as some extrinsic motion produces a physical change in an animal's body, as in the case of cold or heat; and through the body being affected by the motion of an outward body, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which is the power of a bodily organ, is also moved indirectly; thus it happens that through some alteration in the body the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is roused to the desire of something. But this is not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of voluntariness, as stated above (ad 1), for such movements <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an extrinsic principle are of another genus of movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to act, not only by proposing the appetible to the senses, or by effecting a change in his body, but also by moving the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> itself; because every movement either of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> or of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the First Mover. And just as it is not incompatible with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement be from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the First Mover, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is an instrument of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moving it: so it is not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act, that it proceed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nevertheless both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> movements have this in common, that it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> that they should proceed from a principle within the agent.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there is anything voluntary in irrational animals?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is nothing <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in irrational animals. For a thing is called "<a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>" from "voluntas" [will]. Now since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in the reason (De Anima iii, 9), it cannot be in irrational animals. Therefore neither is there anything <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according as <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be master of his actions. But irrational animals are not masters of their actions; for "they act not; rather are they acted upon," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 27). Therefore there is no such thing as a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act in irrational animals.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. 24) that "<a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acts lead to praise and blame." But neither praise nor blame is due to the acts of irrational minds. Therefore such acts are not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 2) that "both children and irrational animals participate in the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>." The same is said by <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. 24) and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxxii.].

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act that its principle be within the agent, together with some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end. Now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end is twofold; perfect and imperfect. Perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end consists in not only apprehending the thing which is the end, but also in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it under the aspect of end, and the relationship of the means to that end. And such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> belongs to none but the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end consists in mere apprehension of the end, without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it under the aspect of end, or the relationship of an act to the end. Such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end is exercised by irrational animals, through their senses and their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> estimative power.

<p>Consequently perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end leads to the perfect <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>; inasmuch as, having apprehended the end, a man can, from deliberating about the end and the means thereto, be moved, or not, to gain that end. But imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end leads to the imperfect <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>; inasmuch as the agent apprehends the end, but does not deliberate, and is moved to the end at once. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in its perfection belongs to none but the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: whereas the imperfect <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> is within the competency of even irrational animals.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the name of the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; and consequently it cannot be in things devoid of reason. But the word "<a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>" is derived from "voluntas" [will], and can be extended to those things in which there is some participation of will, by way of likeness thereto. It is thus that <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> action is attributed to irrational animals, in so far as they are moved to an end, through some kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is master of his actions, is due to his being able to deliberate about them: for since the deliberating reason is indifferently disposed to opposite things, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be inclined to either. But it is not thus that voluntariness is in irrational animals, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Praise and blame are the result of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act, wherein is the perfect <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>; such as is not to be found in irrational animals.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there can be voluntariness without any act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that voluntariness cannot be without any act. For that is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> which proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But nothing can proceed from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, except through some act, at least an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore there cannot be voluntariness without act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as one is said to wish by an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, so when the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> ceases, one is said not to wish. But not to wish implies involuntariness, which is contrary to voluntariness. Therefore there can be nothing <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> when the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> ceases.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as stated above (1,2). But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> involves an act. Therefore voluntariness cannot be without some act.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The word "<a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>" is applied to that of which we are masters. Now we are masters in respect of to act and not to act, to will and not to will. Therefore just as to act and to will are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, so also are not to act and not to will.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Voluntary is what proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now one thing proceeds from another in two ways. First, directly; in which sense something proceeds from another inasmuch as this other acts; for instance, heating from heat. Secondly, indirectly; in which sense something proceeds from another through this other not acting; thus the sinking of a ship is set down to the helmsman, from his having ceased to steer. But we must take note that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of what follows from want of action is not always the agent as not acting; but only then when the agent can and ought to act. For if the helmsman were unable to steer the ship or if the ship's helm be not entrusted to him, the sinking of the ship would not be set down to him, although it might be due to his absence from the helm.

<p>Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> by willing and acting, is able, and sometimes ought, to hinder not-willing and not-acting; this not-willing and not-acting is imputed to, as though proceeding from, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And thus it is that we can have the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> without an act; sometimes without outward act, but with an interior act; for instance, when one wills not to act; and sometimes without even an interior act, as when one does not will to act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We apply the word "<a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>" not only to that which proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> directly, as from its action; but also to that which proceeds from it indirectly as from its inaction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> "Not to wish" is said in two senses. First, as though it were one word, and the infinitive of "I-do-not-wish." Consequently just as when I say "I do not wish to read," the sense is, "I wish not to read"; so "not to wish to read" is the same as "to wish not to read," and in this sense "not to wish" implies involuntariness. Secondly it is taken as a sentence: and then no act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is affirmed. And in this sense "not to wish" does not imply involuntariness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Voluntariness requires an act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the same way as it requires an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; namely, in order that it be in one's power to consider, to wish and to act. And then, just as not to wish, and not to act, when it is time to wish and to act, is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, so is it <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> not to consider.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether violence can be done to the will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> can be done to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For everything can be compelled by that which is more powerful. But there is something, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is more powerful than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will. Therefore it can be compelled, at least by Him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every passive subject is compelled by its active principle, when it is changed by it. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a passive force: for it is a "mover moved" (De Anima iii, 10). Therefore, since it is sometimes moved by its active principle, it seems that sometimes it is compelled.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> movement is that which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is sometimes contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as is clear of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> movement to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv, 20). Therefore the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be compelled.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei v, 10) that what is done by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not done of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Now, whatever is done under compulsion is done of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>: consequently what is done by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, cannot be compelled. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be compelled to act.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is twofold: one is its immediate act, as it were, elicited by it, namely, "to wish"; the other is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> commanded by it, and put into execution by means of some other power, such as "to walk" and "to speak," which are commanded by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to be executed by means of the motive power.

<p>As regards the commanded acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, then, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can suffer <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, in so far as <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> can prevent the exterior members from executing the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> command. But as to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> own proper act, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> cannot be done to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p>The reason of this is that the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is nothing else than an inclination proceeding from the interior principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: just as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is an inclination proceeding from an interior principle without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now what is compelled or <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> is from an exterior principle. Consequently it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> own act, that it should be subject to compulsion and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>: just as it is also contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination or movement. For a stone may have an upward movement from <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, but that this <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> movement be from its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination is impossible. In like manner a man may be dragged by force: but it is contrary to the very notion of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, that he be dragged of his own will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is more powerful than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, can move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse1">Proverbs 21:1</a>: "The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord; whithersoever He will He shall turn it." But if this were by compulsion, it would no longer be by an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, nor would the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> itself be moved, but something else against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not always a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> movement, when a passive subject is moved by its active principle; but only when this is done against the interior inclination of the passive subject. Otherwise every alteration and generation of simply bodies would be unnatural and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>: whereas they are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> interior aptitude of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or subject to such a disposition. In like manner when the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved, according to its own inclination, by the appetible object, this movement is not <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> but <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That to which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, although in reality it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and contrary to the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, nevertheless is apprehended as something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and suitable to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in so far as it is suitable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by reason of some pleasurable sensation or some <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether violence causes involuntariness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> involuntariness. For we speak of voluntariness and involuntariness in respect of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> cannot be done to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as shown above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> involuntariness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is done involuntarily is done with grief, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 24) and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 5) say. But sometimes a man suffers compulsion without being grieved thereby. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> involuntariness.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be involuntary. But some <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> actions proceed from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: for instance, when a man with a heavy body goes upwards; or when a man contorts his limbs in a way contrary to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> flexibility. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> involuntariness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 1) and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 24) say that "things done under compulsion are involuntary."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Violence is directly opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as likewise to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> have this in common, that both are from an intrinsic principle; whereas <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is from an extrinsic principle. And for this reason, just as in things devoid of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> effects something against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: so in things endowed with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it effects something against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now that which is against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is said to be "unnatural"; and in like manner that which is against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is said to be "involuntary." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The involuntary is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Now it has been said (04) that not only the act, which proceeds immediately from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, is called <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, but also the act commanded by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Consequently, as to the act which proceeds immediately from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> cannot be done to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>): wherefore <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> cannot make that act involuntary. But as to the commanded act, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can suffer <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>: and consequently in this respect <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As that is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, which is according to the inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; so that is said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, which is according to the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> in two ways. First, because it is from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as from an active principle: thus it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for fire to produce heat. Secondly, according to a passive principle; because, to wit, there is in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> an inclination to receive an action from an extrinsic principle: thus the movement of the heavens is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude in a heavenly body to receive such movement; although the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that movement is a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> agent. In like manner an act is said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in two ways. First, in regard to action, for instance, when one wishes to be passive to another. Hence when action is brought to bear on something, by an extrinsic agent, as long as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to suffer that action remains in the passive subject, there is not <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> simply: for although the patient does nothing by way of action, he does something by being willing to suffer. Consequently this cannot be called involuntary.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. viii, 4) the movement of an animal, whereby at times an animal is moved against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination of the body, although it is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the body, is nevertheless somewhat <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the animal, to which it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to be moved according to its <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Accordingly this is <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>, not simply but in a certain respect. The same remark applies in the case of one who contorts his limbs in a way that is contrary to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition. For this is <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> in a certain respect, i.e. as to that particular limb; but not simply, i.e. as to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether fear causes involuntariness simply?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fear <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness simply. For just as <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> regards that which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> at the time, so fear regards a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness simply. Therefore fear too <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness simply.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is such of itself, remains such, whatever be added to it: thus what is hot of itself, as long as it remains, is still hot, whatever be added to it. But that which is done through fear, is involuntary in itself. Therefore, even with the addition of fear, it is involuntary.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is such, subject to a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, is such in a certain respect; whereas what is such, without any <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, is such simply: thus what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, subject to a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in some respect: but what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> absolutely, is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> simply. But that which is done through fear, is absolutely involuntary; and is not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, save under a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, namely, in order that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> feared may be avoided. Therefore that which is done through fear, is involuntary simply.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxx.] and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 1) say that such things as are done through fear are "<a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> rather than involuntary."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii) and likewise <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> in his book on Man (Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxx), such things are done through fear "are of a mixed character," being partly <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and partly involuntary. For that which is done through fear, considered in itself, is not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>; but it becomes <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in this particular case, in order, namely, to avoid the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> feared.

<p>But if the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> be considered aright, such things are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> rather than involuntary; for they are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> simply, but involuntary in a certain respect. For a thing is said to be simply, according as it is in act; but according as it is only in apprehension, it is not simply, but in a certain respect. Now that which is done through fear, is in act in so far as it is done. For, since acts are concerned with singulars; and the singular, as such, is here and now; that which is done is in act, in so far as it is here and now and under other individuating circumstances. And that which is done through fear is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, inasmuch as it is here and now, that is to say, in so far as, under the circumstances, it hinders a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which was feared; thus the throwing of the cargo into the sea becomes <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> during the storm, through fear of the danger: wherefore it is clear that it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> simply. And hence it is that what is done out of fear is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, because its principle is within. But if we consider what is done through fear, as outside this particular case, and inasmuch as it is repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, this is merely a consideration of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. And consequently what is done through fear is involuntary, considered in that respect, that is to say, outside the actual circumstances of the case.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Things done through fear and compulsion differ not only according to present and future time, but also in this, that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not consent, but is moved entirely counter to that which is done through compulsion: whereas what is done through fear, becomes <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved towards it, albeit not for its own sake, but on account of something else, that is, in order to avoid an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is feared. For the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act are satisfied, if it be done on account of something else <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> is not only what we wish, for its own sake, as an end, but also what we wish for the sake of something else, as an end. It is clear therefore that in what is done from compulsion, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does nothing inwardly; whereas in what is done through fear, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does something. Accordingly, as <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxx.] says, in order to exclude things done through fear, a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> action is defined as not only one, "the principal whereof is from without," but with the addition, "in which he that suffers <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> concurs not at all"; because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him that is in fear, does concur somewhat in that which he does through fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Things that are such absolutely, remain such, whatever be added to them; for instance, a cold thing, or a white thing: but things that are such relatively, vary according as they are compared with different things. For what is big in comparison with one thing, is small in comparison with another. Now a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, not only for its own sake, as it were absolutely; but also for the sake of something else, as it were relatively. Accordingly, nothing prevents a thing which was not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in comparison with one thing, from becoming <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> when compared with another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which is done through fear, is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> without any <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, that is to say, according as it is actually done: but it is involuntary, under a certain <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, that is to say, if such a fear were not threatening. Consequently, this argument proves rather the opposite.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether concupiscence causes involuntariness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness. For just as fear is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, so is <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. But fear <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness to a certain extent. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> does so too.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as the timid <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through fear acts counter to that which he proposed, so does the incontinent, through <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. But fear <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness to a certain extent. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> does so also.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for voluntariness. But <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> impairs <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 5) that "delight," or the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of pleasure, "destroys the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 24): "The involuntary act deserves mercy or <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, and is done with regret." But neither of these can be said of that which is done out of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> involuntariness.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Concupiscence does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> involuntariness, but on the contrary makes something to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. For a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved to it. Now <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> inclines the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to desire the object of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Therefore the effect of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is to make something to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> rather than involuntary.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fear regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of itself is counter to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> harmonizes with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore fear has a greater tendency than <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> involuntariness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He who acts from fear retains the repugnance of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to that which he does, considered in itself. But he that acts from <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, e.g. an incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, does not retain his former will whereby he repudiated the object of his <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; for his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is changed so that he desires that which previously he repudiated. Accordingly, that which is done out of fear is involuntary, to a certain extent, but that which is done from <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is nowise involuntary. For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who yields to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> acts counter to that which he purposed at first, but not counter to that which he desires now; whereas the timid <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acts counter to that which in itself he desires now.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> were to destroy <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> altogether, as happens with those whom <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> has rendered mad, it would follow that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> would take away voluntariness. And yet properly speaking it would not result in the act being involuntary, because in things bereft of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, there is neither <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> nor involuntary. But sometimes in those actions which are done from <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not completely destroyed, because the power of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> is not taken away entirely, but only the actual consideration in some particular possible act. Nevertheless, this itself is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, according as by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> we mean that which is in the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, for example "not to act" or "not to will," and in like manner "not to consider"; for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can resist the passion, as we shall state later on (10, 3; 77, 7).

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether ignorance causes involuntariness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> involuntariness. For "the involuntary act deserves pardon," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 24). But sometimes that which is done through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not deserve pardon, according to <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse38">1 Corinthians 14:38</a>: "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, he shall not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> involuntariness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> implies <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; according to <a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse22">Proverbs 14:22</a>: "They <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, that work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness, it would follow that every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is involuntary: which is opposed to the saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, that "every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>" (De Vera Relig. xiv).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "involuntariness is not without sadness," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 24). But some things are done out of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but without sadness: for instance, a man may kill a foe, whom he wishes to kill, thinking at the time that he is killing a stag. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> involuntariness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 24) and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 1) say that "what is done through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is involuntary."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness, it is in so far as it deprives one of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of voluntariness, as was declared above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But it is not every <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that deprives one of this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Accordingly, we must take note that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> has a threefold relationship to the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: in one way, "concomitantly"; in another, "consequently"; in a third way, "antecedently." "Concomitantly," when there is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of what is done; but, so that even if it were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, it would be done. For then, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not induce one to wish this to be done, but it just happens that a thing is at the same time done, and not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: thus in the example given (Objection 3) a man did indeed wish to kill his foe, but killed him in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, thinking to kill a stag. And <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of this kind, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. iii, 1), does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> involuntariness, since it is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of anything that is repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: but it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> "non-voluntariness," since that which is unknown cannot be actually willed. <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> is "consequent" to the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in so far as <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> itself is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>: and this happens in two ways, in accordance with the two aforesaid modes of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> (3). First, because the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is brought to bear on the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: as when a man wishes not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that he may have an excuse for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or that he may not be withheld from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; according to <a href="../bible/job021.htm#verse14">Job 21:14</a>: "We desire not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Thy ways." And this is called "affected <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>." Secondly, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, when it regards that which one can and ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: for in this sense "not to act" and "not to will" are said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). And <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of this kind happens, either when one does not actually consider what one can and ought to consider; this is called "<a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> choice," and arises from some passion or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: or when one does not take the trouble to acquire the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which one ought to have; in which sense, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the general principles of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which one to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as being due to negligence. Accordingly, if in either of these ways, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, it cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> involuntariness simply. Nevertheless it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness in a certain respect, inasmuch as it precedes the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> towards the act, which movement would not be, if there were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> is "antecedent" to the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, when it is not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, and yet is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> willing what he would not will otherwise. Thus a man may be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of some circumstance of his act, which he was not bound to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, the result being that he does that which he would not do, if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of that circumstance; for instance, a man, after taking proper precaution, may not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that someone is coming along the road, so that he shoots an arrow and slays a passer-by. Such <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness simply.

<p>From this may be gathered the solution of the objections. For the first objection deals with <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of what a man is bound to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. The second, with <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of choice, which is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> to a certain extent, as stated above. The third, with that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which is concomitant with the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.
