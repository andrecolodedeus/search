<h1>Question 70. Circumcision</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4070.htm#article1"> Was circumcision a preparation for, and a figure of, Baptism?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4070.htm#article2"> Its institution</a> <li><a href="../summa/4070.htm#article3"> Its rite</a> <li><a href="../summa/4070.htm#article4"> Its effect</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether circumcision was a preparation for, and a figure of Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was not a preparation for, and a figure of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For every figure has some likeness to that which it foreshadows. But <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> has no likeness to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore it seems that it was not a preparation for, and a figure of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, speaking of the Fathers of old, says (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 10:2</a>), that "all were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the cloud, and in the sea": but not that they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. Therefore the protecting pillar of a cloud, and the crossing of the Red Sea, rather than <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, were a preparation for, and a figure of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it was stated above (38, 1,3) that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was a preparation for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>. Consequently, if <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was a preparation for, and a figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, it seems that John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was superfluous: which is unseemly. Therefore <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was not a preparation for, and a figure of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse11">Colossians 2:11-12</a>): "You are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> with <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, not made by hand in despoiling the body of the flesh, but in the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, buried with Him in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is called the Sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>; in so far, to wit, as in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is aggregated to the congregation of the faithful. Now our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the same as that of the Fathers of old, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse13">2 Corinthians 4:13</a>): "Having the same spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . we . . . <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>." But <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was a protestation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; wherefore by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> also men of old were aggregated to the body of the faithful. Consequently, it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was a preparation for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and a figure thereof, forasmuch as "all things happened" to the Fathers of old "in figure" (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>); just as their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> regarded things to come.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Circumcision was like <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect of the latter. For just as <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> removed a carnal pellicule, so <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> despoils <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of carnal behavior.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The protecting pillar of cloud and the crossing of the Red Sea were indeed figures of our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, whereby we are born again of water, signified by the Red Sea; and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, signified by the pillar of cloud: yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did not make, by means of these, a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; so that these two things were figures but not <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and a preparation for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; although less clearly figurative of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as to externals, than the aforesaid. And for this reason the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> mentions them rather than <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was a preparation for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> as to the act done: but <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, as to the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is required in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as stated above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether circumcision was instituted in a fitting manner?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was instituted in an unfitting manner. For as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was made in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. But none could ever be delivered from the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse25">Romans 3:25</a>: "Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed to be a propitiation, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His blood." Therefore <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> should have been instituted forthwith after the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and not at the time of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> made profession of keeping the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, just as in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> he makes profession of keeping the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse3">Galatians 5:3</a>): "I testify . . . to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> circumcising himself, that he is a debtor to do the whole Law." But the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was not promulgated at the time of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, but rather at the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Therefore it was unfitting for <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> to be instituted at the time of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was a figure of, and a preparation for, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is offered to all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>: "Going . . . teach ye all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them." Therefore <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> should have been instituted as binding, not the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> only, but also all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, carnal <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> should correspond to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, as the shadow to the reality. But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> which is of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, regards indifferently both sexes, since "in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> there is neither male nor female," as is written in <a href="../bible/col003.htm">Colossians 3</a> [<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse28">Galatians 3:28</a>]. Therefore the institution of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> which concerns only males, was unfitting.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We read (<a href="../bible/gen017.htm">Genesis 17</a>) that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose "works are perfect" (<a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was a preparation for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, inasmuch as it was a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which we also profess in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Now among the Fathers of old, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was the first to receive the promise of the future birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when it was said to him: "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed" (<a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse18">Genesis 22:18</a>). Moreover, he was the first to cut himself off from the society of unbelievers, in accordance with the commandment of the Lord, Who said to him (<a href="../bible/gen013.htm#verse1">Genesis 13:1</a>): "Go forth out of thy country and from thy kindred." Therefore <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was fittingly instituted in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Immediately after the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, on account of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> possessed by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, who was fully instructed about Divine things, both <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> flourished in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to such an extent, that there was no need for any signs of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to be prescribed to him, but each one was wont to make protestation of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by outward signs of his profession, according as he thought best. But about the time of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was on the wane, many being given over to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Moreover, by the growth of carnal <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> was clouded even in regard to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And therefore it was fitting that then, and not before, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> should be instituted, as a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and a remedy against carnal <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was not to be promulgated until the people were already gathered together: because the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is ordained to the public <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as we have stated in I-II, 90, 2. Now it behooved the body of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to be gathered together by a sensible sign, which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order that men be united together in any religion, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix). Consequently, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> to be instituted before the giving of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Those Fathers, however, who lived before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, taught their families concerning Divine things by way of paternal admonition. Hence the Lord said of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> (<a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse19">Genesis 18:19</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he will command his children, and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> contains in itself the perfection of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> calls all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 2:4</a>: "Who will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is offered to all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> did not contain the perfection of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but signified it as to be achieved by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who was to be born of the Jewish nation. For this reason <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was given to that nation alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The institution of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is as a sign of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that himself would be the father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who was promised to him: and for this reason it was suitable that it should be for males only. Again, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, against which <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was specially ordained, is contracted from the father, not from the mother, as was stated in I-II, 81, 5. But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> contains the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for all, and is "The Remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (Post-Communion, Tuesday in Whitweek).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the rite of circumcision was fitting?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the rite of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was unfitting. For <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, as stated above (1,2), was a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is in the apprehensive power, whose operations appear mostly in the head. Therefore the sign of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> should have been conferred on the head rather than on the virile member.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> we make use of such things as are in more frequent use; for instance, water, which is used for washing, and bread, which we use for nourishment. But, in cutting, we use an iron knife more commonly than a stone knife. Therefore <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> should not have been performed with a stone knife.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was instituted as a remedy against <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, so also was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says (Hom. in Circum.). But now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not put off until the eighth day, lest children should be in danger of loss on account of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, if they should die before being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. On the other hand, sometimes <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is put off until after the eighth day. Therefore the eighth day should not have been fixed for <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, but this day should have been anticipated, just as sometimes it was deferred.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The aforesaid rite of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is fixed by a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse11">Romans 4:11</a>: "And he received the sign of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was established, as a sign of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "of" Whose "wisdom there is no number" (<a href="../bible/psa146.htm#verse5">Psalm 146:5</a>). Now to determine suitable signs is a work of wisdom. Consequently, it must be allowed that the rite of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was fitting.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It was fitting for <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> to be performed on the virile member. First, because it was a sign of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would be born of his seed. Secondly, because it was to be a remedy against <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, which is contracted through the act of generation. Thirdly, because it was ordained as a remedy for carnal <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which thrives principally in those members, by reason of the abundance of venereal pleasure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A stone knife was not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. Wherefore we do not find that an instrument of this description is required by any divine precept; nor did the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, as a rule, make use of such a knife for <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; indeed, neither do they now. Nevertheless, certain well-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> circumcisions are related as having been performed with a stone knife, thus (<a href="../bible/exo004.htm#verse25">Exodus 4:25</a>) we read that "Sephora took a very sharp stone and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> the foreskin of her son," and (<a href="../bible/jos005.htm#verse2">Joshua 5:2</a>): "Make thee knives of stone, and circumcise the second time the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." Which signified that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> would be done by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of Whom it is written (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>): "Now the rock was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The eighth day was fixed for <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>: first, because of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>; since, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by taking away from the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, not only guilt but also all penalties, will perfect the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, in the eighth age (which is the age of those that rise again), as it were, on the eighth day. Secondly, on account of the tenderness of the infant before the eighth day. Wherefore even in regard to other animals it is prescribed (<a href="../bible/lev022.htm#verse27">Leviticus 22:27</a>): "When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, they shall be seven days under the udder of their dam: but the eighth day and thenceforth, they may be offered to the Lord."

<p>Moreover, the eighth day was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the fulfilment of the precept; so that, to wit, those who delayed beyond the eighth day, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, even though it were the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse23">John 7:23</a>: "(If) a man receives <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath-day</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a> may not be broken." But it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the validity of the sacrament: because if anyone delayed beyond the eighth day, they could be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> afterwards.

<p>Some also say that in imminent danger of death, it was allowable to anticipate the eighth day. But this cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> either from the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> or from the custom of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>. Wherefore it is better to say with <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> (De Sacram. i) that the eighth day was never anticipated for any motive, however urgent. Hence on <a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse3">Proverbs 4:3</a>: "I was . . . an only son in the sight of my mother," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says, that Bersabee's other baby boy did not count because through dying before the eighth day it received no name; and consequently neither was it <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether circumcision bestowed sanctifying grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> did not bestow <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse21">Galatians 2:21</a>): "If <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died in vain," i.e. without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> imposed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse3">Galatians 5:3</a>: "I testify . . . to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> circumcising himself, that ne is a debtor to do the whole <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died in vain," i.e. without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But this cannot be allowed. Therefore <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> did not confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby the sinner is made righteous.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, before the institution of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone sufficed for <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. iv): "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> alone did of old in behalf of infants that for which the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> avails with us." But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has lost nothing of its strength through the commandment of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone justified little ones, and not <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we read (<a href="../bible/jos005.htm#verse5">Joshua 5:5-6</a>) that "the people that were born in the desert, during the forty years . . . were uncircumcised." If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> was taken away by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, it seems that all who died in the desert, both little children and adults, were lost. And the same argument avails in regard to those who died before the eighth day, which was that of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which day could nol be anticipated, as stated above (3, ad 3).

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, nothing but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> closes the entrance to the heavenly kingdom. But before the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> the entrance to the heavenly kingdom was closed to the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>. Therefore men were not justified from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not remitted without actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being remitted also: because "it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to hope for half forgiveness from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera et Falsa Poenit. ix). But we read nowhere of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> as remitting actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore neither did it remit <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, writing to Valerius in answer to Julian (De Nup. et Concup. i.): "From the time that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was instituted among <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people, as 'a seal of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,' it availed little children unto sanctification by cleansing them from the original and bygone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> also from the time of its institution began to avail unto the renewal of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All are agreed in saying that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> was remitted in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. But some said that no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was conferred, and that the only effect was to remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> holds this opinion (Sent. iv, D, 1), and in a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse11">Romans 4:11</a>. But this is impossible, since guilt is not remitted except by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse2">Romans 3:2</a>: "Being justified freely by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>," etc.

<p>Wherefore others said that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was bestowed by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, as to that effect which is the remission of guilt, but not as to its positive effects; lest they should be compelled to say that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> sufficed for the fulfilling of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, and that, consequently, the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was unnecessary. But neither can this opinion stand. First, because by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> children. received the power of obtaining <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> at the allotted time, which is the last positive effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Secondly, because, in the order of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, positive effects <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precede those that denote privation, although it is the reverse in the order of the material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: since a form does not remove a privation save by informing the subject.

<p>Consequently, others said that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was conferred in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, also as a particular positive effect consisting in being made worthy of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>; but not as to all its effects, for it did not suffice for the repression of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the fomes, nor again for the fulfilment of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. And this was my opinion at one time (Sent. iv, D, 1; 2, 4). But if one consider the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> carefully, it is clear that this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Because the least <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can resist any degree of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, and avoid every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that is committed in transgressing the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; for the smallest degree of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than cupidity loves "thousands of gold and silver" (<a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse72">Psalm 118:72</a>).

<p>We must say, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was bestowed in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> as to all the effects of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but not as in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Because in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is bestowed by the very power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> itself, which power <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> has as the instrument of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> already consummated. Whereas <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> bestowed <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, inasmuch as it was a sign of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> future <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: so that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, professed to embrace that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; whether, being an adult, he made profession for himself, or, being a child, someone else made profession for him. Hence, too, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse11">Romans 4:11</a>), that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> "received the sign of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, a seal of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>": because, to wit, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> was of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> signified: not of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> signifying. And since <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> operates instrumentally by the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> does not, therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> imprints a character that incorporates <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and bestows <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> more copiously than does <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; since greater is the effect of a thing already present, than of the hope thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument would <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> if <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> were of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> otherwise than through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as before the institution of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to come justified both children and adults, so, too, after its institution. But before, there was no need of a sign expressive of this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; because as yet believers had not begun to be united together apart from unbelievers for the worship of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is probable, however, that parents who were believers offered up some <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for their children, especially if these were in any danger. Or bestowed some <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> on them, as a "seal of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>"; just as the adults offered <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for themselves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There was an excuse for the people in the desert failing to fulfil the precept of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, both because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not when the camp was removed, and because, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv) they needed no distinctive sign while they dwelt apart from other nations. Nevertheless, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. in Josue vi), those were guilty of disobedience who failed to obey through contempt.

<p>It seems, however, that none of the uncircumcised died in the desert, for it is written (<a href="../bible/psa104.htm#verse37">Psalm 104:37</a>): "There was not among their tribes one that was feeble": and that those alone died in the desert, who had been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. If, however, some of the uncircumcised did die there, the same applies to them as to those who died before the institution of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. And this applies also to those children who, at the time of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, died before the eighth day.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was taken away in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, in regard to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; but on the part of the entire <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, there remained the obstacle to the entrance of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, which obstacle was removed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Consequently, before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> not even <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> gave entrance to the kingdom. But were <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> to avail after <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, it would give entrance to the kingdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> When adults were <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, they received remission not only of original, but also of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: yet not so as to be delivered from all debt of punishment, as in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conferred more copiously.
