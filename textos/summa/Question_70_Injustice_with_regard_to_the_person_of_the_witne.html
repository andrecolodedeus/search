<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a man is bound to give evidence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man is not bound to give evidence. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> say (QQ. <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>) [Cf. Contra Faust. xxii, 33,34, that when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said of his wife (<a href="../bible/gen020.htm#verse2">Genesis 20:2</a>), "She is my sister," he wished the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be concealed and not a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> be told. Now, by hiding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> a man abstains from giving evidence. Therefore a man is not bound to give evidence.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to act deceitfully. Now it is written (<a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse13">Proverbs 11:13</a>): "He that walketh deceitfully revealeth secrets, but he that is faithful concealeth the thing committed to him by his friend." Therefore a man is not always bound to give evidence, especially on matters committed to him as a secret by a friend.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, more than others, are bound to those things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are forbidden to give evidence when a man is on trial for his life. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to give evidence.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Can. Quisquis, caus. xi, qu. 3, cap. Falsidicus; cf. <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a>, Sentent. iii, 55 says: "Both he who conceals the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and he who tells a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> are guilty, the former because he is unwilling to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the latter because he desires to hurt."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must make a distinction in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of giving evidence: because sometimes a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> evidence is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and sometimes not. If the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> evidence is that of a man subject to a superior whom, in matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, he is bound to obey, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he is bound to give evidence on those points which are required of him in accordance with the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, for instance on manifest things or when ill-report has preceded. If however he is required to give evidence on other points, for instance secret matters, and those of which no ill-report has preceded, he is not bound to give evidence. On the other hand, if his evidence be required by authority of a superior whom he is bound to obey, we must make a distinction: because if his evidence is required in order to deliver a man from an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> death or any other penalty, or from <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> defamation, or some loss, in such cases he is bound to give evidence. Even if his evidence is not demanded, he is bound to do what he can to declare the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to someone who may profit thereby. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa081.htm#verse4">Psalm 81:4</a>): "Rescue the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and deliver the needy from the hand of the sinner"; and (<a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse11">Proverbs 24:11</a>): "Deliver them that are led to death"; and (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse32">Romans 1:32</a>): "They are worthy of death, not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them," on which words a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "To be silent when one can disprove is to consent." On matters pertaining to a man's condemnation, one is not bound to give evidence, except when one is constrained by a superior in accordance with the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; since if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of such a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> be concealed, no particular injury is inflicted on anyone. Or, if some danger threatens the accuser, it matters not since he risked the danger of his own accord: whereas it is different with the accused, who incurs the danger against his will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking of concealment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in a case when a man is not compelled by his superior's authority to declare the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and when such concealment is not specially injurious to any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should by no means give evidence on matters secretly committed to him in confession, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> such things, not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> minister: and the sacrament is more binding than any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> precept. But as regards matters committed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in some other way under secrecy, we must make a distinction. Sometimes they are of such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that one is bound to make them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as soon as they come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, for instance if they conduce to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> or corporal corruption of the community, or to some grave personal injury, in short any like <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> that a man is bound to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> either by giving evidence or by denouncing it. Against such a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> a man cannot be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to act on the plea that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is committed to him under secrecy, for he would break the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he owes to another. On the other hand sometimes they are such as one is not bound to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, so that one may be under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> not to do so on account of their being committed to one under secrecy. On such a case one is by no means bound to make them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, even if the superior should command; because to keep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right, and a man cannot be commanded to do what is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is unbecoming for ministers of the altar to slay a man or to cooperate in his slaying, as stated above (Question 64, Article 4); hence according to the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> they cannot be compelled to give evidence when a man is on trial for his life.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the evidence of two or three persons suffices?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the evidence of two or three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is not sufficient. For judgment requires <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not obtained by the assertions of two or three <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, for we read that Naboth was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> condemned on the evidence of two <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki021.htm">1 Kings 21</a>). Therefore the evidence of two or three <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> does not suffice.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in order for evidence to be credible it must agree. But frequently the evidence of two or three disagrees in some point. Therefore it is of no use for <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in court.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is laid down (Decret. II, qu. iv, can. Praesul.): "A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall not be condemned save on the evidence of seventy-two <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>; nor a cardinal <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Roman Church, unless there be sixty-four <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>. Nor a cardinal <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the Roman Church, unless there be twenty-seven <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>; nor a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a>, an <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a>, a reader or a doorkeeper without seven <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one who is of higher dignity is more grievous, and consequently should be treated more severely. Therefore neither is the evidence of two or three <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> sufficient for the condemnation of other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>): "By the mouth of two or three <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> shall he die that is to be slain," and further on (<a href="../bible/deu019.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>): "In the mouth of two or three <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> every word shall stand."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 3), "we must not expect to find <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> equally in every <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>." For in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, on which judgments are passed and evidence required, it is impossible to have demonstrative <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a>, because they a about things contingent and variable. Hence the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of probability suffices, such as may reach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the greater number, cases, although it fail in the minority. No it is probable that the assertion of sever <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> contains the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> rather than the assertion of one: and since the accused is the only one who denies, while several witness affirm the same as the prosecutor, it is reasonably established both by Divine and by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, that the assertion of several <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> should be upheld. Now all multitude is comprised of three elements, the beginning, the middle and the end. Wherefore, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Coelo i, 1), "we reckon 'all' and 'whole' to consist of three parts." Now we have a triple voucher when two agree with the prosecutor: hence two <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> are required; or for the sake of greater <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> three, which is the perfect number. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc004.htm#verse12">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>): "A threefold cord is not easily broken": and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse17">John 8:17</a>, "The testimony of two men is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>," says (Tract. xxxvi) that "there is here a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> by which we are given to understand that <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> wherein is perpetual stability of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> how great a number of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> may be determined, the evidence might sometimes be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, since is written (<a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse2">Exodus 23:2</a>): "Thou shalt not follow the multitude to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." And yet the fact that in so many it is not possible to have <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> without fear of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, is no reason why we should reject the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> which can probably be had through two or three <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> disagree certain principal circumstances which change the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the fact, for instance in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, place, or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, which are chiefly in question, their evidence is of no weight, because if they disagree in such things, each one would seem to be giving distinct evidence and to be speaking of different facts. For instance, one say that a certain thing happened at such and such a time or place, while another says it happened at another time or place, they seem not to be speaking of the same event. The evidence is not weakened if one witness says that he does not remember, while the other attests to a determinate time or place And if on such points as these the witness for prosecution and defense disagree altogether, and if they be equal in number on either side, and of equal standing, the accused should have the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, because the judge ought to be more inclined to acquit than to condemn, except perhaps in favorable suits, such as a pleading for liberty and the like. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> for the same side disagree, the judge ought to use his own discretion in discerning which side to favor, by considering either the number of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, or their standing, or the favorableness of the suit, or the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the business and of the evidence

<p>Much more ought the evidence of one witness to be rejected if he contradict himself when questioned about what he has seen and about what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; not, however, if he contradict himself when questioned about matters of opinion and report, since he may be moved to answer differently according to the different things he has seen and heard.

<p>On the other hand if there be discrepancy of evidence in circumstances not touching the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the fact, for instance, whether the weather were cloudy or fine, whether the house were painted or not, or such like matters, such discrepancy does not weaken the evidence, because men are not wont to take much notice of such things, wherefore they easily forget them. Ondeed, a discrepancy of this kind renders the evidence more credible, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> states (Hom. i in Matth.), because if the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> agreed in every point, even in the minutest of details, they would seem to have conspired together to say the same thing: but this must be left to the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> discernment of the judge.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This passage refers specially to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of the Roman Church, on account of its dignity: and this for three reasons. First because in that Church those men ought to be promoted whose sanctity makes their evidence of more weight than that of many <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>. Secondly, because those who have to judge other men, often have many opponents on account of their <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, wherefore those who give evidence against them should not be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> indiscriminately, unless they be very numerous. Thirdly, because the condemnation of any one of them would detract in public opinion from the dignity and authority of that Church, a result which would be more fraught with danger than if one were to tolerate a sinner in that same Church, unless he were very <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> and manifest, so that a grave <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> would arise if he were tolerated.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a man's evidence can be rejected without any fault of his?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man's evidence ought not to be rejected except on account of some fault. For it a penalty on some that their evidence is inadmissible, as in the case of those who are branded with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>. Now a penalty must not be inflicted save for a fault. Therefore it would seem that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> evidence ought to be rejected save on account of a fault.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Good is to be presumed of every one, unless the contrary appear" [Cap. Dudum, de Praesumpt.]. Now it pertains to a man's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> that he should give <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> evidence. Since therefore there can be no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the contrary, unless there be some fault of his, it would seem that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> evidence should be rejected save for some fault.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is rendered unfit for things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> except by some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to give <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> evidence, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be excluded from giving evidence save for some fault.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Regist. xiii, 44): "As to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who is said to have been accused by his servants, you are to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they should by no means have been heard": which words are embodied in the Decretals II, qu. 1, can. Imprimis.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the authority of evidence is not <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> but probable; and consequently the evidence for one side is weakened by whatever strengthens the probability of the other. Now the reliability of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> evidence is weakened, sometimes indeed on account of some fault of his, as in the case of unbelievers and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> repute, as well as those who are guilty of a public crime and who are not allowed even to accuse; sometimes, without any fault on his part, and this owing either to a defect in the reason, as in the case of children, imbeciles and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, or to personal feeling, as in the case of enemies, or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> united by <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or household ties, or again owing to some external <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, as in the case of poor people, slaves, and those who are under authority, concerning whom it is to be presumed that they might easily be induced to give evidence against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p>Thus it is manifest that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> evidence may be rejected either with or without some fault of his.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is disqualified from giving evidence this is done as a precaution against <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> evidence rather than as a punishment. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Good is to be presumed of everyone unless the contrary appear, provided this does not threaten injury to another: because, in that case, one ought to be careful not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> everyone readily, according to <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse1">1 John 4:1</a>: "Believe not every spirit."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To give evidence is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, provided the witness be competent, and the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> observed. Hence nothing hinders certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> being excused from giving evidence, if they be considered unfit according to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is always a mortal sin to give false evidence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to give <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> evidence. For a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may happen to give <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> evidence, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of fact. Now such <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> excuses from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the giving of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> evidence is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> that benefits someone and hurts no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is officious, and this is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now sometimes a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> of this kind occurs in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> evidence, as when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> gives <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> evidence in order to save a man from death, or from an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> sentence which threatens him through other <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> or a perverse judge. Therefore in such cases it is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to give <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> evidence.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a witness is required to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in order that he may fear to commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of perjury. But this would not be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, if it were already a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to give <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> evidence. Therefore the giving of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> evidence is not always mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse5">Proverbs 19:5</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness shall not be unpunished."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> False evidence has a threefold deformity. The first is owing to perjury, since <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> are admitted only on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> and on this count it is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Secondly, owing to the violation of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and on this account it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generically, even as any kind of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Hence the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> evidence by the precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> is expressed in this form when it is said (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse16">Exodus 20:16</a>), "Thou shalt not bear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness against thy neighbor." For one does nothing against a man by preventing him from doing someone an injury, but only by taking away his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Thirdly, owing to the falsehood itself, by reason of which every lie is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: on this account, the giving of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> evidence is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In giving evidence a man ought not to affirm as certain, as though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it, that about which he is not certain and he should confess his <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> terms, and that which he is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> about, in terms of <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. Owing however to the frailty of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, a man sometimes thinks he is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> about something that is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and then if after thinking over the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> with due care he deems himself certain about that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> thing, he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally if he asserts it, because the evidence which he gives is not directly an intentionally, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> contrary to what he intends.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgment is not a judgment, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> evidence given in an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgment, in order to prevent <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by virtue of the judgment, but only by reason of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> violated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Men abhor chiefly those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as being most grievous, and among them is perjury: whereas they do not abhor so much <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against their neighbor. Consequently, for the greater <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of evidence, the witness is required to take a <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.
