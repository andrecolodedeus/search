<h1>Question 70. The fruits of the Holy Ghost</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2070.htm#article1"> Are the fruits of the Holy Ghost acts?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2070.htm#article2"> Do they differ from the beatitudes?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2070.htm#article3"> Their number?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2070.htm#article4"> Their opposition to the works of the flesh</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the fruits of the Holy Ghost which the Apostle enumerates (Gal. 5) are acts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, enumerated by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians 5:22-23</a>), are not acts. For that which bears fruit, should not itself be called a fruit, else we should go on indefinitely. But our actions bear fruit: for it is written (<a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse15">Wisdom 3:15</a>): "The fruit of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> labor is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>," and (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse36">John 4:36</a>): "He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting." Therefore our actions are not to be called fruits.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 10), "we enjoy ['Fruimur', from which verb we have the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> 'fructus' and the English 'fruit'] the things we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> rests by rejoicing in them." But our will should not rest in our actions for their own sake. Therefore our actions should not be called fruits.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, among the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> numbers certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, meekness, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not actions but <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, as stated above (Question 55, Article 1). Therefore the fruits are not actions.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse33">Matthew 12:33</a>): "By the fruit the tree is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>"; that is to say, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by his works, as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men explain the passage. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are called fruits.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word "fruit" has been transferred from the material to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> world. Now fruit, among material things, is the product of a plant when it comes to perfection, and has a certain sweetness. This fruit has a twofold relation: to the tree that produces it, and to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who gathers the fruit from the tree. Accordingly, in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters, we may take the word "fruit" in two ways: first, so that the fruit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is likened to the tree, is that which he produces; secondly, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> fruit is what he gathers. Yet not all that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gathers is fruit, but only that which is last and gives pleasure. For a man has both a field and a tree, and yet these are not called fruits; but that only which is last, to wit, that which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> intends to derive from the field and from the tree. In this sense <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> fruit is his last end which is intended for his enjoyment.

<p>If, however, by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> fruit we understand a product of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, then <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are called fruits: because operation is the second act of the operator, and gives pleasure if it is suitable to him. If then <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> operation proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in virtue of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it is said to be the fruit of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: but if it proceeds from him in respect of a higher power, which is the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, then <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> operation is said to be the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as of a Divine seed, for it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse9">1 John 3:9</a>): "Whosoever is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, committeth no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for His seed abideth in him."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since fruit is something last and final, nothing hinders one fruit bearing another fruit, even as one end is subordinate to another. And so our works, in so far as they are produced by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> working in us, are fruits: but, in so far as they are referred to the end which is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, they should rather be called flowers: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse23">Sirach 24:23</a>): "My flowers are the fruits of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is said to delight in a thing for its own sake, this may be understood in two ways. First, so that the expression "for the sake of" be taken to designate the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and in this way, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> delights in nothing for its own sake, except the last end. Secondly, so that it expresses the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and in this way, a man may delight in anything that is delightful by reason of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Thus it is clear that a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> delights in health, for its own sake, as in an end; in a nice medicine, not as in an end, but as in something tasty; and in a nasty medicine, nowise for its own sake, but only for the sake of something else. Accordingly we must say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> must delight in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for His own sake, as being his last end, and in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, not as being his end, but for the sake of their inherent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which is delightful to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Parad. xiii) that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are called fruits because "they refresh those that have them, with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and genuine delight."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sometimes the names of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are applied to their actions: thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> writes (Tract. xl in Joan.): "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what thou seest not"; and (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 10): "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is the movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor." It is thus that the names of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are used in reckoning the fruits.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the fruits differ from the beatitudes?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the fruits do not differ from the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are assigned to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, as stated above (69, 1, ad 1). But the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in so far as he is moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> themselves are fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the fruit of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> is to future beatitude which is that of actual possession, so are the fruits of the present life to the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> of the present life, which are based on hope. Now the fruit of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> is identified with future beatitude. Therefore the fruits of the present life are the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fruit is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> something ultimate and delightful. Now this is the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of beatitude, as stated above (3, 1; 4, 1). Therefore fruit and beatitude have the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and consequently should not be distinguished from one another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Things divided into different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, differ from one another. But fruits and <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are divided into different parts, as is clear from the way in which they are enumerated. Therefore the fruits differ from the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> More is required for a beatitude than for a fruit. Because it is sufficient for a fruit to be something ultimate and delightful; whereas for a beatitude, it must be something perfect and excellent. Hence all the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> may be called fruits, but not vice versa. For the fruits are any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in which one delights: whereas the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are none but perfect works, and which, by reason of their perfection, are assigned to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> rather than to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as already stated (69, 1, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument proves the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> to be fruits, but not that all the fruits are <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The fruit of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> is ultimate and perfect simply: hence it nowise differs from future beatitude. On the other hand the fruits of the present life are not simply ultimate and perfect; wherefore not all the fruits are <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> More is required for a beatitude than for a fruit, as stated.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the fruits are suitably enumerated by the Apostle?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the fruits are unsuitably enumerated by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). Because, elsewhere, he says that there is only one fruit of the present life; according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse22">Romans 6:22</a>: "You have your fruit unto sanctification." Moreover it is written (<a href="../bible/isa027.htm#verse9">Isaiah 27:9</a>): "This is all the fruit . . . that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> . . . be taken away." Therefore we should not reckon twelve fruits.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, fruit is the product of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> seed, as stated (1). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> mentions (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse23">Matthew 13:23</a>) a threefold fruit as growing from a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> seed in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ground, viz. "hundredfold, sixtyfold," and "thirtyfold." Therefore one should not reckon twelve fruits.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of fruit is to be something ultimate and delightful. But this does not apply to all the fruits mentioned by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>: for patience and long-suffering seem to imply a painful object, while <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not something ultimate, but rather something primary and fundamental. Therefore too many fruits are enumerated.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> On the other hand, It seems that they are enumerated insufficiently and incompletely. For it has been stated (2) that all the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> may be called fruits; yet not all are mentioned here. Nor is there anything corresponding to the acts of wisdom, and of many other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore it seems that the fruits are insufficiently enumerated.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The number of the twelve fruits enumerated by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is suitable, and that there may be a reference to them in the twelve fruits of which it is written (<a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse2">Apocalypse 22:2</a>): "On both sides of the river was the tree bearing twelve fruits." Since, however, a fruit is something that proceeds from a source as from a seed or root, the difference between these fruits must be gathered from the various ways in which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds in us: which process consists in this, that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is set in order, first of all, in regard to itself; secondly, in regard to things that are near it; thirdly, in regard to things that are below it.

<p>Accordingly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind is well disposed in regard to itself when it has a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things and towards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things. Now the first disposition of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind towards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is effected by love, which is the first of our emotions and the root of them all, as stated above (Question 27, Article 4). Wherefore among the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, we reckon "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," wherein the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is given in a special manner, as in His own likeness, since He Himself is love. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is given to us." The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> result of the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: because every lover rejoices at being united to the beloved. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> has always actual presence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whom it loves, according to <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse16">1 John 4:16</a>: "He that abideth in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, abideth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Him": wherefore the sequel of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>." Now the perfection of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is peace in two respects. First, as regards freedom from outward disturbance; for it is impossible to rejoice perfectly in the beloved <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if one is disturbed in the enjoyment thereof; and again, if a man's heart is perfectly set at peace in one object, he cannot be disquieted by any other, since he accounts all others as nothing; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse165">Psalm 118:165</a>): "Much peace have they that love Thy Law, and to them there is no stumbling-block," because, to wit, external things do not disturb them in their enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Secondly, as regards the calm of the restless desire: for he does not perfectly rejoice, who is not satisfied with the object of his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Now peace implies these two things, namely, that we be not disturbed by external things, and that our desires rest altogether in one object. Wherefore after <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, "peace" is given the third place. In <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> has a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition, in respect of two things. First, by not being disturbed whenever <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> threatens: which pertains to "patience"; secondly, by not being disturbed, whenever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are delayed; which belongs to "long suffering," since "to lack <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>" (Ethic. v, 3).

<p>Man's mind is well disposed as regards what is near him, viz. his neighbor, first, as to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and to this belongs "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>." Secondly, as to the execution of well-doing; and to this belongs "benignity," for the benign are those in whom the salutary flame [bonus ignis] of love has enkindled the desire to be kind to their neighbor. Thirdly, as to his suffering with equanimity the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> his neighbor inflicts on him. To this belongs "meekness," which curbs <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Fourthly, in the point of our refraining from doing harm to our neighbor not only through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but also through <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> or deceit. To this pertains "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," if we take it as denoting fidelity. But if we take it for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed thereby to that which is above him, so that he subject his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and, consequently, all that is his, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Man is well disposed in respect of that which is below him, as regards external action, by "modesty," whereby we observe the "mode" in all our words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>: as regards internal desires, by "contingency" and "<a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>": whether these two differ because <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> withdraws <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from unlawful desires, contingency also from lawful desires: or because the continent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, but is not led away; whereas the chaste <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is neither subject to, nor led away from them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sanctification is effected by all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, by which also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are taken away. Consequently fruit is mentioned there in the singular, on account of its being generically one, though divided into many <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which are spoken of as so many fruits.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold fruits do not differ as various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts, but as various degrees of perfection, even in the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Thus contingency of the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> state is said to be signified by the thirtyfold fruit; the contingency of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a>, by the sixtyfold; and virginal contingency, by the hundredfold fruit. There are, moreover, other ways in which <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men distinguish three evangelical fruits according to the three degrees of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and they speak of three degrees, because the perfection of anything is considered with respect to its beginning, its middle, and its end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fact of not being disturbed by painful things is something to delight in. And as to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if we consider it as the foundation, it has the aspect of being ultimate and delightful, in as much as it contains <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>: hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds thus: "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, which is certainly about the unseen."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> had no <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of teaching us how many [either works of the flesh, or fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>] there are; but to show how the former should be avoided, and the latter sought after." Hence either more or fewer fruits might have been mentioned. Nevertheless, all the acts of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can be reduced to these by a certain kind of fittingness, in so far as all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> must needs direct the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in one of the above-mentioned ways. Wherefore the acts of wisdom and of any <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> directing to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, are reduced to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and peace. The reason why he mentions these rather than others, is that these imply either enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, or relief from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, which things seem to belong to the notion of fruit.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the fruits of the Holy Ghost are contrary to the works of the flesh?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are not contrary to the works of the flesh, which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> enumerates (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians 5:19, seqq.</a>). Because contraries are in the same genus. But the works of the flesh are not called fruits. Therefore the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> are not contrary to them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one thing has a contrary. Now the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> mentions more works of the flesh than fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>. Therefore the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> and the works of the flesh are not contrary to one another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, among the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the first place is given to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and peace: to which, fornication, <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, and immodesty, which are the first of the works of the flesh are not opposed. Therefore the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> are not contrary to the works of the flesh.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians 5:17</a>) that "the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusteth</a> against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The works of the flesh and the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> may be taken in two ways. First, in general: and in this way the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> considered in general are contrary to the works of the flesh. Because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind to that which is in accord with reason, or rather to that which surpasses reason: whereas the fleshly, viz. the sensitive, <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> draws <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to sensible goods which are beneath him. Wherefore, since upward and downward are contrary movements in the physical order, so in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions the works of the flesh are contrary to the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.

<p>Secondly, both fruits and fleshly works as enumerated may be considered singly, each according to its specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And in this they are not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> contrary each to each: because, as stated above (3, ad 4), the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> did not intend to enumerate all the works, whether <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> or carnal. However, by a kind of adaptation, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, commenting on <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, contrasts the fruits with the carnal works, each to each. Thus "to fornication, which is the love of satisfying <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> outside lawful wedlock, we may contrast <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is wedded to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherein also is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> chastity. By <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> we must understand whatever disturbances arise from fornication: and to these the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of tranquillity is opposed. Idolatry, by reason of which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was waged against the Gospel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is opposed to peace. Against witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths and quarrels, there is longsuffering, which helps us to bear the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> inflicted on us by those among whom we dwell; while kindness helps us to cure those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, to forgive them. In contrast to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> there is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, mildness; to drunkenness and revellings, contingency."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That which proceeds from a tree against the tree's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is not called its fruit, but rather its corruption. And since works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are connatural to reason, while works of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, therefore it is that works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are called fruits, but not so works of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> "Good happens in one way, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in all manner of ways," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv): so that to one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> many <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are contrary. Consequently we must not be surprised if the works of the flesh are more numerous than the fruits of the spirit.

<p>The Reply to the Third Objection is clear from what has been said.
