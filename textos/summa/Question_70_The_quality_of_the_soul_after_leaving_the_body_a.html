<h1>Question 70. The quality of the soul after leaving the body, and of the punishment inflicted on it by material fire</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5070.htm#article1"> Do the sensitive powers remain in the separated soul?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5070.htm#article2"> Do the acts of the aforesaid powers remain in the soul?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5070.htm#article3"> Can the separated soul suffer from a material fire?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the sensitive powers remain in the separated soul? [Cf. I, 77, 8]</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the sensitive powers remain in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Spir. et Anim. xv): "The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> withdraws from the body taking all with itself, sense and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, reason, understanding and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> and irascible powers." Now sense, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> and irascible are sensitive powers. Therefore the sensitive powers remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Eccl. Dogm. xvi): "We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> alone has a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which lives though separated from the body, and clings keenly to its senses and wits." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> retains its senses after being separated from the body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers are either its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> parts as some maintain, or at least are its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> properties. Now that which is in a thing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> cannot be separated from it, nor is a subject severed from its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> properties. Therefore it is impossible for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to lose any of its powers after being separated from the body.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a whole is not entire if one of its parts be lacking. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers are called its parts. Therefore, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> lose any of its powers after death, it will not be entire after death: and this is unfitting.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers co-operate in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> more even than the body, since the body is a mere instrument of action, while the powers are principles of action. Now the body must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be rewarded together with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since it co-operated in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Much more, therefore, is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be rewarded together with it. Therefore the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not lose them.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after separation from the body loses its sensitive power, that must needs come to naught. For it cannot be said that it is dissolved into some <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since it has no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as a part of itself. Now that which entirely comes to naught is not restored in identity; wherefore at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will not have the same identical sensitive powers. Now according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, 1), as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to the body so are the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers to the parts of the body, for instance the sight to the eye. But if it were not identically the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that returns to the body, it would not be identically the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore for the same reason it would not be identically the same eye, if the visual power were not identically the same; and in like manner no other part would rise again in identity, and consequently neither would the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be identically the same. Therefore it is impossible for the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to lose its sensitive powers.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, if the sensitive powers were to be corrupted when the body is corrupted, it would follow that they are weakened when the body is weakened. Yet this is not the case, for according to De Anima i, "if an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were given the eye of a young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he would, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, see as well as a young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore neither are the sensitive powers corrupted when the body is corrupted.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Eccl. Dogm. xix): "Of two <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> alone does <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> consist, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body: the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with its reason, and the body with its senses." Therefore the sensitive powers belong to the body: and consequently when the body is corrupted the sensitive powers remain not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, speaking of the separation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, expresses himself thus (Metaph. xi, 3): "If, however, anything remain at last, we must ask what this is: because in certain subjects it is not impossible, for instance if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be of such a disposition, not the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; for as regards the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> this is probably impossible." Hence it seems that the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not separated from the body, but only the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and consequently not the sensitive or vegetative powers.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, speaking of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, says (De Anima ii, 2): "This alone is ever separated, as the everlasting from the corruptible: for it is hereby clear that the remaining parts are not separable as some maintain." Therefore the sensitive powers do not remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are many opinions on this question. For some, holding the view that all the powers are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the same way as color is in a body, hold that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body takes all its powers away with it: because, if it lacked any one of them, it would follow that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is changed in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> properties, since these cannot change so long as their subject remains. But the aforesaid view is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, for since a power is so called because it enables us to do or suffer something, and since to do and to be able belong to the same subject, it follows that the subject of a power is the same as that which is agent or patient. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Somn. et Vigil.) that "where we find power there we find action." Now it is evident that certain operations, whereof the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers are the principles, do not belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> properly speaking but to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as united to the body, because they are not performed except through the medium of the body--such as to see, to hear, and so forth. Hence it follows that such like powers belong to the united <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body as their subject, but to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as their quickening principle, just as the form is the principle of the properties of a composite being. Some operations, however, are performed by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without a bodily organ--for instance to understand, to consider, to will: wherefore, since these actions are proper to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the powers that are the principles thereof belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> not only as their principle but also as their subject. Therefore, since so long as the proper subject remains its proper <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> must also remain, and when it is corrupted they also must be corrupted, it follows that these powers which use no bodily organ for their actions must needs remain in the separated body, while those which use a bodily organ must needs be corrupted when the body is corrupted: and such are all the powers belonging to the sensitive and the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. On this account some draw a distinction in the sensitive powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for they say that they are of two kinds--some being acts of organs and emanating from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into the body are corrupted with the body; others, whence the former originate, are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because by them the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sensitizes the body for seeing, hearing, and so on; and these primary powers remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But this statement seems unreasonable: because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and not through the medium of certain other powers, is the origin of those powers which are the acts of organs, even as any form, from the very fact that by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> it informs its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, is the origin of the properties which result <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> in the composite. For were it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to suppose other powers in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by means of which the powers that perfect the organs may flow from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for the same reason it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to suppose other powers by means of which these mean powers flow from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and so on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, and if we have to stop it is better to do so at the first step.

<p>Hence others say that the sensitive and other like powers do not remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> except in a restricted sense, namely radically, in the same way as a result is in its principle: because there remains in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the ability to produce these powers if it should be reunited to the body; nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for this ability to be anything in addition to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above. This opinion appears to be the more reasonable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is to be understood as meaning that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> takes away with it some of those powers actually, namely understanding and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, and some radically, as stated above [Cf. I, 77, 8, ad 1 and infra 2, ad 1].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The senses which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> takes away with it are not these external senses, but the internal, those, namely, which pertain to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part, for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is sometimes called sense, as <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> states in his commentary on the Proverbs, and again the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 11). If, however, he means the external senses we must reply as above to the first objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above, the sensitive powers are related to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> to their subject, but as compared to their origin: wherefore the conclusion does not follow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are not called its integral but its <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> parts. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of such like wholes is that the entire energy of the whole is found perfectly in one of the parts, but partially in the others; thus in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> energy is found perfectly in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part, but partially in the others. Wherefore, as the powers of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the latter will remain entire and undiminished, although the sensitive powers do not remain actually: as neither is the king's power decreased by the death of a mayor who shared his authority.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The body co-operates in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, as an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. The sensitive powers, however, do not co-operate thus, since they are of the genus of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The powers of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are said to be acts of the organs, not as though they were the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> forms of those organs, except in reference to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> whose powers they are. But they are the acts of the organs, by perfecting them for their proper operations, as heat is the act of fire by perfecting it for the purpose of heating. Wherefore, just as a fire would remain identically the same, although another <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> heat were in it (even so the cold of water that has been heated returns not identically the same, although the water remains the same in identity), so the organs will be the same identically, although the powers be not identically the same.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking there of these powers as being rooted in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This is clear from his saying that "old age is an affection not of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but of that in which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is," namely the body. For in this way the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are neither weakened nor corrupted on account of the body.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the acts of the sensitive powers remain in the separated soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the acts of the sensitive powers remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Spiritu et Anima xv): "When the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> leaves the body it derives pleasure or sorrow through being affected with these" (namely the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> and irascible faculties) "according to its <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, and the irascible are sensitive powers. Therefore the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be affected as regards the sensitive powers, and consequently will be in some act by reason of them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii) that "the body feels not, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through the body," and further on: "The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> feels certain things, not through the body but without the body." Now that which befits the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without the body can be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will then be able to feel actually.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to see images of bodies, as occurs in sleep, belongs to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision which is in the sensitive part. Now it happens that the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sees images of bodies in the same way as when we sleep. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii): "For I see not why the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has an image of its own body when, the body lying senseless, yet not quite dead, it sees some things which many have related after returning to life from this suspended animation and yet has it not when it has left the body through death having taken place." For it is unintelligible that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should have an image of its body, except in so far as it sees that image: wherefore he said before of those who lie senseless that "they have a certain image of their own body, by which they are able to be borne to corporeal places and by means of sensible images to take cognizance of such things as they see." Therefore the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can exercise the acts of the sensitive powers.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is a power of the sensitive part, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in De Memor. et Remin. i. Now separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will actually remember the things they did in this world: wherefore it is said to the rich <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">glutton</a> (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse25">Luke 16:25</a>): "Remember that thou didst receive <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in thy lifetime." Therefore the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will exercise the act of a sensitive power.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, 9) the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> are in the sensitive part. But <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sorrow, love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, fear and hope, and similar emotions which according to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we hold to be in separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, are in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>. Therefore separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will not be deprived of the acts of the sensitive powers.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which is common to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body cannot remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now all the operations of the sensitive powers are common to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body: and this is evident from the fact that no sensitive power exercises an act except through a bodily organ. Therefore the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be deprived of the acts of the sensitive powers.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima i, 4), that "when the body is corrupted, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> neither remembers nor loves," and the same applies to all the acts of the sensitive powers. Therefore the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not exercise the act of any sensitive power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some distinguish two kinds of acts in the sensitive powers: external acts which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> exercises through the body. and these do not remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and internal acts which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> performs by itself; and these will be in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This statement would seem to have originated from the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who held that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body, as a perfect <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> nowise dependant on the body, and merely as a mover is united to the thing moved. This is an evident consequence of transmigration which he held. And since according to him nothing is in motion except what is moved, and lest he should go on indefinitely, he said that the first mover moves itself, and he maintained that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its own movement. Accordingly there would be a twofold movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, one by which it moves itself, and another whereby the body is moved by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: so that this act "to see" is first of all in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself as moving itself, and secondly in the bodily organ in so far as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> moves the body. This opinion is refuted by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima i, 3) who proves that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not move itself, and that it is nowise moved in respect of such operations as seeing, feeling, and the like, but that such operations are movements of the composite only. We must therefore conclude that the acts of the sensitive powers nowise remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, except perhaps as in their remote origin.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some deny that this book is <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a>: for it is ascribed to a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> who compiled it from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> works and added things of his own. Hence we are not to take what is written there, as having authority. If, however, its authority should be maintained, it must be said that the meaning is that the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is affected with <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and other like powers, not as though such affection were the act of the aforesaid powers, but in the sense that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be affected in the future life for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or ill, according to the things which it committed in the body through the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and other like powers: so that the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and such like powers are not supposed to elicit that affection, but to have elicited in the body the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of that affection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is said to feel through the body, not as though the act of feeling belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by itself, but as belonging to the whole composite by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, just as we say that heat heats. That which is added, namely that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> feels some things without the body, such as fear and so forth, means that it feels such things without the outward movement of the body that takes place in the acts of the proper senses: since fear and like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> do not occur without any bodily movement.

<p>It may also be replied that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking according to the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> who maintained this as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks there as nearly throughout that book, as one inquiring and not deciding. For it is clear that there is no comparison between the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a sleeper and the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the sleeper uses the organ of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> wherein corporeal images are impressed; which cannot be said of the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Or we may reply that images of things are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, both as to the sensitive and imaginative power and as to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power, with greater or lesser abstraction from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and material conditions. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> comparison holds in this respect that just as the images of corporeal things are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the dreamer or of one who is carried out of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, imaginatively, so are they in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> intellectively: but not that they are in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> imaginatively.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As stated in the first book (Sent. i, D, 3, qu. 4), <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> has a twofold signification. Sometimes it means a power of the sensitive part, in so far as its gaze extends over past time; and in this way the act of the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> will not be in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima i, 4) that "when this," the body to wit, "is corrupted, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remembers not." In another way <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is used to designate that part of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> faculty, in so far namely as it abstracts from all differences of time, since it regards not only the past but also the present, and the future as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 11). Taking <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> in this sense the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will remember [Cf. I, 77, 8; I, 89, 6].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Love, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, sorrow, and the like, have a twofold signification. Sometimes they denote <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and thus they will not be in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because in this way they are not exercised without a definite movement of the heart. In another way they denote acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part: and in this way they will be in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even as delight will be there without bodily movement, even as it is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely in so far as it is a simple movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. In this sense the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 14) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is one simple delight."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the separated soul can suffer from a bodily fire?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot suffer from a bodily fire. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii): "The things that affect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> well or ill after its separation from the body, are not corporeal but resemble corporeal things." Therefore the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not punished with a bodily fire.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii) says that "the agent is always more excellent than the patient." But it is impossible for any body to be more excellent than the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore it cannot suffer from a body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Gener. i) and <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Duab. Natur.) only those things that agree in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are active and passive in relation to one another. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and corporeal fire do not agree in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since there is no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> common to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and corporeal things: wherefore they cannot be changed into one another, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Duab. Natur.). Therefore the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not suffer from a bodily fire.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whatsoever is patient receives something from the agent. Therefore if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffer from the bodily fire, it will receive something therefrom. Now whatsoever is received in a thing is received according to the mode of the recipient. Therefore that which is received in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the fire, is in it not materially but spiritually. Now the forms of things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> spiritually in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are its perfections. Therefore though it be granted that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffer from the bodily fire, this will not conduce to its punishment, but rather to its perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if it be said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is punished merely by seeing the fire, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> would seem to say (Dial. iv, 29).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sees the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, it cannot see it save by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision, since it has not the organs by which sensitive or imaginative vision is effected. But it would seem impossible for <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow, since "there is no sorrow contrary to the pleasure of considering," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Topic. i, 13). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not punished by that vision.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, if it be said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers from the corporeal fire, through being held thereby, even as now it is held by the body while living in the body; on the contrary, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> while living in the body is held by the body in so far as there results one thing from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the body, as from form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will not be the form of that corporeal fire. Therefore it cannot be held by the fire in the manner aforesaid.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, every bodily agent acts by contact. But a corporeal fire cannot be in contact with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since contact is only between corporeal things whose bounds come together. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers not from that fire.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, an organic agent does not act on a remote object, except through acting on the intermediate objects; wherefore it is able to act at a fixed distance in proportion to its power. But <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or at least the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to whom this equally applies, are sometimes outside the place of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, since sometimes they appear to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> even in this world: and yet they are not then free from punishment, for just as the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is never interrupted, so neither is the punishment of the damned. And yet we do not find that all the intermediate things suffer from the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>: nor again is it credible that any corporeal thing of an elemental <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has such a power that its action can reach to such a distance. Therefore it does not seem that the pains suffered by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the damned are inflicted by a corporeal fire.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The possibility of suffering from a corporeal fire is equally consistent with separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> suffer therefrom since they are punished by that fire into which the bodies of the damned will be cast after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, and which must needs be as corporeal fire. This is evident from the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew 25:41</a>), "Depart from Me, you <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a>, into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>," etc. Therefore separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> also can suffer from that fire.

<p>Further, punishment should correspond to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> subjected itself to the body by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Therefore it is just that it should be punished by being made subject to a bodily thing by suffering therefrom.

<p>Further, there is greater union between form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> than between agent and patient. Now the diversity of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not hinder the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from being the form of the body. Therefore neither is it an obstacle to its suffering from a body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Given that the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is not so called metaphorically, nor an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> fire, but a real corporeal fire, we must needs say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will suffer punishment from a corporeal fire, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew 25:41</a>) that this fire was prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are incorporeal even as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But how it is that they can thus suffer is explained in many ways.

<p>For some have said that the mere fact that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sees the fire makes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffer from the fire: wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Dial. iv, 29) says: "The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers from the fire by merely seeing it." But this does not seem sufficient, because whatever is seen, from the fact that it is seen, is a perfection of the seer. wherefore it cannot conduce to his punishment, as seen. Sometimes, however, it is of a penal or unpleasant <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in so far, to wit, as it is apprehended as something hurtful, and consequently, besides the fact that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sees the fire, there must needs be some relation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the fire, according to which the fire is hurtful to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>Hence others have said that although a corporeal fire cannot burn the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> nevertheless apprehends it as hurtful to itself, and in consequence of this apprehension is seized with fear and sorrow, in fulfillment of <a href="../bible/psa013.htm#verse5">Psalm 13:5</a>, "They have trembled for fear, where there was no fear." Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. iv, 29) that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> burns through seeing itself aflame." But this, again, seems insufficient, because in this case the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would suffer from the fire, not in reality but only in apprehension: for although a real passion of sorrow or pain may result from a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (Gen. ad lit. xii), it cannot be said in relation to that passion that one really suffers from the thing, but from the image of the thing that is present to one's fancy. Moreover, this kind of suffering would be more unlike real suffering than that which results from <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, since the latter is stated to result from real images of things, which images the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> carries about with it, whereas the former results from <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> fancies which the erring <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagines</a>: and furthermore, it is not probable that separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who are endowed with keen <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, would think it possible for a corporeal fire to hurt them, if they were nowise distressed thereby.

<p>Hence others say that it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to admit that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers even really from the corporeal fire: wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. iv, 29): "We can gather from the words of the Gospel, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers from the fire not only by seeing it, but also by feeling it." They explain the possibility of this as follows. They say that this corporeal fire can be considered in two ways. First, as a corporeal thing, and thus it has not the power to act on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Secondly, as the instrument of the vengeance of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For the order of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> demands that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> subjected itself to corporeal things should be subjected to them also in punishment. Now an instrument acts not only in virtue of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but also in virtue of the principal agent: wherefore it is not unreasonable if that fire, seeing that it acts in virtue of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> agent, should act on the spirit of a man or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, in the same way as we have explained the sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (III, 62, 1,4).

<p>But, again, this does not seem to suffice, since every instrument, in acting on that on which it is used instrumentally, has its own connatural action besides the action whereby it acts in virtue of the principal agent: in fact it is by fulfilling the former that it effects the latter action, even as, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, it is by laving the body that water sanctifies the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the saw by cutting wood produces the shape of a house.

<p>Hence we must allow the fire to exercise on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> an action connatural to the fire, in order that it may be the instrument of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and for this reason we must say that a body cannot <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> act on a spirit, nor in any way be hurtful or distressful to it, except in so far as the latter is in some way united to a body: for thus we observe that "the corruptible body is a load upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" (<a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom 9:15</a>). Now a spirit is united to a body in two ways. In one way as form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so that from their union there results one thing simply: and the spirit that is thus united to a body both quickens the body and is somewhat burdened by the body: but it is not thus that the spirit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> is united to the corporeal fire. In another way as the mover is united to the things moved, or as a thing placed is united to place, even as incorporeal things are in a place. In this way <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> incorporeal spirits are confined to a place, being in one place in such a way as not to be in another. Now although of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> a corporeal thing is able to confine an incorporeal spirit to a place, it is not able of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to detain an incorporeal spirit in the place to which it is confined, and so to tie it to that place that it be unable to seek another, since a spirit is not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in a place so as to be subject to place. But the corporeal fire is enabled as the instrument of the vengeance of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> thus to detain a spirit; and thus it has a penal effect on it, by hindering it from fulfilling its own will, that is by hindering it from acting where it will and as it will.

<p>This way is asserted by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Dial. iv, 29). For in explaining how the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can suffer from that fire by feeling it, he expresses himself as follows: "Since Truth declares the rich sinner to be condemned to fire, will any wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deny that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are imprisoned in flames?" Julian [Bishop of Toledo, Prognostic ii, 17] says the same as quoted by the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iv, D, 44): "If the incorporeal spirit of a living <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is held by the body, why shall it not be held after death by a corporeal fire?" and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 10) that "just as, although the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and the body corporeal, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is so fashioned that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body as giving it life, and on account of this union conceives a great love for its body, so it is chained to the fire, as receiving punishment therefrom, and from this union conceives a loathing."

<p>Accordingly we must unite all the aforesaid modes together, in order to understand perfectly how the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers from a corporeal fire: so as to say that the fire of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is able to have an incorporeal spirit united to it as a thing placed is united to a place; that as the instrument of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> it is enabled to detain it enchained as it were, and in this respect this fire is really hurtful to the spirit, and thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> seeing the fire as something hurtful to it is tormented by the fire. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Dial. iv, 29) mentions all these in order, as may be seen from the above quotations.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks there as one inquiring: wherefore he expresses himself otherwise when deciding the point, as quoted above (De Civ. Dei xxi). Or we may reply that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> means to say that the things which are the proximate occasion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> pain or sorrow are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, since it would not be distressed unless it apprehended the fire as hurtful to it: wherefore the fire as apprehended is the proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its distress, whereas the corporeal fire which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the remote <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its distress.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is simply more excellent than the fire, the fire is relatively more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in so far, to wit, as it is the instrument of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> are speaking of the action whereby the patient is changed into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the agent. Such is not the action of the fire on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and consequently the argument is not conclusive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> By acting on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the fire bestows nothing on it but detains it, as stated above. Hence the argument is not to the point.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision sorrow is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the fact that something is seen, since the thing seen as such can nowise be contrary to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But in the sensible vision the thing seen, by its very action on the sight so as to be seen, there may be <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> something corruptive of the sight, in so far as it destroys the harmony of the organ Nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sorrow, in so far as the thing seen is apprehended as hurtful, not that it hurts through being seen, but in some other way no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which. It is thus that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in seeing the fire is distressed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The comparison does not hold in every respect, but it does in some, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> Although there is no bodily contact between the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, there is a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> contact between them (even as the mover of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, being <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, touches the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, when it moves it, with a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> contact) in the same way as a "painful object is said to touch," as stated in De Gener. i. This mode of contact is sufficient for action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the damned are never outside <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, except by Divine permission, either for the instruction or for the trial of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>. And wherever they are outside <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> they nevertheless always see the fire thereof as prepared for their punishment. Wherefore, since this vision is the immediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their distress, as stated above, wherever they are, they suffer from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell-fire</a>. Even so prisoners, though outside the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, suffer somewhat from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, seeing themselves condemned thereto. Hence just as the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> is not diminished, neither as to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, nor as to the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward, if they happen to be outside the empyrean, in fact this somewhat conduces to their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, so the punishment of the damned is nowise diminished, if by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> permission they happen to be outside <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> for a time. A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse6">James 3:6</a>, "inflameth the wheel of our nativity," etc., is in agreement with this, for it is worded thus: "The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, wherever he is, whether in the air or under the earth, drags with him the torments of his flames." But the objection argues as though the corporeal fire tortured the spirit immediately in the same way as it torments bodies.
