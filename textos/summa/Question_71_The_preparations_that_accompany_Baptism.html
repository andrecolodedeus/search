<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether catechism should precede Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> should not precede <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> men are regenerated unto the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> begins to live before being taught. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not be <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechized</a>, i.e. taught, before being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is given not only to adults, but also to children, who are not capable of being taught, since they have not the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Therefore it is absurd to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechize</a> them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechized</a>, confesses his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now a child cannot confess its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by itself, nor can anyone else in its stead; both because no one can bind another to do anything; and because one cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether the child, having come to the <a href="../cathen/01209a.htm">right age</a>, will give its assent to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> should not precede <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus</a> says (De Instit. Cleric. i): "Before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be prepared by <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, in order that the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> may receive the rudiments of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 70, Article 1), <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the Sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>: since it is a profession of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>. Now in order that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receive the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he must be instructed therein, according to <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse14">Romans 10:14</a>: "How shall they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him, of Whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?" And therefore it is fitting that <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> should precede <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Hence when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> bade His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, He made teaching to precede <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, saying: "Go ye . . . and teach all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unto which a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is regenerated, presupposes the life of the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is capable of receiving instruction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Mother Church</a>, as stated above (69, 6, ad 3), lends children another's feet that they may come, and another's heart that they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, so, too, she lends them another's ears, that they may hear, and another's mind, that through others they may be taught. And therefore, as they are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, on the same grounds they are to be instructed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who answers in the child's stead: "I do <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>," does not foretell that the child will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> when it comes to the <a href="../cathen/01209a.htm">right age</a>, else he would say: "He will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>"; but in the child's stead he professes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is communicated to that child, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is bestowed on it, and to which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he is bound by another. For there is nothing unfitting in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> being bound by another in things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. In like manner the sponsor, in answering for the child, promises to use his endeavors that the child may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. This, however, would not be sufficient in the case of adults having the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether exorcism should precede Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that exorcism should not precede <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For exorcism is ordained against energumens or those who are possessed. But not all are such like. Therefore exorcism should not precede <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, so long as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has power over him, according to <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John 8:34</a>: "Whosoever committeth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore men should not be exorcized before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Holy water was introduced in order to ward off the power of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Therefore exorcism was not needed as a further remedy.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Celestine says (Epist. ad Episcop. Galliae): "Whether children or young people approach the sacrament of regeneration, they should not come to the fount of life before the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> spirit has been expelled from them by the exorcisms and breathings of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whoever purposes to do a work wisely, first removes the obstacles to his work; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/jer004.htm#verse3">Jeremiah 4:3</a>): "Break up anew your fallow ground and sow not upon thorns." Now the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the enemy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquires by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; and he has a certain power over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the very fact that the latter is subject to original, or even actual, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently it is fitting that before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> should be cast out by exorcisms, lest they impede <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Which expulsion is signified by the (<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>) breathing (upon the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>); while the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, with the imposition of hands, bars the way against the return of him who was cast out. Then the salt which is put in the mouth, and the anointing of the nose and ears with spittle, signify the receiving of doctrine, as to the ears; consent thereto as to the nose; and confession thereof, as to the mouth. And the anointing with oil signifies <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ability to fight against the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The energumens are so-called from "laboring inwardly" under the outward operation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And though not all that approach <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> are troubled by him in their bodies, yet all who are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are subject to the power of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, at least on account of the guilt of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in so far as he hinders <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from obtaining <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, is expelled from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the baptismal ablution; but in so far as he hinders <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, his power is cast out by the exorcisms.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Holy water is used against the assaults of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> from without. But exorcisms are directed against those assaults of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> which are from within. hence those who are exorcized are called energumens, as it were "laboring inwardly."

<p>Or we may say that just as Penance is given as a further remedy against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not repeated; so Holy Water is given as a further remedy against the assaults of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, because the baptismal exorcisms are not given a second time.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether what is done in the exorcism effects anything, or is a mere sign?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that what is done in the exorcism does not effect anything, but is a mere sign. For if a child die after the exorcisms, before being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, it is not saved. But the effects of what is done in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are ordained to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse16">Mark 16:16</a>): "He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall be saved." Therefore what is done in the exorcism effects nothing, but is a mere sign.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing is required for a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, but that it should be a sign and a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as stated above (Question 62, Article 1). If, therefore, the things done in the exorcism effect anything, it seems that each of them is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the exorcism is ordained to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, so if anything be effected in the exorcism, it is ordained to the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But disposition must needs precede the perfect form: because form is not received save into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> already disposed. It would follow, therefore, that none could obtain the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> unless he were previously exorcized; which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore what is done in the exorcisms has no effect.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as some things are done in the exorcism before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, so are some things done after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; for instance, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> anoints the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> on the top of the head. But what is done after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> seems to have no effect; for, if it had, the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> would be imperfect. Therefore neither have those things an effect, which are done in exorcism before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Symbolo I): "Little children are breathed upon and exorcized, in order to expel from them the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> hostile power, which deceived <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does nothing in vain. Therefore the effect of these breathings is that the power of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> is expelled.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some say that the things done in the exorcism have no effect, but are mere signs. But this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; since in exorcizing, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> uses words of command to cast out the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power, for instance, when she says: "Therefore, <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">accursed</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, go out from him," etc.

<p>Therefore we must say that they have some effect, but, other than that of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> gives <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unto the full remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But those things that are done in the exorcism remove the twofold impediment against the reception of saving <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Of these, one is the outward impediment, so far as the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> strive to hinder <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And this impediment is removed by the breathings, whereby the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon's</a> power is cast out, as appears from the passage quoted from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, i.e. as to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> not placing obstacles against the reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon's</a> power over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> remains as to the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the debt of punishment, until <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be washed away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. And in this sense <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says (Epist. lxxvi): "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> power remains until the pouring of the saving water: but in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> he loses it all."

<p>The other impediment is within, forasmuch as, from having contracted <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> sense is closed to the perception of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus</a> says (De Instit. Cleric. i) that "by means of the typifying spittle and the touch of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the Divine wisdom and power brings <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>, that his nostrils being opened he may perceive the odor of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that his ears be opened to hear the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that his senses be opened in his inmost heart to respond."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> What is done in the exorcism does not take away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is punished after death; but only the <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> against his receiving the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Wherefore exorcism avails a man nothing after death if he has not been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p>Praepositivus, however, says that children who die after being exorcized but before being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are subjected to lesser darkness. But this does not seem to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: because that darkness consists in privation of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, which cannot be greater or lesser.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to produce its principal effect, which is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that remits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or supplies some defect in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But those things that are done in the exorcism do not effect this; they merely remove these <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a>. Consequently, they are not <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> but <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The disposition that suffices for receiving the baptismal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, either of the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, if it be an adult, or of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if it be a child. But these things that are done in the exorcism, are directed to the removal of the <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a>. And therefore one may receive the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> without them.

<p>Yet they are not to be omitted save in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. And then, if the danger pass, they should be supplied, that uniformity in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> may be observed. Nor are they supplied to no purpose after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: because, just as the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> may be hindered before it is received, so can it be hindered after it has been received.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Of those things that are done after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> in respect of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, something is done which is not a mere sign, but produces an effect, for instance, the anointing on the top of the head, the effect of which is the preservation of baptismal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And there is something which has no effect, but is a mere sign, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are given a white garment to signify the newness of life.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it belongs to a priest to catechize and exorcize the person to be baptized?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it does not belong to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to catechize and exorcize the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For it belongs to the office of ministers to operate on the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. v). But catechumens who are instructed by catechism, and "energumens" who are cleansed by exorcism, are counted among the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says in the same place. Therefore to catechize and to exorcize do not belong to the office of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but rather to that of the ministers.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, catechumens are instructed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> which is read in the church by ministers: for just as the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is recited by the Readers, so the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is read by the Deacons and Subdeacons. And thus it belongs to the ministers to catechize. In like manner it belongs, seemingly, to the ministers to exorcize. For <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Epist. ad Ludifred.): "The <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a> should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the exorcisms by heart, and impose his hands on the energumens and catechumens during the exorcism." Therefore it belongs not to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office to catechize and exorcize.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "to catechize" is the same as "to teach," and this is the same as "to perfect." Now this belongs to the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. v). Therefore it does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Nicolas I says: "The catechizing of those who are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> can be undertaken by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> attached to each church." And <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxix super Ezech.): "When <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> place their hands on believers for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of exorcism, what else do they but cast out the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a>?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The minister compared to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, is as a secondary and instrumental agent to the principal agent: as is implied in the very word "minister." Now the secondary agent does nothing without the principal agent in operating. And the more mighty the operation, so much the mightier instruments does the principal agent require. But the operation of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in conferring the sacrament itself is mightier than in those things that are preparatory to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And so the highest ministers who are called <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> co-operate with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in bestowing the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> themselves: for <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Epist. ad Ludifred.) that "it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to assist the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in all things that are done in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, to wit, in the Chrism, in the Paten and Chalice"; while the inferior ministers assist the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in those things which are preparatory to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: the readers, for instance, in catechizing; the exorcists in exorcizing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The minister's operation in regard to the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> is ministerial and, as it were, instrumental, but the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> is principal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To readers and exorcists belongs the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of catechizing and exorcizing, not, indeed, principally, but as ministers of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in these things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Instruction is manifold. one leads to the embracing of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>; and is ascribed by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (Eccl. Hier. ii) and can be undertaken by any preacher, or even by any believer. Another is that by which a man is taught the rudiments of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and how to comport himself in receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: this belongs secondarily to the ministers, primarily to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. A third is instruction in the mode of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life: and this belongs to the sponsors. A fourth is the instruction in the profound mysteries of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and on the perfection of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life: this belongs to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> "ex officio," in virtue of their office.
