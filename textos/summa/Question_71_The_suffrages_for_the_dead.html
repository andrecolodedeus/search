<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the suffrages of one person can profit others?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the suffrages of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot profit others. For it is written (<a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse8">Galatians 6:8</a>): "What things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap." Now if one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> reaped fruit from the suffrages of another, he would reap from another's sowing. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> receives no fruit from the suffrages of others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that each one should receive according to his <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, wherefore the psalm (<a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse13">Psalm 61:13</a>) says: "Thou wilt render to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to his works." Now it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to fail. Therefore it is impossible for one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be assisted by the works of another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a work is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> on the same count as it is praiseworthy, namely inasmuch as it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Now one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not praised for the work of another. Therefore neither can the work of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> and fruitful for another.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it belongs to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to repay <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the same way as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is punished for the evildoings of another; indeed, according to <a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse4">Ezekiel 18:4</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a>, the same shall die." Therefore neither does one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> profit by another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse63">Psalm 118:63</a>): "I am a partaker with all them that fear Thee," etc.

<p>Further, all the faithful united together by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are members of the one body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now one member is assisted by another. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be assisted by the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> our actions can avail for two purposes. First, for acquiring a certain state; thus by a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> work a man obtains the state of bliss. Secondly, for something consequent upon a state; thus by some work a man <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward, or a rebate of punishment. And for both these purposes our actions may avail in two ways: first, by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; secondly, by way of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: the difference being that <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> relies on <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> on mercy; since he who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> obtains his petition from the mere liberality of the one he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>. Accordingly we must say that the work of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> nowise can avail another for acquiring a state by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, so that, to wit, a man be able to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> by the works which I do, because the share of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is awarded according to the measure of the recipient, and each one is disposed by his own and not by another's actions--disposed, that is to say, by being worthy of reward. By way of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, however, the work of one may profit another while he is a wayfarer, even for acquiring a state; for instance, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may obtain the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for another [Cf. I-II, 114, 6]: and since the impetration of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> depends on the liberality of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whom we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, it may extend to whatever is ordinately subject to the Divine power. On the other hand, as regards that which is consequent upon or accessory to a state, the work of one may avail another, not only by way of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> but even by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>: and this happens in two ways. First, on account of their communion in the root of the work, which root is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> works. Wherefore all who are united together by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> acquire some benefit from one another's works, albeit according to the measure of each one's state, since even in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> each one will rejoice in the goods of others. Hence it is that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of saints</a> is laid down as an <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a>. Secondly, through the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the doer who does certain works specially for the purpose that they may profit such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: so that those works become somewhat the works of those for whom they are done, as though they were bestowed on them by the doer. Wherefore they can avail them either for the fulfillment of satisfaction or for some similar purpose that does not change their state.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This reaping is the receiving of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse36">John 4:36</a>, "And he that reapeth . . . gathereth fruit unto life everlasting." Now a share of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> is not given to a man save for his own works, for although we may impetrate for another that he obtain life, this never happens except by means of his own works, when namely, at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of one, another is given the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The work that is done for another becomes his for whom it is done: and in like manner the work done by a man who is one with me is somewhat mine. Hence it is not contrary to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> if a man receives the fruit of the works done by a man who is one with him in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, or of works done for him. This also happens according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, so that the satisfaction offered by one is accepted in lieu of another's.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Praise is not given to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> save according to his relation to an act, wherefore praise is "in relation to something" (Ethic. i, 12). And since no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made or shown to be well- or ill-disposed to something by another's <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, it follows that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is praised for another's <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> save <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> in so far as he is somewhat the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of those <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, by giving counsel, assistance, inducement, or by any other means. on the other hand, a work is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, not only by reason of his disposition, but also in view of something consequent upon his disposition or state, as evidenced by what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It is directly contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to take away from a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> that which is his due: but to give a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> what is not his due is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but surpasses the bounds of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, for it is liberality. Now a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot be hurt by the ills of another, unless he be deprived of something of his own. Consequently it is not becoming that one should be punished for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as it is that one should acquire some advantage from <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of another.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the dead can be assisted by the works of the living?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the dead cannot be assisted by the works of the living. First, because the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>): "We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done." Therefore nothing can accrue to a man from the works of others, which are done after his death and when he is no longer in the body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, this also seems to follow from the words of <a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse13">Apocalypse 14:13</a>, "Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord . . . for their works follow them."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs only to one who is on the way to advance on account of some <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Now after death men are no longer wayfarers, because to them the words of <a href="../bible/job019.htm#verse8">Job 19:8</a>, refer: "He hath hedged in my path round about, and I cannot pass." Therefore the dead cannot be assisted by a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> suffrages.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no one is assisted by the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> of another, unless there be some community of life between them. Now there is no community between the dead and the living, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 11). Therefore the suffrages of the living do not profit the dead.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> are the words of <a href="../bible/2ma012.htm#verse46">2 Maccabees 12:46</a>: "It is . . . a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and wholesome thought to <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">pray for the dead</a> that they may be loosed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." But this would not be profitable unless it were a help to them. Therefore the suffrages of the living profit the dead.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Cure pro Mort. i): "Of no small weight is the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> whereby she clearly approves of the custom whereby a commendation of the dead has a place in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> pour forth to the Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at His altar." This custom was established by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves according to the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> in a sermon on suffrages for the dead [De his qui in fide dormierunt, 3, where he expresses himself thus: "Realizing the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Mysteries the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Saviour and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">His holy apostles</a> sanctioned a commemoration of those who had died in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, being made in the awe-inspiring and life-giving Mysteries." This is also confirmed by the authority of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Hier. Eccl.), where he mentions the rite of the Early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">praying for the dead</a>, and, moreover, asserts that the suffrages of the living profit the dead. Therefore we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>, which is the bond uniting the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, extends not only to the living, but also to the dead who die in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is the life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the life of the body, has no end: "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> never falleth away" (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>). Moreover, the dead live in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of the living: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the living can be directed to them. Hence the suffrages of the living profit the dead in two ways even as they profit the living, both on account of the bond of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and on account of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> being directed to them. Nevertheless, we must not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the suffrages of the living profit them so as to change their state from unhappiness to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> or "vice versa"; but they avail for the diminution of punishment or something of the kind that involves no change in the state of the dead.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Man while living in the body <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> that such things should avail him after death. Wherefore if he is assisted thereby after this life, this is, nevertheless, the result of the things he has done in the body. Or we may reply, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">John Damascene</a>, in the sermon quoted above, that these words refer to the retribution which will be made at the final judgment, of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal glory</a> or <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal unhappiness</a>: for then each one will receive only according as he himself has done in the body. Meanwhile, however, he can be assisted by the suffrages of the living.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The words quoted refer expressly to the sequel of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> retribution as is clear from the opening words: "Blessed are the dead," etc. Or we may reply that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done on their behalf are somewhat their own, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although, strictly speaking, after death <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are not in the state of the way, yet in a certain respect they are still on the way, in so far as they are delayed awhile in their advance towards their final award. Wherefore, strictly speaking, their way is hedged in round about, so that they can no more be changed by any works in respect of the state of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> or unhappiness. Yet their way is not so hedged around that they cannot be helped by others in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of their being delayed from receiving their final award, because in this respect they are still wayfarers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the communion of civic <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> whereof the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks, is impossible between the dead and the living, because the dead are outside civic life, the communication of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life is possible between them, for that life is founded on <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom the spirits of the dead live.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether suffrages performed by sinners profit the dead?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that suffrages performed by sinners do not profit the dead. For, according to <a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse31">John 9:31</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth not hear sinners." Now if their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were to profit those for whom they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, they would be heard by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the suffrages performed by them do not profit the dead.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastoral i, 11) that "when an offensive <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is sent to intercede, the wrath of the angered party is provoked to harsher measures." Now every sinner is offensive to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not inclined to mercy by the suffrages of sinners, and consequently their suffrages are of no avail.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> would seem to be more fruitful to the doer than to another. But a sinner <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> naught for himself by his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Much less, therefore, can he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for another.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> work must be a living work, that is to say, informed by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now works done by sinners are dead. Therefore the dead for whom they are done cannot be assisted thereby.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain about another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whether the latter be in a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. If, therefore, only those suffrages were profitable that are done by those who are in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, a man could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of whom to ask suffrages for his dead, and consequently many would be deterred from obtaining suffrages.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion cix), as quoted in the text (Sent. iv, D, 45), the dead are assisted by suffrages according as while living they <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> to be assisted after death. Therefore the worth of suffrages is measured according to the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom they are performed. Therefore it would appear that it differs not whether they be performed by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things may be considered in the suffrages performed by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. First, the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> done, for instance the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the altar</a>. And since our <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> have their efficacy from themselves independently of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> of the doer, and are equally efficacious by whomsoever they are performed, in this respect the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> profit the departed. Secondly, we may consider the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> of the doer, and then we must draw a distinction; because the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> of a sinner who offers suffrage may be considered--in one way in so far as it is his own <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, and thus it can nowise be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> either to himself or to another; in another way in so far as it is another's <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, and this happens in two ways. First, when the sinner, offering suffrages, represents the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for instance a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> when he performs the burial service in church. And since one in whose name or in whose stead a thing is done is understood to do it himself as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> asserts (Coel. Hier. xiii), it follows that the suffrages of that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, albeit a sinner, profit the departed. Secondly, when he acts as the instrument of another: for the work of the instrument belongs more to the principal agent. Wherefore, although he who acts as the instrument of another be not in a state of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, his act may be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> on account of the principal agent: for instance if a servant being in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> do any work of mercy at the command of his master who has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence, if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> dying in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> command suffrages to be offered for him, or if some other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> having <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> prescribe them, those suffrages avail for the departed, even though the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by whom they are performed be in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nevertheless they would avail more if those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because then those works would be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> on two counts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> offered by a sinner is sometimes not his but another's, and consequently in this respect is worthy to be heard by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes hears sinners, when, to wit, they ask for something acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dispenses His goods not only to the righteous but also to sinners (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew 5:45</a>), not indeed on account of their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, but of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> kindness. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse31">John 9:31</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth not hear sinners," says that "he speaks as one unanointed and as not seeing clearly."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the sinner's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not acceptable in so far as he is offensive, it may be acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on account of another in whose stead or at whose command he offers the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The reason why the sinner who performs these suffrages gains nothing thereby is because he is not capable of profiting by reason of his own indisposition. Nevertheless, as stated above, it may in some way profit another, who is disposed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the sinner's <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is not living in so far as it is his own, it may be living in so far as it is another's, as stated above.

<p>Since, however, the arguments in the contrary sense would seem to show that it matters not whether one obtain suffrages from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, we must reply to them also.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Although one cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain about another whether he be in the state of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, one may infer it with probability from what one sees outwardly of a man: for a tree is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its fruit (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse16">Matthew 7:16</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> In order that suffrage avail another, it is requisite that the one for whom it is performed be capable of availing by it: and a man has become capable of this by his own works which he did in his life-time. This is what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> means to say. Nevertheless, those works must be such that they can profit him, and this depends not on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom the suffrage is performed, but rather on the one who offers the suffrages whether by performing them or by commanding them.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether suffrages offered by the living for the dead profit those who offer them?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that suffrages offered by the living for the dead do not profit those who offer them. For according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> a man is not <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from his own debt if he pay a debt for another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore a man is not <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from his own debt for the reason that by offering suffrages he has paid the debt of the one for whom he offered them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever a man does, he should do it as best he can. Now it is better to assist two than one. Therefore if one who by suffrages has paid the debt of a dead <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is freed from his own debt, it would seem that one ought never to satisfy for oneself, but always for another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the satisfaction of one who satisfies for another profits him equally with the one for whom he satisfies, it will likewise equally profit a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> if he satisfy for him at the same time, and likewise a fourth and so on. Therefore he might satisfy for all by one work of satisfaction; which is absurd.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa034.htm#verse13">Psalm 34:13</a>): "My <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall be turned into my bosom." Therefore, in like manner, suffrages that are offered for others profit those who satisfy.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says in the sermon "On those who fell asleep in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: Just as when about to anoint a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with the ointment or other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil, first of all he, " namely the anointer, "shares in the anointing and thus proceeds to anoint the patient, so whoever strives for his neighbor's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> first of all profits himself and afterwards his neighbor." And thus the question at issue is answered.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The work of suffrage that is done for another may be considered in two ways. First, as expiating punishment by way of compensation which is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of satisfaction: and in this way the work of suffrage that is counted as belonging to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom it is done, while absolving him from the debt of punishment, does not <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> the performer from his own debt of punishment, because in this compensation we have to consider the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and this work of satisfaction can be equal to the one debt without being equal to the other, for the debts of two sinners require a greater satisfaction than the debt of one. Secondly, it may be considered as meriting <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, and this it has as proceeding from its root, which is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: and in this way it profits not only the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom it is done, but also and still more the doer.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections: for the first considered the work of suffrage as a work of satisfaction, while the others consider it as <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether suffrages profit those who are in hell?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that suffrages profit those who are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/2ma012.htm#verse40">2 Maccabees 12:40</a>): "They found under the coats of the slain some of the donaries of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> . . . which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> forbiddeth to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>," and yet we read further on (<a href="../bible/2ma012.htm#verse43">2 Maccabees 12:43</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> "sent twelve thousand drachms of silver to Jerusalem . . . to be offered for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the dead." Now it is clear that they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> mortally through acting against the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, and consequently that they died in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and were taken to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Therefore suffrages profit those who are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the text (Sent. iv, D, 45) quotes the saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion cx) that "those whom suffrages profit gain either entire forgiveness, or at least an abatement of their damnation." Now only those who are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> are said to be damned. Therefore suffrages profit even those who are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier.): "If here the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the righteous avail those who are alive, how much more do they, after death, profit those alone who are worthy of their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>?" Hence we may gather that suffrages are more profitable to the dead than to the living. Now they profit the living even though they be in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> daily for sinners that they be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore suffrages avail also for the dead who are in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in the Lives of the Fathers (iii, 172; vi, 3) we read, and the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> relates in his sermon [De his qui in fide dormierunt] that Macarius discovered the skull of a dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the road, and that after <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> he asked whose head it was, and the head replied that it had belonged to a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who was condemned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; and yet he confessed that he and others were assisted by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Macarius. Therefore the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> profit even those who are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> in the same sermon relates that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, while <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, heard a voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> saying to him: "I have heard thy voice, and I pardon <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>": and of this fact the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> adds in the same sermon, "the whole East and West are <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>." Yet it is clear that <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> was in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, since "he put many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> to a cruel death" [De his qui fide dormierunt]. Therefore the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> avail even for those who are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. vii): "The <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> not for the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, because by so doing he would act counter to the Divine order," and consequently he says (Eccl. Hier. vii) that "he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> not that sinners be forgiven, because his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for them would not be heard." Therefore suffrages avail not those who are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxiv, 19): "There is the same reason for not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> then" (namely after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a>) "for men condemned to the everlasting fire, as there is now for not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are sentenced to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, and for this reason the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> not for dead unbelieving and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, because, forsooth, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> them to be already condemned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, they shrink from pleading for them by the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> before they are summoned to the presence of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">just Judge</a>."

<p>Further, the text (Sent. iv, D, 45) quotes the words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Verb. A post. Serm. xxxii): "If a man depart this life without the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and its <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, in vain do his friends have recourse to such like acts of kindness." Now all the damned come under that head. Therefore suffrages profit them not.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There have been three opinions about the damned. For some have said that a twofold distinction must be made in this matter. First, as to time; for they said that after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a> no one in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> will be assisted by any suffrage, but that before the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a> some are assisted by the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Secondly, they made a distinction among those who are detained in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Some of these, they said, are very bad, those namely who have died without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and these, since they were not of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, neither "by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> nor, by name" [Cf. Oratio ad Vesperas, Fer. ii, post Dom. Pass.] can the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> avail; while others are not very bad, those namely who belonged to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as actual members, who had the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, frequented the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and performed works generically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and for these the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to avail. Yet they were confronted with a difficulty which troubled them, for it would seem to follow from this (since the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is finite in intensity although <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in duration) that a multiplicity of suffrages would take away that punishment altogether, which is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Peri Archon. i; cf. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, Moral. xxxiv): and consequently endeavored in various ways to avoid this difficulty.

<p>Praepositivus [Gilbert Prevostin, Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">See of Paris</a>, A.D. 1205-9 said that suffrages for the damned can be so multiplied that they are entirely freed from punishment, not absolutely as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> maintained, but for a time, namely till the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a>: for their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will be reunited to their bodies, and will be cast back into the punishments of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> without hope of pardon. But this opinion seems incompatible with <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, which leaves nothing inordinate in the world. For guilt cannot be restored to order save by punishment: wherefore it is impossible for punishment to cease, unless first of all guilt be expiated: so that, as guilt remains for ever in the damned, their punishment will nowise be interrupted.

<p>For this reason the followers of Gilbert de la Porree devised another explanation. These said that the process in the diminution of punishments by suffrages is as the process in dividing a line, which though finite, is indefinitely divisible, and is never destroyed by division, if it be diminished not by equal but by proportionate <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantities</a>, for instance if we begin by taking away a quarter of the whole, and secondly, a quarter of that quarter, and then a quarter of this second quarter, and so on indefinitely. In like manner, they say by the first suffrage a certain proportion of the punishment is taken away, and by the second an equally proportionate part of the remainder. But this explanation is in many ways defective. First, because it seems that indefinite division which is applicable to continuous <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> cannot be transferred to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>: secondly, because there is no reason why the second suffrage, if it be of equal worth, should diminish the punishment less than the first: thirdly, because punishment cannot be diminished unless guilt be diminished, even as it cannot be done away unless the guilt be done away: fourthly, because in the division of a line we come at length to something which is not sensible, for a sensible body is not indefinitely divisible: and thus it would follow that after many suffrages the remaining punishment would be so little as not to be felt, and thus would no longer be a punishment.

<p>Hence others found another explanation. For Antissiodorensis [<a href="../cathen/15631d.htm">William of Auxerre</a>, Archdeacon of Beauvais] (Sent. iv, Tract. 14) said that suffrages profit the damned not by diminishing or interrupting their punishment, but by fortifying the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> punished: even as a man who is carrying a heavy load might bathe his face in water, for thus he would be enabled to carry it better, and yet his load would be none the lighter. But this again is impossible, because according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. ix) a man suffers more or less from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> fire according as his guilt deserves; and consequently some suffer more, some less, from the same fire. wherefore since the guilt of the damned remains unchanged, it cannot be that he suffers less punishment. Moreover, the aforesaid opinion is presumptuous, as being in opposition to the statements of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, and groundless as being based on no authority. It is also unreasonable. First, because the damned in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> are cut off from the bond of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in virtue of which the departed are in touch with the works of the living. Secondly, because they have entirely come to the end of life, and have received the final award for their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. For the remaining punishment or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body does not make them to be wayfarers, since <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> and radically resides in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. It is the same with the unhappiness of the damned, wherefore their punishment cannot be diminished as neither can the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> be increased as to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward.

<p>However, we may admit, in a certain measure, the manner in which, according to some, suffrages profit the damned, if it be said that they profit neither by diminishing nor interrupting their punishment, nor again by diminishing their sense of punishment, but by withdrawing from the damned some <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of grief, which <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> they might have if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> themselves to be so outcast as to be a care to no one; and this matter of grief is withdrawn from them when suffrages are offered for them. Yet even this is impossible according to the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, because as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Cura pro Mort. xiii)--and this applies especially to the damned--"the spirits of the departed are where they see nothing of what men do or of what happens to them in this life," and consequently they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not when suffrages are offered for them, unless this relief be granted from above to some of the damned in spite of the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. This, however, is a matter of great uncertainty; wherefore it is safer to say simply that suffrages profit not the damned, nor does the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> intend to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them, as appears from the authors quoted above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The donaries to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> were not found on those dead so that they might be taken as a sign that they were carried off in reverence to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: but they took them as conquerors because they were due to them by right of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. They <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, however, venially by <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: and consequently they were not damned in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and thus suffrages could profit them. or we may say, according to some, that in the midst of fighting, seeing they were in danger, they repented of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse34">Psalm 77:34</a>, "When He slew them, then they sought Him": and this is a probable opinion. Wherefore the offering was made for them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In these words damnation is taken in a broad sense for any kind of punishment, so as to include also the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> which is sometimes entirely expiated by suffrages, and sometimes not entirety, but diminished.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">Suffrage for a dead person</a> is more acceptable than for a living <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as regards his being in greater want, since he cannot help himself as a living <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can. But a living <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is better off in that he can be taken from the state of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, which cannot be said of the dead. Hence there is not the same reason for <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">praying for the dead</a> as for the living.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This assistance did not consist in a diminishment of their punishment, but in this alone (as stated in the same place) that when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> they were permitted to see one another, and in this they had a certain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, not real but <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a>, in the fulfillment of their desire. Even so the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are said to rejoice when they draw men into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although this nowise diminishes their punishment, as neither is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> diminished by the fact that they take pity on our ills.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Concerning the incident of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> it may be supposed with probability that he was recalled to life at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of blessed Gregory, and thus obtained the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby he received the pardon of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and in consequence was freed from punishment. The same applies to all those who were <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> raised from the dead, many of whom were evidently idolaters and damned. For we must needs say likewise of all such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that they were consigned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, not finally, but as was actually due to their own <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> according to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and that according to higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, in view of which it was foreseen that they would be recalled to life, they were to be disposed of otherwise.

<p>Or we may say with some that <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not simply freed from the debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, but that his punishment was suspended for a time, that is, until the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a>. Nor does it follow that this is the general result of suffrages, because things happen differently in accordance with the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> from that which is permitted in particular cases and by privilege. Even so the bounds of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs differ from those of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the Divine power as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Cura pro Mort. xvi).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether suffrages profit those who are in purgatory?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that suffrages do not profit even those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Now "there is no redemption in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>" [<a href="../cathen/11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a>, Resp. vii], and it is written (<a href="../bible/psa006.htm#verse6">Psalm 6:6</a>), "Who shall confess to Thee in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>?" Therefore suffrages do not profit those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> is finite. Therefore if some of the punishment is abated by suffrages, it would be possible to have such a great number of suffrages, that the punishment would be entirely remitted, and consequently the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entirely unpunished: and this would seem incompatible with Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> in order that they may be purified there, and being pure may come to the kingdom. Now nothing can be purified, unless something be done to it. Therefore suffrages offered by the living do not diminish the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if suffrages availed those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, those especially would seem to avail them which are offered at their behest. Yet these do not always avail: for instance, if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> before dying were to provide for so many suffrages to be offered for him that if they were offered they would suffice for the remission of his entire punishment. Now supposing these suffrages to be delayed until he is released from punishment, they will profit him nothing. For it cannot be said that they profit him before they are discharged; and after they are fulfilled, he no longer needs them, since he is already released. Therefore suffrages do not avail those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As quoted in the text (Sent. iv, D, 45), <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion cx): "Suffrages profit those who are not very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or not very bad." Now such are those who are detained in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. vii) that the "<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godlike</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the departed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for those who lived a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, and yet contracted certain stains through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty." Now such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are detained in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> is intended to supplement the satisfaction which was not fully completed in the body. Consequently, since, as stated above (1,2; 13, 2), the works of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can avail for another's satisfaction, whether the latter be living or dead, the suffrages of the living, without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, profit those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words quoted refer to those who are in the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the damned, where there is no redemption for those who are finally consigned to that punishment. We may also reply with <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (Serm.: De his qui in fide dormierunt) that such statements are to be explained with reference to the lower <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, that is according to the demands of the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of those who are consigned to those punishments. But according to the Divine mercy which transcends <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, it happens otherwise through the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the righteous, than is implied by the expressions quoted in the aforesaid authorities. Now "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> changes His sentence but not his counsel," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xx): wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (Serm.: De his qui in fide dormierunt) quotes as instances of this the Ninevites, <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> and <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, in whom it is apparent that the sentence pronounced against them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was commuted by the Divine mercy [Cf. I, 19, 7, ad 2].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not unreasonable that the punishment of those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> be entirely done away by the multiplicity of suffrages. But it does not follow that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> remain unpunished, because the punishment of one undertaken in lieu of another is credited to that other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The purifying of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> is nothing else than the expiation of the guilt that hinders it from obtaining <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And since, as stated above (Question 13, Article 2), the guilt of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can be expiated by the punishment which another undergoes in his stead, it is not unreasonable that one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> be purified by another satisfying for him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Suffrages avail on two counts, namely the action of the agent ["Ex opere operante" and "ex opere operato"] and the action done. By action done I mean not only the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but the effect incidental to that action--thus from the giving of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> there follow the relief of the poor and their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the deceased. In like manner the action of the agent may be considered in relation either to the principal agent or to the executor. I say, then, that the dying <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as soon as he provides for certain suffrages to be offered for him, receives the full meed of those suffrages, even before they are discharged, as regards the efficacy of the suffrages that results from the action as proceeding from the principal agent. But as regards the efficacy of the suffrages arising from the action done or from the action as proceeding from the executor, he does not receive the fruit before the suffrages are discharged. And if, before this, he happens to be released from his punishment, he will in this respect be deprived of the fruit of the suffrages, and this will fall back upon those by whose fault he was then defrauded. For it is not unreasonable that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> be defrauded in temporal matters by another's fault--and the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> is temporal--although as regards the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> retribution none can be defrauded save by his own fault.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether suffrages avail the children who are in limbo?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that suffrages avail the children who are in <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>. For they are not detained there except for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it is most becoming that they should be assisted by the suffrages of others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the text (Sent. iv, D, 45) the words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion cx) are quoted: "The suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> obtain forgiveness for those who are not very bad." Now children are not reckoned among those who are very bad, since their punishment is very light. Therefore the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> avail them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The text (Sent. iv, D, 45) quotes <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> as saying (Serm. xxxii, De Verb Ap.) that "suffrages avail not those who have departed hence without the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that works by love." Now the children departed thus. Therefore suffrages avail them not.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Unbaptized children are not detained in <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> save because they lack the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>. Hence, since the state of the dead cannot be changed by the works of the living, especially as regards the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward or punishment, the suffrages of the living cannot profit the children in <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is such that one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can be assisted by another on its account, nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the children in <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> are in such a state that they cannot be assisted, because after this life there is no time for obtaining <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking of those who are not very bad, but have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. This is clear from what precedes: "Since these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">of the altar</a> or of any <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> whatsoever are offered for those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>," etc.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether suffrages profit the saints in heaven?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in some way suffrages profit the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; on account of the words of the <a href="../cathen/04103a.htm">Collect</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> [Postcommunion, Feast of St. Andrew, Apostle]: "Even as they" (i.e. the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>) "avail thy <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, so may they profit us unto healing." Now foremost among all suffrages is the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the altar</a>. Therefore suffrages profit the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> what they signify. Now the third part of the host, that namely which is dropped into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, signifies those who lead a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> profit those who are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> rejoice in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> not only in their own goods, but also in the goods of others: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse10">Luke 15:10</a>): "There is [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'shall be'] <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> upon one sinner doing penance." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> increases on account of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works of the living: and consequently our suffrages also profit them.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (Serm.: De his qui in fide dormierunt) quoting the words of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>: "For if the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>," he says, "burn the dead together with what has belonged to them, how much more shouldst thou, a believer, send forth a believer together with what has belonged to him, not that they also may be brought to ashes like him, but that thou mayest surround him with greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by so doing; and if he be a sinner who has died, that thou mayest loose him from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and if he be righteous, that thou mayest add to his meed and reward!" And thus the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As quoted in the text (Sent. iv, D, 15), <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb Ap., Serm. xvii): "It is insulting to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in church, since we ought to commend ourselves to his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>."

<p>Further, to be assisted belongs to one who is in need. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are without any need whatever. Therefore they are not assisted by the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Suffrage by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> implies the giving of some assistance, which does not apply to one who suffers no default: since no one is competent to be assisted except he who is in need. Hence, as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are free from all need, being inebriated with the plenty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> house (<a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse10">Psalm 35:10</a>), they are not competent to be assisted by suffrages.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Such like expressions do not mean that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> receive an increase of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in themselves through our observing their feasts, but that we profit thereby in celebrating their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with greater <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>. Thus, through our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> or praising <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and through His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> thus increasing some what in us, there accrues something, not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> what thy signify, they do not produce this effect in respect of everything that they signify: else, since they signify <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they would produce something in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (which is absurd). But they produce their effect on the recipient of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in virtue of that which is signified by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Thus it does not follow that the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered for the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed profit the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but that by the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> which we commemorate, or which are signified in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, they profit others for whom they are offered.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> rejoice in all our goods, it does not follow, that if our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joys</a> be increased their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is also increased formally, but only materially, because every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> is increased formally in respect of the formal aspect of its object. Now the formal aspect of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>' <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> what they rejoice in, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, in Whom they cannot rejoice more and less, for otherwise their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, consisting of their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, would vary. Hence from the fact that the goods are multiplied, wherein they rejoice with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the formal aspect of their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, it does not follow that their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is intensified, but that they rejoice in more things. Consequently it does not follow that they are assisted by our works.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The sense is not that an increase of meed or reward accrues to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> from the suffrages offered by a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but that this accrues to the offerer. Or we may reply that the blessed departed may derive a reward from suffrages through having, while living, provided for suffrage to be offered for himself, and this was <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> for him.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether the prayers of the Church, the sacrifice of the altar and alms profit the departed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed are not assisted only by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the altar</a> and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, or that they are not assisted by them chiefly. For punishment should compensate for punishment. Now <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is more penal than almsgiving or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> profits more as suffrage than any of the above.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> reckons <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> together with these three, as stated in the Decretals (xiii, Q. ii, Cap. 22): "The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed are released in four ways, either by the offerings of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of their friends, or the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsfolk</a>." Therefore the three mentioned above are insufficiently reckoned by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Cura pro Mort. xviii).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, especially as regards its effect. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> ought to be offered for the departed equally with or more than the Sacrament of the altar.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, this would seem to follow from the words of <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse29">1 Corinthians 15:29</a>, "If the dead rise not again at all, why are they then <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for them?" Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> avails as suffrage for the dead.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, in different Masses there is the same Sacrifice of the altar. If, therefore, sacrifice, and not the Mass, be reckoned among the suffrages, it would seem that the effect would be the same whatever Mass be said for a deceased <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, whether in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, or any other. Yet this seems contrary to the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which has appointed a special Mass for the dead.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (Serm.: De his qui in fide dormierunt) teaches that candles and oil should be offered for the dead. Therefore not only the offering of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the altar</a>, but also other offerings should be reckoned among suffrages for the dead.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The suffrages of the living profit the dead in so far as the latter are united to the living in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and in so far as the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the living is directed to the dead. Consequently those whose works are by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> best adapted to assist the dead, which pertain chiefly to the communication of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, or to the directing of one's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Now the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> belongs chiefly to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since it is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">ecclesiastical unity</a>, inasmuch as it contains Him in Whom the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is united and incorporated, namely <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is as it were the origin and bond of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Again, chief among the effects of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the work of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>: wherefore on the part of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> these two, namely the sacrifice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and almsgiving are the chief suffrages for the dead. But on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> directed to the dead the chief suffrage is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, because <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> implies relation not only to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, even as other works do, but more directly still to that which we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for. Hence these three are reckoned the principal means of succoring the dead, although we must allow that any other goods whatsoever that are done out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> for the dead are profitable to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> satisfies for another, the point to consider, in order that the effect of his satisfaction reach the other, is the thing whereby the satisfaction of one passes to another, rather than even the punishment undergone by way of satisfaction; although the punishment expiates more the guilt of the one who satisfies, in so far as it is a kind of medicine. And consequently the three aforesaid are more profitable to the departed than <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> can profit the departed by reason of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and on account of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> being directed to the departed. Nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> does not by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> contain anything pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> or to the directing of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, and these things are extrinsic thereto as it were, and for this reason <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> did not reckon, while <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> did reckon, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> among the suffrages for the dead.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, wherefore just as by generation being does not accrue save to the object generated, so <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> produces its effect only in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, as regards the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> done: and yet as regards the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> of the doer whether of the baptizer or of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, it may profit others even as other <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> works. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is the sign of <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">ecclesiastical unity</a>, wherefore by reason of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> done its effect can pass to another, which is not the case with the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> this passage may be expounded in two ways. First, thus: "If the dead rise not again, nor did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rise again, why are they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for them? i.e. for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, since they are not pardoned if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rose not again, because in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> not only <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's passion</a> but also His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> operates, for the latter is in a sense the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> resurrection." Secondly, thus: There have been some misguided <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for those who had departed this life without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, thinking that this would profit them: and according to this explanation the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking, in the above words, merely according to the opinion of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> In the office of the Mass there is not only a sacrifice but also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Hence the suffrage of the Mass contains two of the things mentioned by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Cura pro Mort. xviii), namely "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>" and "sacrifice." As regards the sacrifice offered the Mass profits equally the departed, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> it be said: and this is the principal thing done in the Mass. But as regards the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, that Mass is most profitable in which the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are appointed for this purpose. Nevertheless, this defect may be supplied by the greater devotion, either of the one who says Mass, or of the one who orders the Mass to be said, or again, by the intercession of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> whose suffrage is besought in the Mass.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> This offering of candles or oil may profit the departed in so far as they are a kind of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>: for they are given for the worship of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or for the use of the faithful.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether the indulgences of the Church profit the dead?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> granted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> profit even the dead. First, on account of the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who orders the preaching of a crusade in order that some one may gain an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for himself and for two or three and sometimes even ten <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, both of the living and of the dead. But this would amount to a deception unless they profited the dead. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> profit the dead.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is more efficacious than that of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Now personal <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> serves as a suffrage for the departed, for instance in the case of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>. Much more therefore does the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> whereon <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are founded.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> profit those who are members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> are members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, else the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would not profit them. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> profit the departed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In order that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> may avail a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, there must be a fitting <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for granting the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> [Cf. 25, 2]. Now there can be no such <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on the part of the dead, since they can do nothing that is of profit to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and it is for such a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are chiefly granted. Therefore, seemingly, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> profit not the dead.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are regulated according to the decision of the party who grants them. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> could avail the dead, it would be in the power of the party granting them to release a deceased <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> entirely from punishment: which is apparently absurd.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> may profit a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in two ways: in one way, principally; in another, secondarily. It profits principally the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who avails himself of an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, who, namely, does that for which the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is granted, for instance one who visits the shrine of some <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. Hence since the dead can do none of those things for which <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are granted, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> cannot avail them directly. However, they profit secondarily and indirectly the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom one does that which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>. This is sometimes feasible and sometimes not, according to the different forms of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>. For if the form of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> be such as this: "Whosoever does this or that shall gain so much <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>," he who does this cannot transfer the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to another, because it is not in his power to apply to a particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who dispenses the common suffrages whence <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> derive their value, as stated abovek2(27, 3, ad 2). If, however, the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> be granted in this form: "Whosoever does this or that, he, his father, or any other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> connected with him and detained in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, will gain so much <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>," an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of this kind will avail not only a living but also a deceased <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For there is no reason why the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is able to transfer the common <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, whereon <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are based, to the living and not to the dead. Nor does it follow that a prelate of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can release <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> just as he lists, since for <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> to avail there must be a fitting <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for granting them, as stated above (Question 26, Article 3).

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether the burial service profits the dead?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the burial service profits the dead. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (Serm.: De his qui in fide dormierunt) quotes <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> as saying: "Even though he who has departed in godliness be taken up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, do not hesitate to call upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to burn oil and wax at his tomb; for such things are pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and receive a great reward from Him." Now the like pertain to the burial service. Therefore the burial service profits the dead.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Cura pro mort. iii), "In olden times the funerals of just men were cared for with dutiful piety, their obsequies celebrated, their graves provided, and themselves while living charged their children touching the burial or even the translation of their bodies." But they would not have done this unless the tomb and things of this kind conferred something on the dead. Therefore the like profit the dead somewhat.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one does a work of mercy on some one's behalf unless it profit him. Now burying the dead is reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>, therefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Cura pro Mort. iii): "<a href="../cathen/14749c.htm">Tobias</a>, as attested by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, is declared to have found favor with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by burying the dead." Therefore such like burial observances profit the dead.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is unbecoming to assert that the devotion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> is fruitless. Now some, out of devotion, arrange for their burial in some religious locality. Therefore the burial service profits the dead.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more inclined to pity than to condemn. Now burial in a sacred place is hurtful to some if they be unworthy: wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. iv): "If those who are burdened with grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are buried in the church this will lead to their more severe condemnation rather than to their release." Much more, therefore, should we say that the burial service profits the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Cura pro Mort. iii): "Whatever service is done the body is no aid to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but an office of humanity."

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Cura pro Mort. iii; De Civ. Dei i): "The funereal equipment, the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the obsequies are a comfort to the living rather than a help to the dead."

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse4">Luke 12:4</a>): "Be not afraid of them who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do." Now after death the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> can be hindered from being buried, as we read of having been done to certain <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> at Lyons in Gaul (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, Eccl. Hist. v, 1). Therefore the dead take no harm if their bodies remain unburied: and consequently the burial service does not profit them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We have recourse to burial for the sake of both the living and the dead. For the sake of the living, lest their eyes be revolted by the disfigurement of the corpse, and their bodies be infected by the stench, and this as regards the body. But it profits the living also spiritually inasmuch as our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is confirmed thereby. It profits the dead in so far as one bears the dead in mind and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for them through looking on their burial place, wherefore a "monument" takes its name from remembrance, for a monument is something that recalls the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> [monens mentem], as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Civ. Dei i; De Cura pro Mort. iv). It was, however, a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that burial was profitable to the dead by procuring rest for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could not be at rest until the body was buried, which is altogether ridiculous and absurd.

<p>That, moreover, burial in a sacred place profits the dead, does not result from the action done, but rather from the action itself of the doer: when, to wit, the dead <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> himself, or another, arranges for his body to be buried in a sacred place, and commends him to the <a href="../cathen/11560c.htm">patronage</a> of some <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, by whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he is assisted, as well as to the suffrages of those who serve the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> more frequently and more specially for those who are buried in their midst. But such things as are done for the display of the obsequies are profitable to the living, as being a consolation to them; and yet they can also profit the dead, not directly but indirectly, in so far as men are aroused to pity thereby and consequently to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, or in so far as the outlay on the burial brings either assistance to the poor or adornment to the church: for it is in this sense that the burial of the dead is reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By bringing oil and candles to the tombs of the dead we profit them indirectly, either as offering them to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and as giving them to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, or as doing this in reverence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence, after the words quoted we read: "For oil and candles are a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The fathers of old arranged for the burial of their bodies, so as to show that "the bodies of the dead" are the object of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, not that there is any feeling in a dead body, but in order to confirm the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 13). Hence, also, they wished to be buried in the land of promise, where they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth and death would take place, Whose <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our rising again</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since flesh is a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> affection for his flesh, according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse29">Ephesians 5:29</a>, "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his own flesh." Hence in accordance with this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> affection a man has during life a certain solicitude for what will become of his body after death: and he would grieve if he had a presentiment that something untoward would happen to his body. Consequently those who love a man, through being conformed to the one they love in his affection for himself, treat his body with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> care. For as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 13): "If a father's garment and <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">ring</a>, and whatever such like is the more dear to those whom they leave behind the greater their affection is towards their parents, in no wise are the bodies themselves to be spurned which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> we wear in more familiar and close conjunction than anything else we put on."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Cura pro Mort. iv), the devotion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> is not fruitless when they arrange for their friends to be buried in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, since by so doing they commend their dead to the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> dead takes no harm by being buried in a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, except in so far as he rendered such a burial place unfitting for him by reason of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether suffrages offered for one deceased person profit the person for whom they are offered more than others?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that suffrages offered for one deceased <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> are not more profitable to the one for whom they are offered, than to others. For <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> light is more communicable than a material light. Now a material light, for instance of a candle, though kindled for one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> only, avails equally all those who are gathered together, though the candle be not lit for them. Therefore, since suffrages are a kind of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> light, though they be offered for one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in particular, do not avail him any more than the others who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 45), suffrages avail the dead "in so far as during this life they <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> that they might avail them afterwards" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, Enchiridion cx]. Now some <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> that suffrages might avail them more than those for whom they are offered. Therefore they profit more by those suffrages, else their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> would be rendered unavailing.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the poor have not so many suffrages given them as the rich. Therefore if the suffrages offered for certain people profit them alone, or profit them more than others, the poor would be worse off: yet this is contrary to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> saying (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse20">Luke 6:20</a>): "Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is copied from Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> pay another's debt <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> releases the latter alone. Therefore since he who offers suffrages for another pays the debt, in a sense, of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom he offers them, they profit this <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> alone.

<p>Further, just as a man by offering suffrages satisfies somewhat for a deceased <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so, too, sometimes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can satisfy for a living <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Now where one satisfies for a living <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the satisfaction counts only for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom it is offered. Therefore one also who offers suffrages profits him alone for whom he offers them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There have been two opinions on this question. Some, like Praepositivus, have said that suffrages offered for one particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> do avail chiefly, not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom they are offered, but those who are most worthy. And they instanced a candle which is lit for a rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and profits those who are with him no less than the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself, and perhaps even more, if they have keener sight. They also gave the instance of a lesson which profits the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom it is given no more than others who listen with him, but perhaps profits these others more, if they be more <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a>. And if it were pointed out to them that in this case the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ordinance in appointing certain special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is futile, they said that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> did this to excite the devotion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, who are more inclined to offer special than common suffrages, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">fervently</a> for their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsfolk</a> than for strangers.

<p>Others, on the contrary, said that suffrages avail more those for whom they are offered. Now both opinions have a certain amount of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for the value of suffrages may be gauged from two sources. For their value is derived in the first place from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which makes all goods common, and in this respect they avail more the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is more full of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, although they are not offered specially for him. In this way the value of suffrages regards more a certain inward consolation by reason of which one who is in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rejoices in the goods of another after death in respect of the diminution of punishment; for after death there is no possibility of obtaining or increasing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereas during life the works of others avail for this purpose by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. In the second place suffrages derive their value from being applied to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by one's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. In this way the satisfaction of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> counts for another, and there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that thus they avail more the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom they are offered: in fact, they avail him alone in this way, because satisfaction, properly speaking, is directed to the remission of punishment. Consequently, as regards the remission of punishment, suffrages avail chiefly the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom they are offered, and accordingly there is more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the second opinion than in the first.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Suffrages avail, after the manner of a light, in so far as they reach the dead, who thereby receive a certain amount of consolation: and this is all the greater according as they are endowed with a greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But in so far as suffrages are a satisfaction applied to another by the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the offerer, they do not resemble a light, but rather the payment of a debt: and it does not follow, if one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> debt be paid, that the debt of others is paid likewise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Such a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is conditional, for in this way they <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> that suffrages would profit them if offered for them, and this was merely to render themselves fit recipients of those suffrages. It is therefore clear that they did not directly <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the assistance of those suffrages, but made themselves fit by their preceding <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> to receive the fruit of suffrages. Hence it does not follow that their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is rendered unavailing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing hinders the rich from being in some respects better off than the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, for instance as regards the expiation of their punishment. But this is as nothing in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, where the poor are shown to be better off by the authority quoted.

<h2 id="article13">Article 13. Whether suffrages offered for several are of as much value to each one as if they had been offered for each in particular?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that suffrages offered for several are of as much value to each one as if they had been offered for each in particular. For it is clear that if one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> receives a lesson he loses nothing if others receive the lesson with him. Therefore in like manner a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom a suffrage is offered loses nothing if some one else is reckoned together with him: and consequently if it be offered for several, it is of as much value to each one as if it were offered for each in particular.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is to be observed that according to the common practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when Mass is said for one deceased <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are added for other deceased <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Now this would not be done, if the dead <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom the Mass is said were to lose something thereby. Therefore the same conclusion follows as above.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, suffrages, especially of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, rely on the Divine power. But with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just as it makes no difference whether He helps by means of many or by means of a few, so it differs not whether He assists many or a few. Therefore if the one same <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be said for many, each one of them will receive as much assistance as one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> would if that same <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> were said for him alone.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is better to assist many than one. If therefore a suffrage offered for several is of as much value to each one as if it were offered for one alone, it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought not to have appointed a Mass and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to be said for one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in particular, but that Mass ought always to be said for all the faithful departed: and this is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p>Further, a suffrage has a finite efficiency. Therefore if it be divided among many it avails less for each one than if it were offered for one only.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If the value of suffrages be considered according as it is derived from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> uniting the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> together, suffrages offered for several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> avail each one as much as if they were offered for one alone, because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not diminished if its effect be divided among many, in fact rather is it increased; and in like manner <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> increases through being shared by many, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. viii). Consequently many in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> rejoice in one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> no less than one does. On the other hand, if we consider the value of suffrages, inasmuch as they are a kind of satisfaction applied to the dead by the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> offering them, then the suffrage for some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in particular avails him more than that which is offered for him in common with many others; for in this case the effect of the suffrages is divided in virtue of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> among those for whom the suffrages are offered. Hence it is evident that this question depends on the first; and, moreover, it is made clear why special suffrages are appointed to be offered in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Suffrages considered as works of satisfaction do not profit after the manner of an action as teaching does; for teaching, like any other action, produces its effect according to the disposition of the recipient. But they profit after the manner of the payment of a debt, as stated above (12, ad 1); and so the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since suffrages offered for one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> avail others in a certain way, as stated (1), it follows that when Mass is said for one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, it is not unfitting for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be said for others also. For these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are said, not that the satisfaction offered by one suffrage be applied to those others chiefly, but that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> offered for them in particular may profit them also.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> may be considered both on the part of the one who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, and on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>: and its effect depends on both. Consequently though it is no more difficult to the Divine power to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> many than to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> one, nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of one who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> thus is not as satisfactory for many as for one.

<h2 id="article14">Article 14. Whether general suffrages avail those for whom special suffrages are not offered, as much as special suffrages avail those for whom they are offered in addition to general suffrages?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that general suffrages avail those for whom special suffrages are not offered, as much as special suffrages avail those for whom they are offered in addition to general suffrages. For in the life to come each one will be rewarded according to his <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom no suffrages are offered <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> to be assisted after death as much as one for whom special suffrages are offered. Therefore the former will be assisted by general suffrages as much as the latter by special and general suffrages.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is the chief of the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, since it contains <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> whole, has <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> efficacy so to speak. Therefore one offering of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> for all in general is of sufficient value to release all who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>: and consequently general suffrages alone afford as much assistance as special and general suffrages together.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Two goods are more eligible than one. Therefore special suffrages, together with general suffrages, are more profitable to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom they are offered than general suffrages alone.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The reply to this question depends on that which is given to the twelfth inquiry (12): for if the suffrages offered for one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in particular avail indifferently for all, then all suffrages are common; and consequently one for whom the special suffrages are not offered will be assisted as much as the one for whom they are offered, if he be equally worthy. On the other hand, if the suffrages offered for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> do not profit all indifferently, but those chiefly for whom they are offered, then there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that general and special suffrages together avail a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> more than general suffrages alone. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a>, in the text (Sent. iv, D, 45), mentions two opinions: one, when he says that a rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> derives from general, together with special suffrages, an equal profit to that which a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> derives from special suffrages alone; for although the one receives assistance from more sources than the other, he does not receive a greater assistance: the other opinion he mentions when he says that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom special suffrages are offered obtains a more speedy but not a more complete release, because each will be finally released from all punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (12, ad 2) the assistance derived from suffrages is not directly and simply an object of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, but conditionally as it were: hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who is contained in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the Eucharist</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, yet there is a definite effect to which that sacrament is directed. Hence it does not follow that the whole punishment of those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> is expiated by one <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the altar</a>: even so, by the one sacrifice which a man offers, he is not released from the whole satisfaction due for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, wherefore sometimes several Masses are enjoined in satisfaction for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nevertheless, if any thing from special suffrages be left over for those for whom they are offered (for instance if they need them not) we may well <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy this is granted to others for whom those suffrages are not offered, if they need them: as affirmed by <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (Serm.: De his qui in fide dormierunt) who says: "Truly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, forasmuch as He is just will adapt ability to the disabled, and will arrange for an exchange of deficiencies": and this exchange is effected when what is lacking to one is supplied by another.
