<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether vice is contrary to virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For one thing has one contrary, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Metaph. x, text. 17. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> are contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not contrary to it: since <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> applies also to undue disposition of bodily members or of any things whatever.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> denotes a certain perfection of power. But <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> does not denote anything relative to power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Cicero (De Quaest. Tusc. iv) says that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> health." Now sickness or disease, rather than <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, is opposed to health. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Perfect. Justit. ii) that "<a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> in respect of which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." But "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> which makes its subject <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as was shown above (55, A3,4). Therefore <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things may be considered in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>--the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and that to which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is ordained. In the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> we may consider something directly, and we may consider something consequently. Virtue implies "directly" a disposition whereby the subject is well disposed according to the mode of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. vii, text. 17) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a disposition of a perfect thing to that which is best; and by perfect I mean that which is disposed according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." That which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> implies "consequently" is that it is a kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a thing consists in its being well disposed according to the mode of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. That to which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act, as was shown above (Question 56, Article 3).

<p>Accordingly three things are found to be contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. One of these is "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in respect of that to which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is ordained: since, properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> denotes an inordinate act; even as an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is an ordinate and due act: in respect of that which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> implies consequently, viz. that it is a kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, the contrary of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is "<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>": while in respect of that which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> directly, its contrary is "<a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>": because the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of a thing seems to consist in its not being disposed in a way befitting its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. iii): "Whatever is lacking for a thing's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection may be called a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These three things are contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but not in the same respect: for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according as the latter is productive of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work; <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, according as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; while <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> properly as such.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Virtue implies not only perfection of power, the principle of action; but also the due disposition of its subject. The reason for this is because a thing operates according as it is in act: so that a thing needs to be well disposed if it has to produce a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work. It is in this respect that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As Cicero says (De Quaest. Tusc. iv), "disease and sickness are <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>," for in speaking of the body "he calls it" disease "when the whole body is infected," for instance, with fever or the like; he calls it sickness "when the disease is attended with weakness"; and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> "when the parts of the body are not well compacted together." And although at times there may be disease in the body without sickness, for instance, when a man has a hidden complaint without being hindered outwardly from his wonted occupations; "yet, in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," as he says, "these two things are indistinguishable, except in thought." For whenever a man is ill-disposed inwardly, through some inordinate affection, he is rendered thereby unfit for fulfilling his duties: since "a tree is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its fruit," i.e. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by his works, according to <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse33">Matthew 12:33</a>. But "<a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," as Cicero says (De Quaest. Tusc. iv), "is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or affection of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> discordant and inconsistent with itself through life": and this is to be found even without disease and sickness, e.g. when a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from weakness or passion. Consequently <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is of wider extent than sickness or disease; even as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> extends to more things than health; for health itself is reckoned a kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> (Phys. vii, text. 17). Consequently <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is reckoned as contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, more fittingly than sickness or disease.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether vice is contrary to nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in us, not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but by infusion or habituation, as stated above (63, A1,2,3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is impossible to become habituated to that which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: thus "a stone never becomes habituated to upward movement" (Ethic. ii, 1). But some men become habituated to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, anything contrary to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is not found in the greater number of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> possessed of that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is found in the greater number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse13">Matthew 7:13</a>): "Broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is compared to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, as act to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is defined as "a word, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, or desire, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> shows (Contra Faust. xxii, 27). But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore we should say that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, rather than to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. iii, 13): "Every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, simply because it is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a thing consists in its being well disposed in a manner befitting its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Hence the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of any thing consists in its being disposed in a manner not befitting its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and for this reason is that thing "vituperated," which word is derived from "<a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>" according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Lib. Arb. iii, 14).

<p>But it must be observed that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing is chiefly the form from which that thing derives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> derives his <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from his rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and consequently whatever is contrary to the order of reason is, properly speaking, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; while whatever is in accord with reason, is in accord with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be in accord with reason, and his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is to be against reason," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which makes a man <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and his work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is in accord with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for as much as it accords with his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: while <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in so far as it is contrary to the order of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as regards their perfection of being, yet they incline us to that which accords with reason, i.e. with the order of reason. For Cicero says (De Inv. Rhet. ii) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in accord with reason, like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>": and it is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is said to be in accord with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and on the other hand that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking there of a thing being against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in so far as "being against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" is contrary to "being from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>": and not in so far as "being against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" is contrary to "being in accord with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," in which latter sense <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are said to be in accord with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in as much as they incline us to that which is suitable to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is a twofold <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and the sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And since it is through the operation of his senses that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> accomplishes acts of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, hence there are more who follow the inclinations of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, than who follow the order of reason: because more reach the beginning of a business than achieve its completion. Now the presence of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is owing to the fact that he follows the inclination of his sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> against the order of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Whatever is <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a> in a work of art, is unnatural to the art which produced that work. Now the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is compared to the order of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as art to a work of art. Therefore it amounts to the same that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are against the order of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and that they are contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. iii, 6) that "every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as such, is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in so far as it fails from the Divine art whereby it was made."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether vice is worse than a vicious act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, i.e. a bad <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, is worse than a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, i.e. a bad act. For, as the more lasting a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is, the better it is, so the longer an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lasts, the worse it is. Now a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is more lasting than <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> acts, that pass forthwith. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is worse than a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, several <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are more to be shunned than one. But a bad <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is virtually the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of many bad acts. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is worse than a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> act.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is more potent than its effect. But a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> produces its actions both as to their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and as to their badness. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is more potent than its act, both in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and in badness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> punished for a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> act; but not for a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, so long as no act ensues. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> action is worse than a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> stands midway between power and act. Now it is evident that both in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, act precedes power, as stated in Metaph. ix, 19. For it is better to do well than to be able to do well, and in like manner, it is more blameworthy to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, than to be able to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: whence it also follows that both in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and in badness, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> stands midway between power and act, so that, to wit, even as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> stands above the corresponding power in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or in badness, so does it stand below the corresponding act. This is also made clear from the fact that a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad, save in so far as it induces to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad act: wherefore a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad by reason of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or badness of its act: so that an act surpasses its <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or badness, since "the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a thing being such, is yet more so."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Nothing hinders one thing from standing above another simply, and below it in some respect. Now a thing is deemed above another simply if it surpasses it in a point which is proper to both; while it is deemed above it in a certain respect, if it surpasses it in something which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to both. Now it has been shown from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of act and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, that act surpasses <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> both in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and in badness. Whereas the fact that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is more lasting than act, is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to them, and is due to the fact that they are both found in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> such that it cannot always be in action, and whose action consists in a transient movement. Consequently act simply excels in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and badness, but <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> excels in a certain respect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is several acts, not simply, but in a certain respect, i.e. virtually. Wherefore this does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> precedes act simply, both in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and in badness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Habit <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> act by way of efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>: but act <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, by way of final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, in respect of which we consider the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Consequently act surpasses <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> both in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and in badness.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether sin is compatible with virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> act, i.e. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For contraries cannot be together in the same subject. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is, in some way, contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is worse than <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> act than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> cannot be in the same subject with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: neither, therefore, can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> occurs in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, even as in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> matters (Phys. ii, text. 82). Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> never happens in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, except through some corruption of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power; thus monsters are due to corruption of some elemental force in the seed, as stated in Phys. ii. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> occurs in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> matters, except through the corruption of some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: so that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be together in the same subject.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 2,3) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is engendered and corrupted by contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>." Now one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (Question 51, Article 3): and, consequently, one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act does not corrupt <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore they can be together in the same subject.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sin is compared to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> act to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now the position of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not the same as that of a form in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing. For the form of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing produces, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, an operation befitting itself; wherefore a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form is incompatible with the act of a contrary form: thus heat is incompatible with the act of cooling, and lightness with downward movement (except perhaps <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> be used by some extrinsic mover): whereas the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that resides in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, does not, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, produce its operation, but is used by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> when he wills. Consequently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, while possessing a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, may either fail to use the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, or produce a contrary act; and so a man having a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may produce an act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, so long as there is but one, cannot corrupt <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if we compare the act to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: since, just as <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not engendered by one act, so neither is it destroyed by one act as stated above (63, 2, ad 2). But if we compare the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, then it is possible for some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to be destroyed by one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act. For every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is the root of all the infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and consequently, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> being banished by one act of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it follows that all the infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are expelled "as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." And I say on account of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, whose <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> remain unquickened after mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that they are no longer <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. On the other hand, since venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is neither contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, nor banishes it, as a consequence, neither does it expel the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. As to the acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, they are not destroyed by one act of any kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Accordingly, mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is incompatible with the infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but is consistent with acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: while venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is compatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, whether infused or acquired.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sin is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not by reason of itself, but by reason of its act. Hence <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is incompatible with the act, but not with the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Vice is directly contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act: and so <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> excludes <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> excludes acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers act of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, and hence so long as the power is unimpaired, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be found in the act. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> do not produce their acts of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; hence the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether every sin includes an action?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> includes an action. For as <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is compared with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, even so is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> compared with <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Now there can be no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> without an action. Neither, therefore, can there be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without action.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. iii, 18) [Cf. De Vera Relig. xiv.]: So "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is it that every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, that, unless it be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, it is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all." Now nothing can be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, save through an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> implies an act.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> could be without act, it would follow that a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as soon as he ceases doing what he ought. Now he who never does something that he ought to do, ceases continually doing what he ought. Therefore it would follow that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> continually; and this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without an act.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse17">James 4:17</a>): "To him . . . who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and doth it not, to him it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Now "not to do" does not imply an act. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be without act.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The reason for urging this question has reference to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, about which there have been various opinions. For some say that in every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> there is some act, either interior or exterior--interior, as when a man wills "not to go to church," when he is bound to go--exterior, as when a man, at the very hour that he is bound to go to church (or even before), occupies himself in such a way that he is hindered from going. This seems, in a way, to amount to the same as the first, for whoever wills one thing that is incompatible with this other, wills, consequently, to go without this other: unless, perchance, it does not occur to him, that what he wishes to do, will hinder him from that which he is bound to do, in which case he might be deemed guilty of negligence. On the other hand, others say, that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> suppose an act: for the mere fact of not doing what one is bound to do is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Now each of these opinions has some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in it. For if in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> we look merely at that in which the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> will be sometimes with an interior act, as when a man wills "not to go to church": while sometimes it will be without any act at all, whether interior or exterior, as when a man, at the time that he is bound to go to church, does not think of going or not going to church.

<p>If, however, in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, we consider also the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, or occasions of the <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> include some act. For there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, unless we omit what we can do or not do: and that we turn aside so as not to do what we can do or not do, must needs be due to some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or occasion, either united with the omission or preceding it. Now if this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power, the omission will not be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, as when anyone omits going to church on account of sickness: but if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or occasion be subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the omission is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>; and such <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, must needs always include some act, at least the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: which act sometimes bears directly on the <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, as when a man wills "not to go to church," because it is too much trouble; and in this case this act, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, because the volition of any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever, pertains, of itself, to that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since voluntariness is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Sometimes, however, the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> bears directly on something else which hinders <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from doing what he ought, whether this something else be united with the <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, as when a man wills to play at the time he ought to go to church--or, precede the <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, as when a man wills to sit up late at night, the result being that he does not go to church in the morning. In this case the act, interior or exterior, is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, since the omission follows outside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, and that which is outside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> (Phys. ii, text. 49,50). Wherefore it is evident that then the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> has indeed an act united with, or preceding the <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, but that this act is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>.

<p>Now in judging about things, we must be guided by that which is proper to them, and not by that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>: and consequently it is truer to say that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be without any act; else the circumstantial acts and occasions would be <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to other actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> More things are required for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> results from a whole and entire <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> results from each single defect," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv): so that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may arise from a man doing what he ought not, or by his not doing what he ought; while there can be no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, unless a man do willingly what he ought to do: wherefore there can be no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> without act, whereas there can be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The term "<a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>" is applied not only to that on which the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is brought to bear, but also to that which we have the power to do or not to do, as stated in Ethic. iii, 5. Hence even not to will may be called <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has it in his power to will, and not to will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> is contrary to an affirmative precept which binds always, but not for always. Hence, by omitting to act, a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> only for the time at which the affirmative precept binds him to act.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether sin is fittingly defined as a word, deed, or desire contrary to the eternal law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is unfittingly defined by saying: "Sin is a word, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, or desire, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." Because "Word," "<a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>," and "desire" imply an act; whereas not every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> implies an act, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). Therefore this definition does not include every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Duab. Anim. xii): "Sin is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to retain or obtain what <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> forbids." Now <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is comprised under desire, in so far as desire denotes any act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore it was enough to say: "Sin is a desire contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>," nor was there need to add "word" or "<a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> apparently consists properly in aversion from the end: because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are measured chiefly with regard to the end as explained above (1, 3; k1 18, A4,6; 20, A2,3): wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Lib. Arb. i) defines <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in reference to the end, by saying that "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is nothing else than to neglect <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things, and seek after temporal things": and again he says (Qq. lxxxii, qu. 30) that "all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> consists in using what we should enjoy, and in enjoying what we should use." Now the definition is question contains no mention of aversion from our due end: therefore it is an insufficient definition of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a thing is said to be forbidden, because it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now not all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through being forbidden, but some are forbidden because they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in general should not be defined as being against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> denotes a bad <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>, as was explained above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is to be against reason, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore it would have been better to say that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is against reason than to say that it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> the authority of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> suffices (Contra Faust. xxii, 27).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was shown above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is nothing else than a bad <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>. Now that an act is a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> is due to its being <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as stated above (Question 1, Article 1), whether it be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as being elicited by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, e.g. to will or to choose, or as being commanded by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, e.g. the exterior actions of speech or operation. Again, a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through lacking conformity with its due measure: and conformity of measure in a thing depends on a rule, from which if that thing depart, it is incommensurate. Now there are two rules of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will: one is proximate and homogeneous, viz. the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; the other is the first rule, viz. the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> reason, so to speak. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Faust. xxii, 27) includes two things in the definition of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; one, pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>, and which is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so to speak, of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when he says "word," "<a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>," or "desire"; the other, pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and which is the form, as it were, of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when he says, "contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Affirmation and negation are reduced to one same genus: e.g. in Divine things, begotten and unbegotten are reduced to the genus "relation," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Trin. v, 6,7): and so "word" and "<a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>" denote equally what is said and what is not said, what is done and what is not done.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which commands all <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acts, in which alone is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be found: and hence it is that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> sometimes defines <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in reference to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> alone. But since external acts also pertain to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of themselves, as stated, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in defining <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to include something referring to external action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> first and foremost directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his end, and in consequence, makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be well disposed in regard to things which are directed to the end: hence when he says, "contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>," he includes aversion from the end and all other forms of inordinateness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> When it is said that not every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through being forbidden, this must be understood of prohibition by positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. If, however, the prohibition be referred to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, which is contained primarily in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but secondarily in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> code of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, then every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through being prohibited: since it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, precisely because it is inordinate.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The theologian considers <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> chiefly as an offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the moral philosopher, as something contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> defines <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with reference to its being "contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>," more fittingly than with reference to its being contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; the more so, as the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> directs us in many things that surpass <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, e.g. in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.
