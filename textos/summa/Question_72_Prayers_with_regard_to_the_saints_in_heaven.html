<h1>Question 72. Prayers with regard to the saints in heaven</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5072.htm#article1"> Do the saints have knowledge of our prayers?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5072.htm#article2"> Should we beseech them to pray for us?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5072.htm#article3"> Are the prayers they pour forth for us always granted?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the saints have knowledge of our prayers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/isa062.htm#verse16">Isaiah 62:16</a>, "Thou art our father and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> hath not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> us, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hath been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of us," says that "the dead <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what the living, even their own children, are doing." This is taken from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Cura pro Mort. xiii), where he quotes the aforesaid authority, and the following are his words: "If such great men as the patriarchs <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what was happening to the people begotten of them, how can the dead occupy themselves in watching and helping the affairs and actions of the living?" Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> cannot be cognizant of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the following words are addressed to King Joas (<a href="../bible/2ki022.htm#verse20">2 Kings 22:20</a>): "Therefore" (i.e. because thou hast wept before Me), "I will gather thee to thy fathers . . . that thy eyes may not see all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which I will bring upon this place." But Joas would have gained no such advantage from his death if he were to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> after death what was happening to his people. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> after death <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not our actions, and thus they are not cognizant of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more perfect a man is in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, the more he succors his neighbor when the latter is in danger. Now the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in this life, watch over their neighbor, especially their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsfolk</a>, when these are in danger, and manifestly assist them. Since then, after death, their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is much greater, if they were cognizant of our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, much more would they watch over their friends and kindred and assist them in their needs: and yet, seemingly, they do not. Therefore it would seem that our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, even as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> after death see the Word, so do the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of whom it is stated (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse10">Matthew 18:10</a>) that "their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> always see the face of My Father." Yet the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> through seeing the Word do not therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, since the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are cleansed from their lack of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> [Cf. I, 106, 1], as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Coel. Hier. vii). Therefore although the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> see the Word, they do not see therein our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and other things that happen in our regard.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is the searcher of hearts. Now <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is seated chiefly in the heart. Therefore it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Therefore our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are unknown to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse21">Job 14:21</a>, "Whether his children come to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or dishonor, he shall not understand," says (Moral. xii): "This does not apply to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, for since they have an insight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> we must nowise <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that anything outside that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is unknown to them." Therefore they are cognizant of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. ii): "All creatures are little to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: because however little it sees of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator's</a> light, every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing appears foreshortened to it." Now apparently the chief obstacle to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> being cognizant of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and other happenings in our regard is that they are far removed from us. Since then distance does not prevent these things, as appears from the authority quoted, it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are cognizant of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and of what happens here below.

<p>Further, unless they were aware of what happens in our regard they would not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, since they would be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of our needs. But this is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Vigilantius, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> asserts in his letter against him. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are cognizant of what happens in our regard.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is a sufficient medium for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> all things, and this is evident from the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by seeing His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, sees all things. But it does not follow that whoever sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, but only those who comprehend the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [Cf. I, 12, 7,8]: even as the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a principle does not involve the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all that follows from that principle unless the whole <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the principle be comprehended. Wherefore, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> do not comprehend the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it does not follow that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all that can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>--for which reason the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are taught concerning certain matters by the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, though they all see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but each of the blessed must needs see in the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> as many other things as the perfection of his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> requires. For the perfection of a man's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> requires him to have whatever he will, and to will nothing amiss: and each one wills with a right <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what concerns himself. Hence since no rectitude is lacking to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, they wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what concerns themselves, and consequently it follows that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it in the Word. Now it pertains to their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that they assist the needy for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: for thus they become <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> co-operators, "than which nothing is more Godlike," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Coel. Hier. iii). Wherefore it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are cognizant of such things as are required for this purpose; and so it is manifest that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in the Word the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, devotions, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of those who have recourse to their assistance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is to be understood as referring to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is devoid of obscurity in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men. But he is not speaking of their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the Word, for it is clear that when Isaias said this, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had no such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, since no one had come to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, after this life, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what happens here below, we must not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they grieve through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the woes of those whom they loved in this world: for they are so filled with heavenly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that sorrow finds no place in them. Wherefore if after death they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the woes of their friends, their grief is forestalled by their removal from this world before their woes occur. Perhaps, however, the non-glorified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> would grieve somewhat, if they were aware of the distress of their dear ones: and since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Josias was not glorified as soon as it went out from his body, it is in this respect that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> uses this argument to show that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the living.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have their will fully conformed to the Divine will even as regards the things willed. and consequently, although they retain the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love of charity</a> towards their neighbor, they do not succor him otherwise than they see to be in conformity with the disposition of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Nevertheless, it is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that they help their neighbor very much by <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">interceding</a> for him to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although it does not follow that those who see the Word see all things in the Word, they see those things that pertain to the perfection of their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone of Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the thoughts of the heart: yet others <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, in so far as these are revealed to them, either by their vision of the Word or by any other means.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether we ought to call upon the saints to pray for us?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought not to call upon the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us. For no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> asks anyone's friends to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him, except in so far as he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> he will more easily find favor with them. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> more merciful than any <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and consequently His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is more easily inclined to give us a gracious hearing, than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. Therefore it would seem unnecessary to make the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> mediators between us and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they may intercede for us.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if we ought to beseech them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, this is only because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to be acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holier</a> a man is, the more is his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore we ought always to bespeak the greater <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to intercede for us with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and never the lesser ones.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is called the "Holy of Holies," and, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it is competent to Him to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. Yet we never call upon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us. Therefore neither should we ask the other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to do so.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whenever one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> intercedes for another at the latter's request, he presents his petition to the one with whom he intercedes for him. Now it is unnecessary to present anything to one to whom all things are present. Therefore it is unnecessary to make the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> our intercessors with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it is unnecessary to do a thing if, without doing it, the purpose for which it is done would be achieved in the same way, or else not achieved at all. Now the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> would <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us just the same, or would not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us at all, whether we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to them or not: for if we be worthy of their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, they would <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us even though we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> not to them, while if we be unworthy they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> not for us even though we ask them to. Therefore it seems altogether unnecessary to call on them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job005.htm#verse1">Job 5:1</a>): "Call . . . if there be any that will answer thee, and turn to some of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>." Now, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 30) on this passage, "we call upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when we beseech Him in <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>." Therefore when we wish to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we should turn to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, that they may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for us.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are more acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than those who are on the way. Now we should make the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, who are on the way, our intercessors with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after the example of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, who said (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse30">Romans 15:30</a>): "I beseech you . . . brethren, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, that you help me in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for me to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Much more, therefore, should we ask the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to help us by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Further, an additional argument is provided by the common custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which asks for the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the Litany.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. v) the order established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> among things is that "the last should be led to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by those that are midway between." Wherefore, since the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are nearest to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the order of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> requires that we, who while we remain in the body are <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> from the Lord, should be brought back to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are between us and Him: and this happens when the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> pours forth its effect into us through them. And since our return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should correspond to the outflow of His boons upon us, just as the Divine favors reach us by means of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> intercession, so should we, by their means, be brought back to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we may receive His favors again. Hence it is that we make them our intercessors with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and our mediators as it were, when we ask them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not on account of any defect in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power that He works by means of second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, but it is for the perfection of the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and the more manifold outpouring of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> on things, through His bestowing on them not only the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which is proper to them, but also the faculty of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in others. Even so it is not through any defect in His mercy, that we need to bespeak His clemency through the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but to the end that the aforesaid order in things be observed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the greater <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are more acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than the lesser, it is sometimes profitable to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the lesser; and this for five reasons. First, because sometimes one has greater devotion for a lesser <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> than for a greater, and the effect of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> depends very much on one's devotion. Secondly, in order to avoid tediousness, for continual attention to one thing makes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> weary; whereas by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to different <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, the fervor of our devotion is aroused anew as it were. Thirdly, because it is granted to some <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to exercise their patronage in certain special cases, for instance to <a href="../cathen/01553d.htm">Saint Anthony</a> against the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Fourthly, that due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> be given by us to all. Fifthly, because the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of several sometimes obtain that which would not have been obtained by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> is an act, and acts belong to particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> [supposita]. Hence, were we to say: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us," except we added something, this would seem to refer to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and consequently to agree with the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> either of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, who distinguished in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the son of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, who asserted that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is less than the Father. Wherefore to avoid these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> says not: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us," but "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, hear us," or "have mercy on us."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As we shall state further on (3) the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are said to present our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not as though they notified things unknown to Him, but because they ask <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to grant those <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> a gracious hearing, or because they seek the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about them, namely what ought to be done according to His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is rendered worthy of a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for him by the very fact that in his need he has recourse to him with pure devotion. Hence it is not unnecessary to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the prayers which the saints pour forth to God for us are always granted?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> pour forth to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for us are not always granted. For if they were always granted, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> would be heard especially in regard to matters concerning themselves. But they are not heard in reference to these things; wherefore it is stated in the Apocalypse (<a href="../bible/rev006.htm#verse11">6:11</a>) that on the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> beseeching vengeance on them that dwell on earth, "it was said to them that they should rest for a little while till the number of their brethren should be filled up [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'till their fellow-servants and their brethren . . . should be filled up']." Much less therefore, are they heard in reference to matters concerning others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/jer015.htm#verse1">Jeremiah 15:1</a>): "If <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Samuel shall stand before Me, My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not towards this people." Therefore, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are not always heard when they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for us.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are stated to be equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not always heard in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which they offer up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This is evident from <a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse12">Daniel 10:12-13</a>, where it is written: "I am come for thy words: but the prince of the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> resisted me one-and-twenty days." But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who spoke had not come to <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel's</a> aid except by asking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be set free; and yet the fulfillment of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was hindered. Therefore neither are other saints always heard by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whosoever obtains something by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> it in a sense. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are not in the state of meriting. Therefore they cannot obtain anything for us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in all things, conform their will to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore they will nothing but what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to will. But no one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> save for what he wills. Therefore they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> not save for what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to will. Now that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills would be done even without their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for it. Therefore their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are not efficacious for obtaining anything.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the whole heavenly court, if they could obtain anything, would be more efficacious than all the petitions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> here below. Now if the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> here below for some one in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> were to be multiplied, he would be wholly delivered from punishment. Since then the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> on the same account as for us, if they obtain anything for us, their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> would deliver entirely from punishment those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. But this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> because, then the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> suffrages for the dead would be unnecessary.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/2ma015.htm#verse14">2 Maccabees 15:14</a>): "This is he that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayeth</a> much for the people, and for all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city, <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": and that his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was granted is clear from what follows (<a href="../bible/2ma015.htm#verse15">2 Maccabees 15:15</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> stretched forth his right hand, and gave to <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> a sword of gold, saying: Take this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sword, a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," etc.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. contra Vigilant.): "Thou sayest in thy pamphlets, that while we live, we can <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for one another, but that when we are dead no one's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for another will be heard": and afterwards he refutes this in the following words: "If the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> while yet in the body can <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for others, while they are still solicitous for themselves, how much more can they do so when the crown, the victory, the triumph is already theirs!"

<p>Further, this is confirmed by the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which often asks to be assisted by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are said to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us in two ways. First, by "express" <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, when by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> they seek a hearing of the Divine clemency on our behalf: secondly, by "interpretive" <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, namely by their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> which, being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, avail not only them unto <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but also us as suffrages and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, even as the shedding of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood is said to ask pardon for us. In both ways the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>' <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> considered in themselves avail to obtain what they ask, yet on our part they may fail so that we obtain not the fruit of their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, in so far as they are said to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us by reason of their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> availing on our behalf. But in so far as they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us by asking something for us in their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are always granted, since they will only what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills, nor do they ask save for what they will to be done; and what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills is always fulfilled--unless we speak of His "antecedent" will, whereby "He wishes all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved" [Cf. I, 19, 6, ad 1]. For this <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not always fulfilled; wherefore no wonder if that also which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will according to this kind of will be not fulfilled sometimes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> is merely their desire to obtain the robe of the body and the fellowship of those who will be saved, and their consent to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in punishing the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rev006.htm#verse11">Apocalypse 6:11</a>, "How long, O Lord," says: "They desire an increase of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and they consent to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> speaks there of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Samuel according to their state in this life. For we read that they withstood <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the people. And yet even if they had been living at the time in question, they would have been unable to placate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> towards the people by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, on account of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of this same people: and it is thus that we are to understand this passage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This dispute among the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> does not mean that they offered contradictory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that they submitted contrary <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> on various sides to the Divine inquiry, with a view of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> pronouncing sentence thereon. This, in fact, is what <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xvii) in explanation of the aforesaid words of <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a>: "The lofty spirits that are set over the nations never fight in behalf of those that act <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, but they <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> judge and try their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. And when the guilt or innocence of any particular nation is brought into the debate of the court above, the ruling spirit of that nation is said to have won or lost in the conflict. Yet the supreme will of their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Maker</a> is victorious over all, for since they have it ever before their eyes, they will not what they are unable to obtain," wherefore neither do they seek for it. And consequently it is clear that their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are always heard.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are not in a state to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for themselves, when once they are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, they are in a state to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for others, or rather to assist others by reason of their previous <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>: for while living they <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> that their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> should be heard after their death.

<p>Or we may reply that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> on one count, and impetratory on another. For <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> consists in a certain equation of the act to the end for which it is intended, and which is given to it as its reward; while the impetration of a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> depends on the liberality of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> supplicated. Hence <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> sometimes, through the liberality of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> supplicated, obtains that which was not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> either by the suppliant, or by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> supplicated for: and so, although the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are not in the state of meriting, it does not follow that they are not in the state of impetrating.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As appears from the authority of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> quoted above (ad 3), the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will nothing but what they see to be in the Divine will: and so neither do they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for aught else. Nor is their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> fruitless, since as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praed. Sanct. [De Dono Persever. xxii]): "The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> profit the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinate</a>, because it is perhaps pre-ordained that they shall be saved through the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of those who intercede for them": and consequently <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also wills that what the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> see Him to will shall be fulfilled through their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for the dead are as so many satisfactions of the living in lieu of the dead: and accordingly they free the dead from the punishment which the latter have not paid. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are not in the state of making satisfaction; and consequently the parallel fails between their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
