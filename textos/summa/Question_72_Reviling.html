<h1>Question 72. Reviling</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3072.htm#article1"> What is reviling?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3072.htm#article2"> Is every reviling a mortal sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3072.htm#article3"> Should one check revilers?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3072.htm#article4"> The origin of reviling</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether reviling consists in words?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that reviling does not consist in words. Reviling implies some injury inflicted on one's neighbor, since it is a kind of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. But words seem to inflict no injury on one's neighbor, either in his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or in his belongings. Therefore reviling does not consist in words.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, reviling seems to imply dishonor. But a man can be dishonored or slighted by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> more than by words. Therefore it seems that reviling consists, not in words but in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a dishonor inflicted by words is called a railing or a taunt. But reviling seems to differ from railing or taunt. Therefore reviling does not consist in words.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Nothing, save words, is perceived by the hearing. Now reviling is perceived by the hearing according to <a href="../bible/jer020.htm#verse10">Jeremiah 20:10</a>, "I heard reviling [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'contumelies'] on every side." Therefore reviling consists in words.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Reviling denotes the dishonoring of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and this happens in two ways: for since <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> results from excellence, one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> dishonors another, first, by depriving him of the excellence for which he is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. This is done by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, whereof we have spoken above (64, seqq.). Secondly, when a man publishes something against another's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, thus bringing it to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the latter and of other men. This reviling properly so called, and is done I some kind of signs. Now, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 3), "compared with words all other signs are very few, for words have obtained the chief place among men for the purpose of expressing whatever the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> conceives." Hence reviling, properly speaking consists in words: wherefore, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x) that a reviler [contumeliosus] "is hasty and bursts out [tumet] in injurious words." Since, however, things are also signified by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, which on this account have the same significance as words, it follows that reviling in a wider sense extends also to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse30">Romans 1:30</a>, "contumelious, proud," says: "The contumelious are those who by word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> revile and shame others."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Our words, if we consider them in their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, i.e. as audible sound injure no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, except perhaps by jarring of the ear, as when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> speaks too loud. But, considered as signs conveying something to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of others, they may do many kinds of harm. Such is the harm done to a man to the detriment of his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, or of the respect due to him from others. Hence the reviling is greater if one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> reproach another in the presence of many: and yet there may still be reviling if he reproach him by himself. in so far as the speaker acts <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> against the respect due to the hearer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> One <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> slights another by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in so far as such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or signify that which is against that other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. On the former case it is not a matter of reviling but of some other kind of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, of which we have spoken above (Q64,65,66): where as in the latter case there is reviling, in so far as <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> have the significant force of words.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Railing and taunts consist in words, even as reviling, because by all of them a man's faults are exposed to the detriment of his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Such faults are of three kinds. First, there is the fault of guilt, which is exposed by "reviling" words. Secondly, there is the fault of both guilt and punishment, which is exposed by "taunts" [convicium], because "<a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>" is commonly spoken of in connection with not only the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but also the body. Hence if one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> says spitefully to another that he is blind, he taunts but does not revile him: whereas if one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> calls another a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, he not only taunts but also reviles him. Thirdly, a man reproaches another for his inferiority or indigence, so as to lessen the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to him for any kind of excellence. This is done by "upbraiding" words, and properly speaking, occurs when one spitefully reminds a man that one has succored him when he was in need. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir020.htm#verse15">Sirach 20:15</a>): "He will give a few things and upbraid much." Nevertheless these terms are sometimes employed one for the other.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether reviling or railing is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that reviling or railing is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now railing is the act of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, viz. of wittiness <em>eutrapelia</em> [Cf. I-II, 60, 5] to which it pertains to rail well, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 8). Therefore railing or reviling is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not to be found in perfect men; and yet these sometimes give utterance to railing or reviling. Thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse1">Galatians 3:1</a>): "O senseless Galatians!," and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse25">Luke 24:25</a>): "O foolish and slow of heart to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>!" Therefore railing or reviling is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, although that which is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by reason of its genus may become mortal, that which is mortal by reason of its genus cannot become venial, as stated above (I-II, 88, 4,6). Hence if by reason of its genus it were a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to give utterance to railing or reviling, it would follow that it is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this is apparently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, as may be seen in the case of one who utters a reviling word indeliberately or through slight <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Therefore reviling or railing is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by reason of its genus.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Nothing but mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deserves the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Now railing or reviling deserves the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew 5:22</a>, "Whosoever shall say to his brother . . . Thou fool, shall be in danger of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> fire." Therefore railing or reviling is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), words are injurious to other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, not as sounds, but as signs, and this signification depends on the speaker's inward <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Hence, in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of word, it seems that we ought to consider with what <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> the words are uttered. Since then railing or reviling <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> denotes a dishonoring, if the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the utterer is to dishonor the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, this is properly and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to give utterance to railing or reviling: and this is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no less than <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> or robbery, since a man loves his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> no less than his possessions. If, on the other hand, a man says to another a railing or reviling word, yet with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, not of dishonoring him, but rather perhaps of correcting him or with some like purpose, he utters a railing or reviling not formally and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> and materially, in so far to wit as he says that which might be a railing or reviling. Hence this may be sometimes a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and sometimes without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all. Nevertheless there is need of discretion in such matters, and one should use such words with moderation, because the railing might be so grave that being uttered inconsiderately it might dishonor the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> against whom it is uttered. On such a case a man might commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even though he did not intend to dishonor the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: just as were a man incautiously to injure grievously another by striking him in fun, he would not be without blame.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It belongs to wittiness to utter some slight mockery, not with intent to dishonor or pain the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is the object of the mockery, but rather with intent to please and amuse: and this may be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if the due circumstances be observed. on the other hand if a man does not shrink from inflicting pain on the object of his witty mockery, so long as he makes others laugh, this is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, as stated in the passage quoted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as it is lawful to strike a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or damnify him in his belongings for the purpose of correction, so too, for the purpose of correction, may one say a mocking word to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whom one has to correct. It is thus that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> called the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> "foolish," and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> called the Galatians "senseless." Yet, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 19), "seldom and only when it is very <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> should we have recourse to invectives, and then so as to urge <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service, not our own."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of railing or reviling depends on the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the utterer, it may happen to be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if it be a slight railing that does not inflict much dishonor on a man, and be uttered through lightness of heart or some slight <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, without the fixed purpose of dishonoring him, for instance when one intends by such a word to give but little pain.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether one ought to suffer oneself to be reviled?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one ought not to suffer oneself to be reviled. For he that suffers himself to be reviled, encourages the reviler. But one ought not to do this. Therefore one ought not to suffer oneself to be reviled, but rather reply to the reviler.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one ought to love oneself more than another. Now one ought not to suffer another to be reviled, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse10">Proverbs 26:10</a>): "He that putteth a fool to silence appeaseth <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>." Therefore neither should one suffer oneself to be reviled.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man is not allowed to revenge himself, for it is said: "Vengeance belongeth to Me, I will repay" [<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse30">Hebrews 10:30</a>. Now by submitting to be reviled a man revenges himself, according to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xxii, in Ep. ad Rom.): "If thou wilt be revenged, be silent; thou hast dealt him a fatal blow." Therefore one ought not by silence to submit to reviling words, but rather answer back.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa037.htm#verse13">Psalm 37:13</a>): "They that sought <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to me spoke vain things," and afterwards (<a href="../bible/psa037.htm#verse14">Psalm 37:14</a>) he says: "But I as a deaf <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, heard not; and as a dumb <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> not opening his mouth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as we need patience in things done against us, so do we need it in those said against us. Now the precepts of patience in those things done against us refer to the preparedness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 19) exposition on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> precept, "If one strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other" The words as quoted by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> are a blending of <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse39">Matthew 5:39</a> and <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse29">Luke 6:29</a>: that is to say, a man ought to be prepared to do so if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. But he is not always bound to do this actually: since not even did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> do so, for when He received a blow, He said: "Why strikest thou Me?" (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse23">John 18:23</a>). Consequently the same applies to the reviling words that are said against us. For we are bound to hold our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> prepared to submit to be reviled, if it should be expedient. Nevertheless it sometimes behooves us to withstand against being reviled, and this chiefly for two reasons. First, for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the reviler; namely, that his daring may be checked, and that he may not repeat the attempt, according to <a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse5">Proverbs 26:5</a>, "Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> himself to be wise." Secondly, for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of many who would be prevented from progressing in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> on account of our being reviled. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. ix, Super Ezech.): "Those who are so placed that their life should be an example to others, ought, if possible, to silence their detractors, lest their preaching be not heard by those who could have heard it, and they continue their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> conduct through contempt of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The daring of the railing reviler should be checked with moderation, i.e. as a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and not through <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> for one's own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse4">Proverbs 26:4</a>): "Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou be like him."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> prevents another from being reviled there is not the danger of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> for one's own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> as there is when a man defends himself from being reviled: indeed rather would it seem to proceed from a sense of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It would be an act of revenge to keep silence with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of provoking the reviler to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but it would be praiseworthy to be silent, in order to give place to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir008.htm#verse4">Sirach 8:4</a>): "Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, and heap not wood upon his fire."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether reviling arises from anger?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that reviling does not arise from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse2">Proverbs 11:2</a>): "Where <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is, there shall also be reviling [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'reproach']." But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Therefore reviling does not arise from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse3">Proverbs 20:3</a>): "All fools are meddling with revilings [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'reproaches']." Now folly is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to wisdom, as stated above (Question 46, Article 1); whereas <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is opposed to meekness. Therefore reviling does not arise from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is diminished by its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of reviling is diminished if one gives vent to it through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: for it is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to revile out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> than out of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Therefore reviling does not arise from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 45) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> gives rise to revilings."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> While one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may arise from various <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, it is nevertheless said to have its source chiefly in that one from which it is wont to arise most frequently, through being closely connected with its end. Now reviling is closely connected with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger's</a> end, which is revenge: since the easiest way for the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to take revenge on another is to revile him. Therefore reviling arises chiefly from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Reviling is not directed to the end of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> which is excellency. Hence reviling does not arise directly from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> disposes a man to revile, in so far as those who think themselves to excel, are more prone to despise others and inflict injuries on them, because they are more easily angered, through deeming it an affront to themselves whenever anything is done against their will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 6) "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> listens imperfectly to reason": wherefore an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suffers a defect of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and in this he is like the foolish <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence reviling arises from folly on account of the latter's kinship with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Rhet. ii, 4) "an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeks an open offense, but he who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> does not worry about this." Hence reviling which denotes a manifest injury belongs to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.
