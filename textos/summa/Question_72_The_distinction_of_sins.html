<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether sins differ in species according to their objects?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, according to their objects. For acts are said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in relation, chiefly, to their end, as shown above (1, 3; 18, A4,6). Since then <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is nothing else than a bad <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>, as stated above (Question 71, Article 1), it seems that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should differ specifically according to their ends rather than according to their objects.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, being a privation, differs specifically according to the different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of opposites. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the genus of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> differ specifically according to their opposites rather than according to their objects.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> differed specifically according to their objects, it would be impossible to find the same specific <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with diverse objects: and yet such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are to be found. For <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is about things <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and material as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxiv, 18); and avarice is about different kinds of things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according to their objects.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "Sin is a word, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, or desire against <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>." Now words, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and desires differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according to their various objects: since acts differ by their objects, as stated above (Question 18, Article 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, also differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according to their objects.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 71, Article 6), two things concur in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, viz. the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act, and its inordinateness, which consists in departing from <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>. Of these two, one is referred <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to the sinner, who intends such and such an act in such and such <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; while the other, viz. the inordinateness of the act, is referred <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the sinner, for "no one acts intending <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Div. Nom. iv). Now it is evident that a thing derives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> and not from that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>: because what is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> is outside the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> differ specifically on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acts rather than of the inordinateness inherent to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acts differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according to their objects, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (Question 18, Article 2). Therefore it follows that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are properly distinguished in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by their objects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is found chiefly in the end: and therefore the end stands in the relation of object to the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which is at the root of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently it amounts to the same whether <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> differ by their objects or by their ends.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sin is not a pure privation but an act deprived of its due order: hence <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> differ specifically according to their objects of their acts rather than according to their opposites, although, even if they were distinguished in reference to their opposite <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, it would come to the same: since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> differ specifically according to their objects, as stated above (Question 60, Article 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In various things, differing in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or genus, nothing hinders our finding one formal aspect of the object, from which aspect <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> receives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. It is thus that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> seeks excellence in reference to various things; and avarice seeks abundance of things adapted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> use.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether spiritual sins are fittingly distinguished from carnal sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are unfittingly distinguished from carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians 5:19</a>): "The works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, immodesty, luxury, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, witchcrafts," etc. from which it seems that all kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are works of the flesh. Now carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are called works of the flesh. Therefore carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should not be distinguished from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whosoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, walks according to the flesh, as stated in <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse13">Romans 8:13</a>: "If you live according to the flesh, you shall die. But if by the spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live." Now to live or walk according to the flesh seems to pertain to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should not be distinguished from spiritual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the higher part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> or reason, is called the spirit, according to <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse23">Ephesians 4:23</a>: "Be renewed in the spirit of your mind," where spirit stands for reason, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>. Now every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is committed in accordance with the flesh, flows from the reason by its consent; since consent in a sinful act belongs to the higher reason, as we shall state further on (74, 7). Therefore the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are both carnal and spiritual, and consequently they should not be distinguished from one another.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are carnal specifically, this, seemingly, should apply chiefly to those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against his own body. But, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse18">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>), "every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that a man doth, is without the body: but he that committeth fornication, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a> against his own body." Therefore fornication would be the only carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereas the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse3">Ephesians 5:3</a>) reckons <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> with the carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 17) says that "of the seven capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> five are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, and two carnal."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their objects. Now every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in the desire for some mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has an inordinate desire, and the possession of which gives him inordinate pleasure. Now, as explained above (Question 31, Article 3), pleasure is twofold. One belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and is consummated in the mere apprehension of a thing possessed in accordance with desire; this can also be called <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasure, e.g. when one takes pleasure in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise or the like. The other pleasure is bodily or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and is realized in bodily touch, and this can also be called carnal pleasure.

<p>Accordingly, those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which consist in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasure, are called <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; while those which consist in carnal pleasure, are called carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, which consists in the pleasures of the table; and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which consists in sexual pleasures. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse1">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>): "Let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on the same passage, these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are called works of the flesh, not as though they consisted in carnal pleasure; but flesh here denotes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is said to live according to the flesh, when he lives according to himself, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 2,3). The reason of this is because every failing in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is due in some way to the carnal sense.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even in the carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> act, viz. the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: but the end of these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, from which they are named, is carnal pleasure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says, "in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of fornication the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the body's <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> in a special sense, because at the moment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> it can think of nothing else": whereas the pleasure of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, although carnal, does not so utterly absorb the reason. It may also be said that in this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, an injury is done to the body also, for it is defiled inordinately: wherefore by this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> said specifically to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against his body. While <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is reckoned among the carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, stands here for <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> appropriation of another's wife. Again, it may be said that the thing in which the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes pleasure is something bodily, and in this respect <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is numbered with the carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: but the pleasure itself does not belong to the body, but to the spirit, wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 17) that it is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether sins differ specifically in reference to their causes?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> differ specifically in reference to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. For a thing takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from that whence it derives its being. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> derive their being from their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Therefore they take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from them also. Therefore they differ specifically in reference to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, of all the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> seems to have least reference to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now the object in a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is like its material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> differ specifically according to their objects, it seems that much more do they differ in reference to their other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, commenting on <a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse17">Psalm 79:17</a>, "Things set on fire and dug down," says that "every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is due either to fear inducing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, or to love enkindling us to undue ardor." For it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse16">1 John 2:16</a>) that "all that is in the world, is the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh, or [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'and'] the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes, or [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'and'] the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life." Now a thing is said to be in the world on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in as much as the world denotes lovers of the world, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (Tract. ii in Joan.). <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, too (Moral. xxxi, 17), distinguishes all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> according to the seven capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Now all these divisions refer to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore, seemingly, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> differ specifically according to the diversity of their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If this were the case all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> would belong to one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, since they are due to one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse15">Sirach 10:15</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," and (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1 Timothy 6:10</a>) that "the desire of money is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>." Now it is evident that there are various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not differ specifically according to their different <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since there are four kinds of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, they are attributed to various things in various ways. Because the "formal" and the "material" <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> regard properly the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a thing; and consequently <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> differ in respect of their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, both in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and in genus. The "agent" and the "end" regard directly movement and operation: wherefore movements and operations differ specifically in respect of these <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; in different ways, however, because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> active principles are always determined to the same acts; so that the different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> acts are taken not only from the objects, which are the ends or terms of those acts, but also from their active principles: thus heating and cooling are specifically distinct with reference to hot and cold. On the other hand, the active principles in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acts, such as the acts of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, are not determined, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, to one act, and consequently from one active or motive principle, diverse <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can proceed: thus from fear engendering <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may proceed to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, or to neglect the flock committed to his care; and these same things may proceed from love enkindling to undue ardor. Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not differ specifically according to their various active or motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, but only in respect of diversity in the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is the end and object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For it has been shown above (1, 3; 18, A4,6) that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The active principles in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acts, not being determined to one act, do not suffice for the production of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, unless the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be determined to one by the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Metaph. ix, text. 15,16), and consequently <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> derives both its being and its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Objects, in relation to external acts, have the character of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> "about which"; but, in relation to the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, they have the character of end; and it is owing to this that they give the act its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Nevertheless, even considered as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> "about which," they have the character of term, from which movement takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> (Phys. v, text. 4; Ethic. x, 4); yet even terms of movement specify movements, in so far as term has the character of end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These distinctions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are given, not as distinct <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but to show their various <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether sin is fittingly divided into sin against God, against oneself, and against one's neighbor?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is unfittingly divided into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, against one's neighbor, and against oneself. For that which is common to all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should not be reckoned as a part in the division of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But it is common to all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to be against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for it is stated in the definition of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that it is "against <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>," as stated above (Question 66, Article 6). Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should not be reckoned a part of the division of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every division should consist of things in opposition to one another. But these three kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are not opposed to one another: for whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against his neighbor, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against himself and against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not fittingly divided into these three.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, specification is not taken from things external. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor are external to us. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not distinguished specifically with regard to them: and consequently <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is unfittingly divided according to these three.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (De Summo Bono), in giving the division of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, says that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against himself, against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and against his neighbor."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (71, A1,6), <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an inordinate act. Now there should be a threefold order in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: one in relation to the rule of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, in so far as all our actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> should be commensurate with the rule of reason: another order is in relation to the rule of the Divine Law, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be directed in all things: and if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> a solitary animal, this twofold order would suffice. But since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> a civic and social animal, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Polit. i, 2, hence a third order is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed in relation to other men among whom he has to dwell. Of these orders the second contains the first and surpasses it. For whatever things are comprised under the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, are comprised under the order of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. Yet some things are comprised under the order of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which surpass the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, such as matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and things due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Hence he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in such matters, for instance, by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, is said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In like manner, the first order includes the third and surpasses it, because in all things wherein we are directed in reference to our neighbor, we need to be directed according to the order of reason. Yet in some things we are directed according to reason, in relation to ourselves only, and not in reference to our neighbor; and when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in these matters, he is said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against himself, as is seen in the <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">glutton</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a>, and the prodigal. But when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in matters concerning his neighbor, he is said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against his neighbor, as appears in the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> and murderer. Now the things whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his neighbor, and himself are diverse. Wherefore this distinction of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is in respect of their objects, according to which the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are diversified: and consequently this distinction of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is properly one of different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> also, to which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are opposed, differ specifically in respect of these three. For it is evident from what has been said (62, A1,2,3) that by the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; by <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, to himself; and by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to his neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is common to all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in so far as the order to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> includes every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> order; but in so far as order to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> surpasses the other two orders, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When several things, of which one includes another, are distinct from one another, this distinction is understood to refer, not to the part contained in another, but to that in which one goes beyond another. This may be seen in the division of numbers and figures: for a triangle is distinguished from a four-sided figure not in respect of its being contained thereby, but in respect of that in which it is surpassed thereby: and the same applies to the numbers three and four.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor are external to the sinner himself, they are not external to the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but are related to it as to its object.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the division of sins according to their debt of punishment diversifies their species?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the division of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> according to their debt of punishment diversifies their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; for instance, when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is divided into "mortal" and "venial." For things which are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> apart, cannot belong to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, nor even to the same genus. But venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> apart, since temporal punishment is due to venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and the measure of the punishment corresponds to the gravity of the fault, according to <a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>: "According to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall the measure be also of the stripes be." Therefore venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not of the same genus, nor can they be said to belong to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are mortal in virtue of their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> ["Ex genere," genus in this case denoting the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>], as <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; and some are venial in virtue of their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as in an idle word, and excessive laughter. Therefore venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> differ specifically.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act stands in relation to its reward, so does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> stand in relation to punishment. But the reward is the end of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act. Therefore punishment is the end of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> differ specifically in relation to their ends, as stated above (1, ad 1). Therefore they are also specifically distinct according to the debt of punishment.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Those things that constitute a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are prior to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, e.g. specific differences. But punishment follows <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as the effect thereof. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not differ specifically according to the debt of punishment.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In things that differ specifically we find a twofold difference: the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and is not to be found save in different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, e.g. "rational" and "irrational," "animate," and "inanimate": the other difference is consequent to specific diversity; and though, in some cases, it may be consequent to specific diversity, yet, in others, it may be found within the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; thus "white" and "black" are consequent to the specific diversity of crow and swan, and yet this difference is found within the one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>We must therefore say that the difference between venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or any other difference is respect of the debt of punishment, cannot be a difference constituting specific diversity. For what is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> never constitutes a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and what is outside the agent's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> (Phys. ii, text. 50). Now it is evident that punishment is outside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the sinner, wherefore it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> referred to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on the part of the sinner. Nevertheless it is referred to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by an extrinsic principle, viz. the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the judge, who imposes various punishments according to the various manners of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the difference derived from the debt of punishment, may be consequent to the specific diversity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but cannot constitute it.

<p>Now the difference between venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is consequent to the diversity of that inordinateness which constitutes the notion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For inordinateness is twofold, one that destroys the principle of order, and another which, without destroying the principle of order, implies inordinateness in the things which follow the principle: thus, in an animal's body, the frame may be so out of order that the vital principle is destroyed; this is the inordinateness of death; while, on the other hand, saving the vital principle, there may be disorder in the bodily humors; and then there is sickness. Now the principle of the entire moral order is the last end, which stands in the same relation to matters of action, as the indemonstrable principle does to matters of speculation (Ethic. vii, 8). Therefore when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is so disordered by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as to turn away from its last end, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom it is united by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, there is mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but when it is disordered without turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For even as in the body, the disorder of death which results from the destruction of the principle of life, is irreparable according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, while the disorder of sickness can be repaired by reason of the vital principle being preserved, so it is in matters concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Because, in speculative matters, it is impossible to convince one who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> in the principles, whereas one who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>, but retains the principles, can be brought back to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by means of the principles. Likewise in practical matters, he who, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, turns away from his last end, if we consider the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, falls irreparably, and therefore is said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally and to deserve <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>: whereas when a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, his disorder can be repaired, because the principle of the order is not destroyed; wherefore he is said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially, because, to wit, he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> so as to deserve to be punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Mortal and venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> apart as regards what they "turn away from," not as regards what they "turn to," viz. the object which specifies them. Hence nothing hinders the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from including mortal and venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for instance, in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> "<a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>" the first movement is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; while an idle word, which is, generally speaking, venial, may even be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From the fact that one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is mortal by reason of its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and another venial by reason of its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it follows that this difference is consequent to the specific difference of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, not that it is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof. And this difference may be found even in things of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The reward is intended by him that <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or acts virtually; whereas the punishment is not intended by the sinner, but, on the contrary, is against his will. Hence the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether sins of commission and omission differ specifically?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of commission and omission differ specifically. For "offense" and "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" are condivided with one another (<a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse1">Ephesians 2:1</a>), where it is written: "When you were dead in your offenses and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," which words a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains, saying: "'Offenses,' by omitting to do what was commanded, and '<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,' by doing what was forbidden." Whence it is evident that "offenses" here denotes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>; while "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" denotes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of commission. Therefore they differ specifically, since they are contrasted with one another as different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be against <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, for this is part of its definition, as is clear from what has been said (71, 6). Now in <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, the affirmative precepts, against which is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, are different from the negative precepts, against which is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of omission and commission differ specifically.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, omission and commission differ as affirmation and negation. Now affirmation and negation cannot be in the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, since negation has no <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; for "there is neither <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> nor difference of non-being," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Phys. iv, text. 67). Therefore omission and commission cannot belong to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Omission and commission are found in the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> both takes what belongs to others, which is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of commission; and gives not of his own to whom he should give, which is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>. Therefore omission and commission do not differ specifically.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is a twofold difference in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; a material difference and a formal difference: the material difference is to be observed in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act; while the formal difference is gathered from their relation to one proper end, which is also their proper object. Hence we find certain acts differing from one another in the material specific difference, which are nevertheless formally in the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because they are directed to the one same end: thus strangling, stoning, and stabbing come under the one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, although the actions themselves differ specifically according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Accordingly, if we refer to the material <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of omission and commission, they differ specifically, using <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in a broad sense, in so far as negation and privation may have a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But if we refer to the formal <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of omission and commission, they do not differ specifically, because they are directed to the same end, and proceed from the same motive. For the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in order to hoard money, both robs, and omits to give what he ought, and in like manner, the <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">glutton</a>, to satiate his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, both eats too much and omits the prescribed fasts. The same applies to other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: for in things, negation is always founded on affirmation, which, in a manner, is its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence in the physical order it comes under the same head, that fire gives forth heat, and that it does not give forth cold.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This division in respect of commission and <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, is not according to different formal <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but only according to material <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for various affirmative and negative precepts, was that men might be gradually led to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, first by abstaining from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, being induced to this by the negative precepts, and afterwards by doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to which we are induced by the affirmative precepts. Wherefore the affirmative and negative precepts do not belong to different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but to different degrees of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and consequently they are not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, opposed to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Moreover <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not specified by that from which it turns away, because in this respect it is a negation or privation, but by that to which it turns, in so far as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an act. Consequently <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not differ specifically according to the various precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This objection considers the material diversity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. It must be observed, however, that although, properly speaking, negation is not in a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, yet it is allotted to a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by reduction to the affirmation on which it is based.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether sins are fittingly divided into sins of thought, word, and deed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are unfittingly divided into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of thought, word, and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xii, 12) describes three stages of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, of which the first is "when the carnal sense offers a bait," which is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of thought; the second stage is reached "when one is satisfied with the mere pleasure of thought"; and the third stage, "when consent is given to the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>." Now these three belong to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of thought. Therefore it is unfitting to reckon <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of thought as one kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. iv, 25) reckons four degrees of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; the first of which is "a fault hidden in the heart"; the second, "when it is done openly"; the third, "when it is formed into a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>"; and the fourth, "when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> goes so far as to presume on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy or to give himself up to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>": where no distinction is made between <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of word, and two other degrees of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are added. Therefore the first division was unfitting.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there can be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> unless there precede <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of thought. Therefore these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not differ specifically. Therefore they should not be condivided with one another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> in commenting on <a href="../bible/eze043.htm#verse23">Ezekiel 43:23</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is subject to three kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for when we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is either by thought, or word, or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Things differ specifically in two ways: first, when each has the complete <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; thus a horse and an ox differ specifically: secondly, when the diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is derived from diversity of degree in generation or movement: thus the building is the complete generation of a house, while the laying of the foundations, and the setting up of the walls are incomplete <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. x, 4); and the same can apply to the generation of animals. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are divided into these three, viz. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of thought, word, and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, not as into various complete <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: for the consummation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, wherefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> have the complete <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; but the first beginning of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is its foundation, as it were, in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of thought; the second degree is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of word, in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ready to break out into a declaration of his thought; while the third degree consists in the consummation of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Consequently these three differ in respect of the various degrees of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nevertheless it is evident that these three belong to the one complete <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since they proceed from the same motive. For the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, through desire of vengeance, is at first disturbed in thought, then he breaks out into words of abuse, and lastly he goes on to wrongful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; and the same applies to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and to any other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of thought have the common note of secrecy, in respect of which they form one degree, which is, however, divided into three stages, viz. of cogitation, pleasure, and consent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sins</a> of words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> are both done openly, and for this reason <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. iv, 25) reckons them under one head: whereas <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (in <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/eze043.htm#verse23">Ezekiel 43:23</a>) distinguishes between them, because in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of word there is nothing but manifestation which is intended principally; while in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, it is the consummation of the inward thought which is principally intended, and the outward manifestation is by way of sequel. Habit and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> are stages following the complete <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even as boyhood and youth follow the complete generation of a man.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sin of thought and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of word are not distinct from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> when they are united together with it, but when each is found by itself: even as one part of a movement is not distinct from the whole movement, when the movement is continuous, but only when there is a break in the movement.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether excess and deficiency diversify the species of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that excess and deficiency do not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For excess and deficiency differ in respect of more and less. Now "more" and "less" do not diversify a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore excess and deficiency do not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in matters of action, is due to straying from the rectitude of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, so falsehood, in speculative matters, is due to straying from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the reality. Now the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of falsehood is not diversified by saying more or less than the reality. Therefore neither is the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> diversified by straying more or less from the rectitude of reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cannot be made out of two," as Porphyry declares [Isagog.; cf. Arist. Metaph. i]. Now excess and deficiency are united in one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for some are at once illiberal and wasteful--illiberality being a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of deficiency, and prodigality, by excess. Therefore excess and deficiency do not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Contraries differ specifically, for "contrariety is a difference of form," as stated in Metaph. x, text. 13,14. Now <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> that differ according to excess and deficiency are contrary to one another, as illiberality to wastefulness. Therefore they differ specifically.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> While there are two things in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, viz. the act itself and its inordinateness, in so far as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a departure from the order of reason and the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is gathered, not from its inordinateness, which is outside the sinner's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), but on the contrary, from the act itself as terminating in the object to which the sinner's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is directed. Consequently wherever we find a different motive inclining the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there will be a different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it is evident that the motive for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by excess, is not the same as the motive for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of deficiency; in fact, they are contrary to one another, just as the motive in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of intemperance is love for bodily pleasures, while the motive in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of insensibility is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the same. Therefore these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not only differ specifically, but are contrary to one another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although "more" and "less" do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, yet they are sometimes consequent to specific difference, in so far as they are the result of diversity of form; thus we may say that fire is lighter than air. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 1) that "those who held that there are no different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of friendship, by reason of its admitting of degree, were led by insufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>." In this way to exceed reason or to fall short thereof belongs to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> specifically different, in so far as they result from different motives.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not the sinner's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to depart from reason; and so <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of excess and deficiency do not become of one kind through departing from the one rectitude of reason. On the other hand, sometimes he who utters a falsehood, intends to hide the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, wherefore in this respect, it matters not whether he tells more or less. If, however, departure from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be not outside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, it is evident that then one is moved by different <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to tell more or less; and in this respect there are different kinds of falsehood, as is evident of the "boaster," who exceeds in telling untruths for the sake of fame, and the "cheat," who tells less than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in order to escape from paying his debts. This also explains how some <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinions are contrary to one another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One may be prodigal and illiberal with regard to different objects: for instance one may be illiberal [Cf. II-II, 119, 1, ad 1 in taking what one ought not: and nothing hinders contraries from being in the same subject, in different respects.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether sins differ specifically in respect of different circumstances?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> differ in respect of different circumstances. For, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv), "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> results from each single defect." Now <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> defects are corruptions of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> circumstances. Therefore from the corruption of each circumstance there results a corresponding <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> sometimes take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from circumstances, as stated above (Question 18, Article 10). Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> differ specifically according as different circumstances are corrupted.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, diverse <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are assigned to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, according to the words contained in the following verse: 'Hastily, sumptuously, too much, greedily, daintily.' Now these pertain to various circumstances, for "hastily" means sooner than is right; "too much," more than is right, and so on with the others. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is diversified according to the various circumstances.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 7; iv, 1) that "every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by doing more than one ought, and when one ought not"; and in like manner as to the other circumstances. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not diversified in this respect.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>), wherever there is a special motive for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, there is a different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because the motive for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> is the end and object of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it happens sometimes that although different circumstances are corrupted, there is but one motive: thus the illiberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for the same motive, takes when he ought not, where he ought not, and more than he ought, and so on with the circumstances, since he does this through an inordinate desire of hoarding money: and in such cases the corruption of different circumstances does not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but belongs to one and the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>Sometimes, however, the corruption of different circumstances arises from different motives: for instance that a man eat hastily, may be due to the fact that he cannot brook the delay in taking food, on account of a rapid exhaustion of the digestive humors; and that he desire too much food, may be due to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> strong digestion; that he desire choice meats, is due to his desire for pleasure in taking food. Hence in such matters, the corruption of different circumstances entails different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a>, as such, is a privation, and so it has different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in respect of the thing which the subject is deprived, even as other privations. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not take its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the privation or aversion, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), but from turning to the object of the act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A circumstance never transfers an act from one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to another, save when there is another motive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> there are various motives, as stated.
