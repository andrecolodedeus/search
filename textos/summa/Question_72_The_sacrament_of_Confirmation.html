<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether confirmation is a sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that Confirmation is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> derive their efficacy from the Divine institution, as stated above (Question 64, Article 2). But we read nowhere of Confirmation being instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> were foreshadowed in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>; thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 10:2-4</a>), that "all in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, in the cloud and in the sea; and did all eat the same <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food, and all drank the same <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> drink." But Confirmation was not foreshadowed in the old Testament. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are ordained unto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be saved without Confirmation: since children that are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, who die before being confirmed, are saved. Therefore Confirmation is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, by all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is the Author of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by Confirmation, since we read nowhere of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> being confirmed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Melchiades wrote to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Spain: "Concerning the point on which you sought to be informed, i.e. whether the imposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hand were a greater sacrament than <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that each is a great sacrament."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are ordained unto special effects of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: and therefore where there is a special effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, there we find a special sacrament ordained for the purpose. But since sensible and material things bear a likeness to things <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and intelligible, from what occurs in the life of the body, we can perceive that which is special to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life. Now it is evident that in the life of the body a certain special perfection consists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> attaining to the perfect age, and being able to perform the perfect actions of a man: hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 13:11</a>): "When I became a man, I put away the things of a child." And thence it is that besides the movement of generation whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives life of the body, there is the movement of growth, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is brought to the perfect age. So therefore does <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receive <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration: while in Confirmation <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> arrives at the perfect age, as it were, of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life. Hence Pope Melchiades says: "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who comes down on the waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> bearing <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in His flight, bestows at the font, the fulness of innocence; but in Confirmation He confers an increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. In <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> we are born again unto life; after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> we are strengthened." And therefore it is evident that Confirmation is a special sacrament.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Concerning the institution of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> there are three opinions. Some (<a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, Summa Theol. P. IV, Q. IX; St. Bonaventure, Sent. iv, D, 7) have maintained that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was instituted neither by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; but later in the course of time by one of the councils. Others (Pierre de Tarentaise, Sent. iv, D, 7) held that it was instituted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. But this cannot be admitted; since the institution of a new sacrament belongs to the power of excellence, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone.

<p>And therefore we must say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> instituted this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> not by bestowing, but by promising it, according to <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse7">John 16:7</a>: "If I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you, but if I go, I will send Him to you." And this was because in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is bestowed, which was not to be given before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> and <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>; according to <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse39">John 7:39</a>: "As yet the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> was not given, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not yet glorified."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Confirmation is the sacrament of the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: wherefore there could be nothing corresponding to it in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, since "the Law brought nothing to perfection" (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse19">Hebrews 7:19</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 65, Article 4), all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are in some way <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: but some, so that there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> without them; some as conducing to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and thus it is that Confirmation is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: although <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is possible without it, provided it be not omitted out of contempt.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Those who receive Confirmation, which is the sacrament of the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, are conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, inasmuch as from the very first instant of His conception He was "full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>). This fulness was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, when "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended in a bodily shape . . . upon Him" (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse22">Luke 3:22</a>). Hence (<a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse1">Luke 4:1</a>) it is written that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, returned from the Jordan." Nor was it fitting to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> dignity, that He, Who is the Author of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, should receive the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether chrism is a fitting matter for this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that chrism is not a fitting <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (1, ad 1), was instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when He promised His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But He sent them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> without their being anointed with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves bestowed this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> without <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, by the mere imposition of hands: for it is written (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse17">Acts 8:17</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> "laid their hands upon" those who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, "and they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore chrism is not the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Confirmation perfects, in a way, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>, as stated above (65, 3-4): and so it ought to be conformed to it as perfection to the thing perfected. But the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, is a simple element, viz. water. Therefore <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, which is made of oil and balm, is not a fitting <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, oil is used as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> for the purpose of anointing. But any oil will do for anointing: for instance, oil made from nuts, and from anything else. Therefore not only olive oil should be used for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it has been stated above (Question 66, Article 3) that water is used as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, because it is easily procured everywhere. But olive oil is not to be procured everywhere; and much less is balm. Therefore <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, which is made of these, is not a fitting <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Registr. iv): "Let no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> dare to sign the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> infants on the brow with the sacred <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>." Therefore chrism is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Chrism is the fitting <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is given for the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> strength which belongs to the perfect age. Now when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> comes to perfect age he begins at once to have intercourse with others; whereas until then he lives an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> life, as it were, confined to himself. Now the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is signified by oil; hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be "anointed with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">gladness</a>" (<a href="../bible/psa044.htm#verse8">Psalm 44:8</a>), by reason of His being gifted with the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Consequently oil is a suitable <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And balm is mixed with the oil, by reason of its fragrant odor, which spreads about: hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse15">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>): "We are the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> odor of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," etc. And though many other things be fragrant, yet preference is given to balm, because it has a special odor of its own, and because it confers incorruptibility: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse21">Sirach 24:21</a>): "My odor is as the purest balm."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by the power which He exercises in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> the reality of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, i.e. the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, without the sacrament itself, because they had received "the first fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse23">Romans 8:23</a>). Nevertheless, something of keeping with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was displayed to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in a sensible manner when they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came down upon them in a sensible manner under the form of fire, refers to the same signification as oil: except in so far as fire has an active power, while oil has a passive power, as being the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and incentive of fire. And this was quite fitting: for it was through the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was to flow forth to others. Again, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came down on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in the shape of a tongue. Which refers to the same signification as balm: except in so far as the tongue communicates with others by speech, but balm, by its odor. because, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as teachers of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>; but the rest of the believers, as doing that which gives edification to the faithful.

<p>In like manner, too, when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> imposed their hands, and when they preached, the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came down under visible signs on the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, just as, at the beginning, He came down on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: hence Peter said (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse15">Acts 11:15</a>): "When I had begun to speak, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> fell upon them, as upon us also in the beginning." Consequently there was no need for sacramental sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent sensible signs <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>.

<p>However, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> commonly made use of chrism in bestowing the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, when such like visible signs were lacking. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iv): "There is a certain perfecting operation which our guides," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, "call the sacrifice of Chrism."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is bestowed that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life may be received simply; wherefore simple <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is fitting to it. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given that we may receive the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Whose operations are manifold, according to <a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse22">Wisdom 7:22</a>, "In her is the" Holy "Spirit . . . one, manifold"; and <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 12:4</a>, "There are diversities of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, but the same Spirit." Consequently a compound <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is appropriate to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These properties of oil, by reason of which it symbolizes the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, are to be found in olive oil rather than in any other oil. In fact, the olive-tree itself, through being an evergreen, signifies the refreshing and merciful operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p>Moreover, this oil is called oil properly, and is very much in use, wherever it is to be had. And whatever other liquid is so called, derives its name from its likeness to this oil: nor are the latter commonly used, unless it be to supply the want of olive oil. Therefore it is that this oil alone is used for this and certain other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the sacrament of absolute <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; and so its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> should be at hand everywhere. But it is enough that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which is not of such great <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, be easily sent to all parts of the world.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it is essential to this sacrament that the chrism which is its matter be previously consecrated by a bishop?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, which is its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, be previously <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> which bestows full remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is not less efficacious than this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But, though the baptismal water receives a kind of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> before being used for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; yet this is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the sacrament: since in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> it can be dispensed with. Therefore neither is it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that the chrism should be previously <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the same should not be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> twice. But the sacramental <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is sanctified, in the very conferring of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, by the form of words wherein the sacrament is bestowed; hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.): "The word is added to the element, and this becomes a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>." Therefore the chrism should not be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> before this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> employed in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is ordained to the bestowal of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But the sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> composed of oil and balm is not receptive of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore it should not be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a> says (Ep. ad Decent.): "Priests, when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, may anoint the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, previously <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>: but they must not sign the brow with the same oil; this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone, when he gives the Paraclete." Now this is done in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> be previously <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The entire sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is derived from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as stated above (Question 64, Article 3). But it must be observed that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did use certain <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> having a corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and also the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. And consequently, from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> very act in using them, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> received a certain aptitude to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Chromatius, In Matth. 3:15) says that "the waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> could never wash away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of believers, had they not been sanctified by contact with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> body." And again, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself "taking bread . . . blessed . . . and in like manner the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse26">Matthew 26:26-27</a>; <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse19">Luke 22:19-20</a>). For this reason there is no need for the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to be blessed previously, since Christ's <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> is enough. And if any <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> be used, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not make use of visible anointings, so as not to slight the invisible unction whereby He was "anointed above" His "fellows" (<a href="../bible/psa044.htm#verse8">Psalm 44:8</a>). And hence both <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil, and the oil of the sick are blessed before being put to sacramental use. This suffices for the reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Each <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the chrism has not the same object. For just as an instrument derives instrumental power in two ways, viz. when it receives the form of an instrument, and when it is moved by the principal agent; so too the sacramental <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> needs a twofold sanctification, by one of which it becomes fit <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, while by the other it is applied to the production of the effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is receptive of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not so as to be the subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but only as the instrument of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as explained above (Question 62, Article 3). And this sacramental <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, either by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, impersonates <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the proper form of this sacrament is: "I sign thee with the sign of the cross," etc.?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the proper form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not: "I sign thee with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, I confirm thee with the chrism of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." For the use of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is derived from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. But neither did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> institute this form, nor do we read of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> making use of it. Therefore it is not the proper form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as the sacrament is the same everywhere, so should the form be the same: because everything has unity, just as it has being, from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But this form is not used by all: for some say: "I confirm thee with the chrism of sanctification." Therefore the above is not the proper form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should be conformed to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as the perfect to the thing perfected, as stated above (2, Objection 2). But in the form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> no mention is made of signing the character; nor again of the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, though in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> dies with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans 6:3-8</a>); nor of the effect which is <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, though <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Again, in the baptismal form, only one action is included; and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the baptizer is expressed in the words: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee, whereas the contrary is to be observed in the above form." Therefore this is not the proper form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Is the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who always uses this form.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The above form is appropriate to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For just as the form of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing gives it its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, so a sacramental form should contain whatever belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now as is evident from what has been already said (1-2), in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is given for strength in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> combat. Wherefore in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> three things are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; and they are contained in the above form. The first of these is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> conferring fulness of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> strength which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the Blessed <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>: and this is expressed in the words, "In the name of the Father," etc. The second is the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> strength itself bestowed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by the sacrament of visible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and this is referred to in the words, "I confirm thee with the chrism of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>." The third is the sign which is given to the combatant, as in a bodily combat: thus are soldiers marked with the sign of their leaders. And to this refer the words, "I sign thee with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>," in which sign, to wit, our King triumphed (cf. <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse15">Colossians 2:15</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (2, ad 1), sometimes the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, i.e. the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, was given through the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, under certain visible signs, wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who can bestow the sacramental effect, independently of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. In these cases there was no need for either the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. On the other hand, sometimes they bestowed this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as ministers of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. And then, they used both <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> command. For the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in conferring the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, observed many things which are not handed down in those <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that are in general use. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says at the end of his treatise on the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy (chap. vii): "It is not allowed to explain in writing the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which are used in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and to publish their mystical meaning, or the power which, coming from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, gives them their efficacy; we learn these things by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> tradition without any display,"* i.e. secretly. [The passage quoted in the text of the Summa differs slightly from the above, which is translated directly from the works of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>.] Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, speaking of the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, writes (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse34">1 Corinthians 11:34</a>): "The rest I will set in order, when I come."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Holiness is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Therefore it comes to the same whether we say "chrism of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>" or "of sanctification."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the regeneration unto the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lives in himself. And therefore in the baptismal form that action alone is expressed which refers to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be sanctified. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is ordained not only to the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in himself, but also to strengthen him in his outward combat. Consequently not only is mention made of interior sanctification, in the words, "I confirm thee with the chrism of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>": but furthermore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is signed outwardly, as it were with the standard of the cross, unto the outward <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> combat; and this is signified by the words, "I sign thee with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>."

<p>But in the very word "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>," which signifies "to cleanse," we can understand both the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is the cleansing water, and the effect, which is <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Whereas these are not understood by the word "confirm"; and consequently they had to be expressed.

<p>Again, it has been said above (66, 5, ad 1) that the pronoun "I" is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the Baptismal form, because it is included in the first <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the verb. It is, however, included in order to express the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. But this does not seem so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in Confirmation, which is conferred only by a minister of excellence, as we shall state later on (11).

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the sacrament of Confirmation imprints a character?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a> does not imprint a character. For a character means a distinctive sign. But a man is not distinguished from unbelievers by the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a>, for this is the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; nor from the rest of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, because this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is ordained to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> combat, which is enjoined to all the faithful. Therefore a character is not imprinted in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it was stated above (Question 63, Article 2) that a character is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power. Now a power must be either active or passive. But the active power in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is conferred by the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a>: while the passive or receptive power is conferred by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>. Therefore no character is imprinted by the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which is a character of the body, no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> character is imprinted. But in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> a character is imprinted on the body, when the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> is signed with chrism on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> brow. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> character is not imprinted by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A character is imprinted in every sacrament that is not repeated. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not repeated: for Gregory II says (Ep. iv ad Bonifac.): "As to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was confirmed a second time by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, such a repetition must be forbidden." Therefore a character is imprinted in Confirmation.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 63, Article 2), a character is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power ordained to certain sacred actions. Now it has been said above (1; 65, 1) that, just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration unto <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, so also is Confirmation a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> growth bringing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to perfect <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> age. But it is evident, from a comparison with the life of the body, that the action which is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> immediately after birth, is different from the action which is proper to him when he has come to perfect age. And therefore by the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is given a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power in respect of sacred actions other than those in respect of which he receives power in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> he receives power to do those things which pertain to his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, forasmuch as he lives to himself: whereas in Confirmation he receives power to do those things which pertain to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> combat with the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. This is evident from the example of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who, before they received the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, were in the "upper room . . . persevering . . . in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>" (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse13">Acts 1:13-14</a>); whereas afterwards they went out and feared not to confess their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in public, even in the face of the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. And therefore it is evident that a character is imprinted in the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All have to wage the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> combat with our invisible enemies. But to fight against visible foes, viz. against the persecutors of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, by confessing Christ's name, belongs to the confirmed, who have already come spiritually to the age of virility, according to <a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse14">1 John 2:14</a>: "I write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abideth in you, and you have overcome the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one." And therefore the character of Confirmation is a distinctive sign, not between unbelievers and believers, but between those who are grown up spiritually and those of whom it is written: "As new-born babes" (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse2">1 Peter 2:2</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are protestations of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore just as he who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> receives the power of testifying to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by receiving the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; so he who is confirmed receives the power of publicly confessing his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by words, as it were "ex officio."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> are called "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the flesh" (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse10">Hebrews 9:10</a>) because, to wit, they wrought nothing inwardly. Consequently in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> a character was imprinted in the body only, but not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But in Confirmation, since it is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">spiritual character</a> is imprinted at the same time, together with the bodily character.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the character of Confirmation presupposes of necessity, the baptismal character?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the character of Confirmation does not presuppose, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, the baptismal character. For the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a> is ordained to the public confession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But many, even before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, have publicly confessed the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by shedding their blood for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Therefore the character of Confirmation does not presuppose the baptismal character.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is not related of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> that they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; especially, since it is written (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse2">John 4:2</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "Himself did not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, but His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>." Yet afterwards they were confirmed by the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore, in like manner, others can be confirmed before being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse44">Acts 10:44-48</a>) that "while Peter was yet speaking . . . the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> fell on all them that heard the word . . . and [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'for'] they heard them speaking with tongues": and afterwards "he commanded them to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." Therefore others with equal reason can be confirmed before being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus</a> says (De Instit. Cleric. i): "Lastly the Paraclete is given to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the imposition of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest's</a> hands, in order that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> may be strengthened by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> so as to publish his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The character of Confirmation, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> supposes the baptismal character: so that, in effect, if one who is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> were to be confirmed, he would receive nothing, but would have to be confirmed again after receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. The reason of this is that, Confirmation is to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> as growth to birth, as is evident from what has been said above (1; 65, 1). Now it is clear that no one can be brought to perfect age unless he be first born: and in like manner, unless a man be first <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, he cannot receive the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Divine power is not confined to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can receive <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> strength to confess the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> publicly, without receiving the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a>: just as he can also receive remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Yet, just as none receive the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> without the desire of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; so none receive the effect of Confirmation, without the desire of Confirmation. And <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can have this even before receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. cclxv), from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> words, "'He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his feet' (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse10">John 13:10</a>), we gather that Peter and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> other <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, either with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as some think; or with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>, which is more credible. For He did not refuse to administer <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, so as to have servants by whom to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> others."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who heard the preaching of Peter received the effect of Confirmation <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>: but not the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a>. Now it has been stated (ad 1) that the effect of Confirmation can be bestowed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, whereas the sacrament cannot. For just as the effect of Confirmation, which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> strength, presupposes the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a> presupposes the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether sanctifying grace is bestowed in this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is not bestowed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is ordained against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>) is given only to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, who are cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is not bestowed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sinners especially need <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, by which alone can they be justified. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is bestowed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it seems that it should be given to those who are in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And yet this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there can only be one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, since it is ordained to one effect. But two forms of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cannot be in the same subject. Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is not bestowed in Confirmation, which is given to none but the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Melchiades says (Ep. ad Episc. Hispan.): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> bestows at the font the fulness of innocence; but in Confirmation He confers an increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (1 and 4), the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is given to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for strength: just as He was given to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> on the day of Pentecost, as we read in <a href="../bible/act002.htm">Acts 2</a>; and just as He was given to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the imposition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> hands, as related in <a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse17">Acts 8:17</a>. Now it has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in I, 43, 3 that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not sent or given except with <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Consequently it is evident that <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is bestowed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sanctifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does indeed take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but it has other effects also, because it suffices to carry <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through every step as far as <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. Hence to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was it said (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>): "My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for thee": and he says of himself (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>): "By the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> I am what I am." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is given not only for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also for growth and stability in righteousness. And thus is it bestowed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Further, as appears from its very name, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given in order "to confirm" what it finds already there. And consequently it should not be given to those who are not in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>. For this reason, just as it is not given to the unbaptized, so neither should it be given to the adult sinners, except they be restored by Penance. Wherefore was it decreed in the Council of Orleans (Can. iii) that "men should come to Confirmation <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>; and should be admonished to confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> first, so that being cleansed they may be able to receive the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." And then this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> perfects the effects of Penance, as of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: because by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which he has received in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, the penitent will obtain fuller remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And if any adult approach, being in a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which he is not conscious or for which he is not perfectly <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a>, he will receive the remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 62, Article 2), the sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> adds to the <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> taken in its wide sense, something that produces a special effect, and to which the sacrament is ordained. If, then, we consider, in its wide sense, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it does not differ from that bestowed in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, but increases what was already there. On the other hand, if we consider it as to that which is added over and above, then one differs in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the other.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether this sacrament should be given to all?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should not be given to all. For this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given in order to confer a certain excellence, as stated above (11, ad 2). But all are not suited for that which belongs to excellence. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should not be given to all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> advances spiritually to perfect age. But perfect age is inconsistent with childhood. Therefore at least it should not be given to children.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as Pope Melchiades says (Ep. ad Episc. Hispan.) "after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> we are strengthened for the combat." But <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are incompetent to combat, by reason of the frailty of their sex. Therefore neither should <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, Pope Melchiades says (Ep. ad Episc. Hispan.): "Although the benefit of Regeneration suffices for those who are on the point of death, yet the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of Confirmation are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for those who are to conquer. Confirmation arms and strengthens those to whom the struggles and combats of this world are reserved. And he who comes to die, having kept unsullied the innocence he acquired in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, is confirmed by death; for after death he can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more." Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should not be given to those who are on the point of death: and so it should not be given to all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse2">Acts 2:2</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in coming, "filled the whole house," whereby the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is signified; and afterwards it is added that "they were all filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given that we may receive that fulness. Therefore it should be given to all who belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is spiritually advanced by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to perfect age. Now the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is that everyone born corporally, should come to perfect age: yet this is sometimes hindered by reason of the corruptibility of the body, which is forestalled by death. But much more is it <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to bring all things to perfection, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> shares in this <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> inasmuch as it reflects Him: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>): "The works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are perfect." Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> birth and perfect <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> age belong, is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; and just as it can in old age attain to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> birth, so can it attain to perfect (<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>) age in youth or childhood; because the various ages of the body do not affect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should be given to all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This sacrament is given in order to confer a certain excellence, not indeed, like the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a>, of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> over another, but of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in regard to himself: thus the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when arrived at maturity, excels himself as he was when a boy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above, the age of the body does not affect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently even in childhood <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can attain to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> age, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/wis004.htm#verse8">Wisdom 4:8</a>): "Venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years." And hence it is that many children, by reason of the strength of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which they had received, fought bravely for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> even to the shedding of their blood.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. i De Machab.), "in earthly contests fitness of age, physique and rank are required; and consequently slaves, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, old men, and boys are debarred from taking part therein. But in the heavenly combats, the Stadium is open equally to all, to every age, and to either sex." Again, he says (Hom. de Militia Spirit.): "In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> eyes even <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> fight, for many a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has waged the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> warfare with the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of a man. For some have rivaled men in the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> with which they have suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>; and some indeed have shown themselves stronger than men." Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should be given to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As we have already observed, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> age belongs, is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. Wherefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should be given to those on the point of death, that they may be seen to be perfect at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians 4:13</a>: "Until we all meet into the unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . unto the measure of the age of the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." And hence <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> says (De Sacram. ii), "It would be altogether hazardous, if anyone happened to go forth from this life without being confirmed": not that such a one would be lost, except perhaps through contempt; but that this would be detrimental to his perfection. And therefore even children dying after Confirmation obtain greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, just as here below they receive more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. The passage quoted is to be taken in the sense that, with regard to the dangers of the present combat, those who are on the point of death do not need this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether this sacrament should be given to man on the forehead?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should not be given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the forehead. For this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> perfects <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as stated above (65, 3-4). But the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> over his whole body. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should not be given on the forehead only.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> strength, as stated above (1-2-4). But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> strength is situated principally in the heart. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should be given over the heart rather than on the forehead.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that he may freely confess the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But "with the mouth, confession is made unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>," according to <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse10">Romans 10:10</a>. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should be given about the mouth rather than on the forehead.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus</a> says (De Instit. Cleric. i): "The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is signed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> with chrism on the top of the head, but by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on the forehead."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1 and 4), in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> for strength in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> combat, that he may bravely confess the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> even in face of the enemies of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Wherefore he is fittingly signed with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> on the forehead, with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, for two reasons. First, because he is signed with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, as a soldier with the sign of his leader, which should be evident and manifest. Now, the forehead, which is hardly ever covered, is the most conspicuous part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. Wherefore the confirmed is anointed with chrism on the forehead, that he may show publicly that he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>: thus too the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> after receiving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> showed themselves in public, whereas before they remained hidden in the upper room.

<p>Secondly, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is hindered from freely confessing Christ's name, by two things--by fear and by shame. Now both these things betray themselves principally on the forehead on account of the proximity of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and because the (vital) spirits mount directly from the heart to the forehead: hence "those who are ashamed, blush, and those who are afraid, pale" (Ethic. iv). And therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is signed with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, that neither fear nor shame may hinder him from confessing the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> we are regenerated unto <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, which belongs to the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But in Confirmation we are strengthened for the combat; the sign of which should be borne on the forehead, as in a conspicuous place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The principle of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is in the heart, but its sign appears on the forehead: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/eze003.htm#verse8">Ezekiel 3:8</a>): "Behold I have made . . . thy forehead harder than their foreheads." Hence the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is confirmed in himself, belongs to the heart, according to <a href="../bible/psa103.htm#verse15">Psalm 103:15</a>: "That bread may strengthen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart." But the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a> is required as a sign of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> against others; and for this reason it is given on the forehead.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This sacrament is given that we may confess freely: but not that we may confess simply, for this is also the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. And therefore it should not be given on the mouth, but on the forehead, where appear the signs of those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which hinder free confession.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether he who is confirmed needs one to stand for him?</h2> <span class="stiki">Stand: Literally, "to hold him"</span>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that he who is confirmed needs no one to stand for him. For this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given not only to children but also to adults. But adults can stand for themselves. Therefore it is absurd that someone else should stand for them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he that belongs already to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has free access to the prince of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>), is given only to one that is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, who is already a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore it seems that he should not be brought by another to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in order to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> strength, which has more vigor in men than in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro031.htm#verse10">Proverbs 31:10</a>: "Who shall find a valiant <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>?" Therefore at least a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should not stand for a man in confirmation.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Are the following words of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent</a>, which are to be found in the Decretals (XXX, 4): "If anyone raise the children of another's marriage from the sacred font, or stand for them in Confirmation," etc. Therefore, just as someone is required as sponsor of one who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, so is someone required to stand for him who is to be confirmed.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1-4-9), this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for strength in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> combat. Now, just as one newly born requires someone to teach him things pertaining to ordinary conduct, according to <a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse9">Hebrews 12:9</a>: "We have had fathers of our flesh, for instructors, and we obeyed [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'reverenced']" them; so they who are chosen for the fight need instructors by whom they are informed of things concerning the conduct of the battle, and hence in earthly <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, generals and captains are appointed to the command of the others. For this reason he also who receives this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, has someone to stand for him, who, as it were, has to instruct him concerning the fight.

<p>Likewise, since this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> bestows on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the perfection of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> age, as stated above (2 and 5), therefore he who approaches this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is upheld by another, as being spiritually a weakling and a child.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although he who is confirmed, be adult in body, nevertheless he is not yet spiritually adult.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Though he who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is made a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, nevertheless he is not yet enrolled as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> soldier. And therefore he is brought to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as to the commander of the army, by one who is already enrolled as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> soldier. For one who is not yet confirmed should not stand for another in Confirmation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to <a href="../bible/col003.htm">Colossians 3</a> (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse28">Galatians 3:28</a>), "in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> there is neither male nor female." Consequently it matters not whether a man or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> stand for one who is to be confirmed.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether only a bishop can confer this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that not only a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can confer this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Regist. iv), writing to Bishop Januarius, says: "We hear that some were scandalized because we forbade <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to anoint with chrism those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Yet in doing this we followed the ancient custom of our Church: but if this trouble some so very much we permit <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, where no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to be had, to anoint the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> on the forehead with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>." But that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> should not be changed for the purpose of avoiding <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Therefore it seems that it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that it be conferred by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> seems to be more efficacious than the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a>: since it bestows full remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, both as to guilt and as to punishment, whereas this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not. But a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in virtue of his office, can give the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>: and in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> anyone, even without orders, can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that it be conferred by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the top of the head, where according to medical men the reason is situated (i.e. the "particular reason," which is called the "cogitative faculty"), is more noble than the forehead, which is the site of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. But a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can anoint the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with chrism on the top of the head. Therefore much more can he anoint them with chrism on the forehead, which belongs to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Eusebius (Ep. iii ad Ep. Tusc.) says: "The sacrament of the imposition of the hand should be held in great veneration, and can be given by none but the high <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Nor is it related or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have been conferred in apostolic times by others than the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves; nor can it ever be either licitly or validly performed by others than those who stand in their place. And if anyone presume to do otherwise, it must be considered null and void; nor will such a thing ever be counted among the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which is called "the sacrament of the imposition of the hand," that it be given by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In every work the final completion is reserved to the supreme act or power; thus the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> belongs to the lower craftsmen, the higher gives the form, but the highest of all is he to whom pertains the use, which is the end of things made by art; thus also the letter which is written by the clerk, is signed by his employer. Now the faithful of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are a Divine work, according to <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>: "You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> building"; and they are also "an epistle," as it were, "written with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>," according to <a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse2">2 Corinthians 3:2-3</a>. And this <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a> is, as it were, the final completion of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>; in the sense that by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is built up into a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> dwelling, and is written like a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> letter; whereas by the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a>, like a house already built, he is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as a temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and as a letter already written, is signed with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>. Therefore the conferring of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is reserved to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who possess supreme power in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: just as in the primitive Church, the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was given by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in whose place the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> stand (<a href="../bible/act008.htm">Acts 8</a>). Hence Pope Urban I says: "All the faithful should. after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by the imposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hand, that they may become perfect <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Pope has the plenitude of power in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in virtue of which he can commit to certain lower orders things that belong to the higher orders: thus he allows <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to confer <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, which belong to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power. And in virtue of this fulness of power the Pope, Blessed Gregory, allowed simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to confer this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, so long as the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> was ended.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is more efficacious than this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as to the removal of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since it is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> birth, that consists in change from non-being to being. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is more efficacious for progress in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; since it is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> growth from imperfect being to perfect being. And hence this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is committed to a more worthy minister.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus</a> says (De Instit. Cleric. i), "the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is signed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> with chrism on the top of the head, but by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on the forehead; that the former unction may symbolize the descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> on hint, in order to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a dwelling to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and that the second also may teach us that the sevenfold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descends on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with all fulness of sanctity, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Hence this unction is reserved to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, not on account of its being applied to a more worthy part of the body, but by reason of its having a more powerful effect.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether the rite of this sacrament is appropriate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the rite of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not appropriate. For the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is of greater <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> than this, as stated above (2, ad 4; 65, 3 and 4). But certain seasons are fixed for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and Pentecost. Therefore some fixed time of the year should be chosen for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> requires devotion both in the giver and in the receiver, so also does the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that it should be received or given <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. Therefore it seems unfitting for the Council of Orleans to declare that "those who come to Confirmation should be <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>"; and the Council of Meaux, "that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should not give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> with imposition of the hand except they be <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, chrism is a sign of the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). But the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was given to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> faithful on the day of Pentecost, as related in <a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse1">Acts 2:1</a>. Therefore the chrism should be mixed and blessed on the day of Pentecost rather than on Maundy Thursday.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Is the use of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who is governed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> promised His faithful (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse20">Matthew 18:20</a>) saying: "Where there are two or three gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them." And therefore we must hold firmly that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ordinations are directed by the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And for this reason we must look upon it as certain that the rite observed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in this and the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, is appropriate.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As Pope Melchiades says (Ep. ad Epis. Hispan.), "these two <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>," viz. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and Confirmation, "are so closely connected that they can nowise be separated save by death intervening, nor can one be duly celebrated without the other." Consequently the same seasons are fixed for the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> celebration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But since this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given only by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who are not always present where <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as regards the common use, to defer the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a> to other seasons also.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The sick and those in danger of death are exempt from this prohibition, as we read in the decree of the Council of Meaux. And therefore, on account of the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and on account of imminent dangers, it is allowed for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which can be given by none but a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to be given or received even by those who are not <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>: since one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, especially in a large diocese, would not suffice to confirm all, if he were confined to certain times. But where it can be done conveniently, it is more becoming that both giver and receiver should be <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to the acts of the Council of Pope Martin, "it was lawful at all times to prepare the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>." But since <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, for which chrism has to be used, is celebrated on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Eve, it was rightly decreed, that chrism should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> two days beforehand, that it may be sent to the various parts of the diocese. Moreover, this day is sufficiently appropriate to the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of sacramental <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since thereon was the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> instituted, to which, in a certain way, all the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are ordained, as stated above (Question 65, Article 3).
