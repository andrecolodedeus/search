<h1>Question 73. Backbiting</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3073.htm#article1"> What is backbiting?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3073.htm#article2"> Is it a mortal sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3073.htm#article3"> Its comparison with other sins</a> <li><a href="../summa/3073.htm#article4"> Is it a sin to listen to backbiting?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether backbiting is suitably defined as the blackening of another's character by secret words?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that backbiting is not as defined by some [Albert the Great, Sum. Theol. II, cxvii.], "the blackening of another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name by words uttered in secret." For "secretly" and "openly" are circumstances that do not constitute the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that it be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by many or by few. Now that which does not constitute the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, does not belong to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and should not be included in its definition. Therefore it does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of backbiting that it should be done by secret words.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the notion of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name implies something <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the public. If, therefore, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name is blackened by backbiting, this cannot be done by secret words, but by words uttered openly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to detract is to subtract, or to diminish something already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>. But sometimes a man's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name is blackened, even without subtracting from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for instance, when one reveals the crimes which a man has in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> committed. Therefore not every blackening of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name is backbiting.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/ecc010.htm#verse11">Ecclesiastes 10:11</a>): "If a serpent bite in silence, he is nothing better that backbiteth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> injures another by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> in two ways--openly, as by robbery or by doing him any kind of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>--and secretly, as by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, or by a crafty blow, so again one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> injures another by words in two ways--in one way, openly, and this is done by reviling him, as stated above (Question 72, Article 1)--and in another way secretly, and this is done by backbiting. Now from the fact that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> openly utters words against another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he would appear to think little of him, so that for this reason he dishonors him, so that reviling is detrimental to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> reviled. On the other hand, he that speaks against another secretly, seems to respect rather than slight him, so that he injures directly, not his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> but his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, in so far as by uttering such words secretly, he, for his own part, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> his hearers to have a bad opinion of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> against whom he speaks. For the backbiter apparently intends and aims at being <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. It is therefore evident that backbiting differs from reviling in two points: first, in the way in which the words are uttered, the reviler speaking openly against someone, and the backbiter secretly; secondly, as to the end in view, i.e. as regards the injury inflicted, the reviler injuring a man's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, the backbiter injuring his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In involuntary commutations, to which are reduced all injuries inflicted on our neighbor, whether by word or by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, the kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is differentiated by the circumstances "secretly" and "openly," because involuntariness itself is diversified by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, as stated above (65, 4; I-II, 6, 5,8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The words of a backbiter are said to be secret, not altogether, but in relation to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of whom they are said, because they are uttered in his absence and without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. On the other hand, the reviler speaks against a man to his face. Wherefore if a man speaks ill of another in the presence of several, it is a case of backbiting if he be absent, but of reviling if he alone be present: although if a man speak ill of an absent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> alone, he destroys his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name not altogether but partly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to backbite [detrehere] another, not because he detracts from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but because he lessens his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>. This is done sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. Directly, in four ways: first, by saying that which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> about him; secondly, by stating his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be greater than it is; thirdly, by revealing something unknown about him; fourthly, by ascribing his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> to a bad intention. Indirectly, this is done either by gainsaying his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or by maliciously concealing it, or by diminishing it.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether backbiting is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that backbiting is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For no act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now, to reveal an unknown <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which pertains to backbiting, as stated above (1, ad 3), is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby a man denounces his brother's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in order that he may amend: or else it is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereby a man accuses his brother. Therefore backbiting is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse21">Proverbs 24:21</a>, "Have nothing to do with detractors," says: "The whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is in peril from this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>." But no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to be found in the whole of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, since many refrain from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: whereas they are venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are found in all. Therefore backbiting is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> On the Fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> [Serm. civ in the appendix to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> work] reckons it a slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> "to speak ill without hesitation or forethought." But this pertains to backbiting. Therefore backbiting is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse30">Romans 1:30</a>): "Backbiters, hateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," which epithet, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, is inserted, "lest it be deemed a slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> because it consists in words."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 72, Article 2), <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of word should be judged chiefly from the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the speaker. Now backbiting by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> aims at blackening a man's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>. Wherefore, properly speaking, to backbite is to speak ill of an absent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in order to blacken his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>. Now it is a very grave <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to blacken a man's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, because of all temporal things a man's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name seems the most precious, since for lack of it he is hindered from doing many things well. For this reason it is written (<a href="../bible/sir041.htm#verse15">Sirach 41:15</a>): "Take care of a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, for this shall continue with thee, more than a thousand treasures precious and great." Therefore backbiting, properly speaking, is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nevertheless it happens sometimes that a man utters words, whereby someone's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name is tarnished, and yet he does not intend this, but something else. This is not backbiting strictly and formally speaking, but only materially and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> as it were. And if such defamatory words be uttered for the sake of some <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and with attention to the due circumstances, it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and cannot be called backbiting. But if they be uttered out of lightness of heart or for some unnecessary motive, it is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless perchance the spoken word be of such a grave <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a notable injury to a man's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, especially in matters pertaining to his moral character, because from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the words this would be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And one is bound to restore a man his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, no less than any other thing one has taken from him, in the manner stated above (Question 62, Article 2) when we were treating of restitution.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above, it is not backbiting to reveal a man's hidden <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in order that he may mend, whether one denounce it, or accuse him for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of public <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> does not assert that backbiting is to be found throughout the whole of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, but "almost," both because "the number of fools is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>," [<a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse15">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a> and few are they that walk in the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, [Cf. <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse14">Matthew 7:14</a>] and because there are few or none at all who do not at times speak from lightness of heart, so as to injure someone's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name at least slightly, for it is written (<a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse2">James 3:2</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> offend not in word, the same is a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is referring to the case when a man utters a slight <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> about someone, not intending to injure him, but through lightness of heart or a slip of the tongue.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether backbiting is the gravest of all sins committed against one's neighbor?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that backbiting is the gravest of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed against one's neighbor. Because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa108.htm#verse4">Psalm 108:4</a>, "Instead of making me a return of love they detracted me," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Those who detract Christ in His members and slay the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of future believers are more guilty than those who killed the flesh that was soon to rise again." From this it seems to follow that backbiting is by so much a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, as it is a graver <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than to kill the body. Now <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is the gravest of the other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are committed against one's neighbor. Therefore backbiting is absolutely the gravest of all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, backbiting is apparently a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than reviling, because a man can withstand reviling, but not a secret backbiting. Now backbiting is seemingly a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, because <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> unites two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in one flesh, whereas reviling severs utterly those who were united. Therefore backbiting is more grievous than <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: and yet of all other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> a man commits against his neighbor, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is most grave.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, reviling arises from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, while backbiting arises from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45). But <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Therefore backbiting is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than reviling; and so the same conclusion follows as before.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is measured by the gravity of the defect that it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Now backbiting <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a most grievous defect, viz. blindness of mind. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Regist. xi, Ep. 2): "What else do backbiters but blow on the dust and stir up the dirt into their eyes, so that the more they breathe of detraction, the less they see of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?" Therefore backbiting is the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against one's neighbor.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is more grievous to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> than by word. But backbiting is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of word, while <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Therefore backbiting is not graver than the other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed against one's neighbor.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed against one's neighbor must be weighed by the injury they inflict on him, since it is thence that they derive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the greater the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> taken away, the greater the injury. And while <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is threefold, namely the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his body, and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of external things; the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the greatest of all, cannot be taken from him by another save as an occasional <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for instance by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> persuasion, which does not induce <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. On the other hand the two latter goods, viz. of the body and of external things, can be taken away by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Since, however, the goods of the body excel the goods of external things, those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which injure a man's body are more grievous than those which injure his external things. Consequently, among other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed against one's neighbor, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is the most grievous, since it deprives <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the life which he already possesses: after this comes <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, which is contrary to the right order of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> enters upon life. On the last place come external goods, among which a man's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name takes precedence of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> because it is more akin to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/pro022.htm#verse1">Proverbs 22:1</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name is better than great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>." Therefore backbiting according to its genus is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, but is less grievous than <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Nevertheless the order may differ by reason of aggravating or extenuating circumstances.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to be considered in relation to the sinner, who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously, if he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> deliberately than if he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through weakness or carelessness. On this respect <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of word have a certain levity, in so far as they are apt to occur through a slip of the tongue, and without much forethought.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those who detract Christ by hindering the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of His members, disparage His Godhead, which is the foundation of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Wherefore this is not simple backbiting but <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Reviling is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than backbiting, in as much as it implies greater contempt of one's neighbor: even as robbery is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, as stated above (Question 66, Article 09). Yet reviling is not a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. For the gravity of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is measured, not from its being a union of bodies, but from being a disorder in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation. Moreover the reviler is not the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of unfriendliness in another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but is only the occasional <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of division among those who were united, in so far, to wit, as by declaring the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of another, he for his own part severs that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the friendship of other men, though they are not forced by his words to do so. Accordingly a backbiter is a murderer "occasionally," since by his words he gives another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> an occasion for hating or despising his neighbor. For this reason it is stated in the Epistle of Clement [Ad Jacob. Ep. i], that "backbiters are murderers," i.e. occasionally; because "he that hateth his brother is a murderer" (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse15">1 John 3:15</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Anger seeks openly to be avenged, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Rhet. ii, 2): wherefore backbiting which takes place in secret, is not the daughter of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as reviling is, but rather of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, which strives by any means to lessen one's neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Nor does it follow from this that backbiting is more grievous than reviling: since a lesser <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> can give rise to a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> gives birth to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. For the origin of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> depends on its inclination to an end, i.e. on the thing to which the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> turns, whereas the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> depends on what it turns away from.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since "a man rejoiceth in the sentence of his mouth" (<a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse23">Proverbs 15:23</a>), it follows that a backbiter more and more loves and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> what he says, and consequently more and more <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his neighbor, and thus his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> becomes less and less. This effect however may also result from other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> pertaining to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> of one's neighbor.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is a grave sin for the listener to suffer the backbiter?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the listener who suffers a backbiter does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> grievously. For a man is not under greater <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to others than to himself. But it is praiseworthy for a man to suffer his own backbiters: for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. ix, super Ezech): "Just as we ought not to incite the tongue of backbiters, lest they perish, so ought we to suffer them with equanimity when they have been incited by their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, in order that our <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> may be the greater." Therefore a man does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he does not withstand those who backbite others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/sir004.htm#verse30">Sirach 4:30</a>): "In no wise speak against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now sometimes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> tells the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> while backbiting, as stated above (1, ad 3). Therefore it seems that one is not always bound to withstand a backbiter.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should hinder what is profitable to others. Now backbiting is often profitable to those who are backbitten: for Pope Pius [St. Pius I] says [Append. Grat. ad can. Oves, caus. vi, qu. 1: "Not unfrequently backbiting is directed against <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, with the result that those who have been unduly exalted through the flattery of their kindred, or the favor of others, are <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> by backbiting." Therefore one ought not to withstand backbiters.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. ad Nepot. lii): "Take care not to have an itching tongue, nor tingling ears, that is, neither detract others nor listen to backbiters."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse32">Romans 1:32</a>), they "are worthy of death . . . not only they that" commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, "but they also that consent to them that do them." Now this happens in two ways. First, directly, when, to wit, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> induces another to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is pleasing to him: secondly, indirectly, that is, if he does not withstand him when he might do so, and this happens sometimes, not because the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is pleasing to him, but on account of some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fear.

<p>Accordingly we must say that if a man list ens to backbiting without resisting it, he seems to consent to the backbiter, so that he becomes a participator in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And if he induces him to backbite, or at least if the detraction be pleasing to him on account of his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> detracted, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> no less than the detractor, and sometimes more. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> says (De Consid. ii, 13): "It is difficult to say which is the more to be condemned the backbiter or he that listens to backbiting." If however the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not pleasing to him, and he fails to withstand the backbiter, through fear negligence, or even shame, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> indeed, but much less than the backbiter, and, as a rule venially. Sometimes too this may be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either because it is his official <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to cor. rect the backbiter, or by reason of some consequent danger; or on account of the radical reason for which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fear may sometimes be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 19, Article 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hears himself backbitten, because when a man is spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of in his hearing, it is not backbiting, properly speaking, but reviling, as stated above (1, ad 2). Yet it is possible for the detractions uttered against a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to come to his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through others telling him, and then it is left to his discretion whether he will suffer their detriment to his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, unless this endanger the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others, as stated above (Question 72, Article 3). Wherefore his patience may deserve commendation for as much as he suffers patiently being detracted himself.

<p>But it is not left to his discretion to permit an injury to be done to another's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, hence he is accounted guilty if he fails to resist when he can, for the same reason whereby a man is bound to raise another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ass lying "underneath his burden," as commanded in <a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 21:4</a> [<a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse5">Exodus 23:5</a>].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> One ought not always to withstand a backbiter by endeavoring to convince him of falsehood, especially if one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he is speaking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: rather ought one to reprove him with words, for that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in backbiting his brother, or at least by our pained demeanor show him that we are displeased with his backbiting, because according to <a href="../bible/pro025.htm#verse23">Proverbs 25:23</a>, "the north wind driveth away rain, as doth a sad countenance a backbiting tongue."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The profit one derives from being backbitten is due, not to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the backbiter, but to the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who produces <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> out of every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence we should none the less withstand backbiters, just as those who rob or oppress others, even though the oppressed and the robbed may gain <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by patience.
