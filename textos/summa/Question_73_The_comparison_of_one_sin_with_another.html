<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether all sins are connected with one another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are connected. For it is written (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse10">James 2:10</a>): "Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all." Now to be guilty of transgressing all the precepts of Law, is the same as to commit all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Parad. viii), "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a transgression of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, and disobedience of the heavenly commandments." Therefore whoever commits one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is guilty of all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> banishes its opposite <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now whoever lacks one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> lacks them all, as was shown above (Question 65, Article 1). Therefore whoever commits one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is deprived of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore whoever commits one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is guilty of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are connected, because they have a principle in common, as stated above (65, A1,2). Now as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have a common principle, so have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because, as the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which builds the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the beginning and root of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, so self-love, which builds the city of Babylon, is the root of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Civ. Dei xiv, 28). Therefore all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are also connected so that whoever has one, has them all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Some <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are contrary to one another, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ii, 8). But contraries cannot be together in the same subject. Therefore it is impossible for all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> to be connected with one another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who acts according to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in pursuance of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is different from the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the sinner in straying from the path of reason. For the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acting according to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is to follow the rule of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is directed to the same end, so that all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are connected together in the right reason of things to be done, viz. <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (Question 65, Article 1). But the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the sinner is not directed to the point of straying from the path of reason; rather is it directed to tend to some appetible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> whence it derives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now these goods, to which the sinner's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is directed when departing from reason, are of various kinds, having no mutual connection; in fact they are sometimes contrary to one another. Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from that to which they turn, it is evident that, in respect of that which completes a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin's</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not connected with one another. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not consist in passing from the many to the one, as is the case with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which are connected, but rather in forsaking the one for the many.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> James is speaking of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not as regards the thing to which it turns and which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the distinction of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as stated above (72, 1), but as regards that from which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> turns away, in as much as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, departs from a commandment of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now all the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are from one and the same, as he also says in the same passage, so that the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is despised in every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and in this sense he says that whoever "offends in one point, is become guilty of all," for as much as, by committing one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he incurs the debt of punishment through his contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the origin of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (Question 71, Article 4), the opposite <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not banished by every act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; because venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not destroy <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; while mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> destroys infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by turning <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet one act, even of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, does not destroy the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; though if such acts be repeated so as to engender a contrary <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is destroyed, the destruction of which entails the loss of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, since when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acts against any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whatever, he acts against <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, without which no moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is possible, as stated above (58, 4; 65, 1). Consequently all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are destroyed as to the perfect and formal being of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which they have in so far as they partake of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, yet there remain the inclinations to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts, which inclinations, however, are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Nevertheless it does not follow that for this reason <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> contracts all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>--first, because several <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so that a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be destroyed by one of them, without the others being present; secondly, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as regards the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> inclination to act, as stated above (Question 71, Article 1). Wherefore, as long as any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> inclinations remain, it cannot be said that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the opposite <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is unitive, in as much as it draws <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affections from the many to the one; so that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which flow from the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are connected together. But self-love disunites <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affections among different things, in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves himself, by desiring for himself temporal goods, which are various and of many kinds: hence <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which arise from self-love, are not connected together.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether all sins are equal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are equal. Because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to do what is unlawful. Now to do what is unlawful is reproved in one and the same way in all things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is reproved in one and the same way. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not graver than another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a transgression of the rule of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which is to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> what a linear rule is in corporeal things. Therefore to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the same as to pass over a line. But passing over a line occurs equally and in the same way, even if one go a long way from it or stay near it, since privations do not admit of more or less. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are equal.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are equal, as Cicero states (Paradox. iii). Therefore all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are equal.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse11">John 19:11</a>): "He that hath delivered me to thee, hath the greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," and yet it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> was guilty of some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is greater than another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The opinion of the Stoics, which Cicero adopts in the book on Paradoxes (Paradox. iii), was that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are equal: from which opinion arose the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who not only hold all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to be equal, but also maintain that all the pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> are equal. So far as can be gathered from the words of Cicero the Stoics arrived at their conclusion through looking at <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on the side of the privation only, in so far, to wit, as it is a departure from reason; wherefore considering simply that no privation admits of more or less, they held that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are equal. Yet, if we consider the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> carefully, we shall see that there are two kinds of privation. For there is a simple and pure privation, which consists, so to speak, in "being" corrupted; thus death is privation of life, and darkness is privation of light. Such like privations do not admit of more or less, because nothing remains of the opposite <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; hence a man is not less dead on the first day after his death, or on the third or fourth days, than after a year, when his corpse is already dissolved; and, in like manner, a house is no darker if the light be covered with several shades, than if it were covered by a single shade shutting out all the light. There is, however, another privation which is not simple, but retains something of the opposite <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; it consists in "becoming" corrupted rather than in "being" corrupted, like sickness which is a privation of the due commensuration of the humors, yet so that something remains of that commensuration, else the animal would cease to live: and the same applies to deformity and the like. Such privations admit of more or less on the part of what remains or the contrary <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For it matters much in sickness or deformity, whether one departs more or less from the due commensuration of humors or members. The same applies to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: because in them the privation of the due commensuration of reason is such as not to destroy the order of reason altogether; else <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, if total, destroys itself, as stated in Ethic. iv, 5. For the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, or the affection of the agent could not remain, unless something remained of the order of reason. Therefore it matters much to the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whether one departs more or less from the rectitude of reason: and accordingly we must say that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not all equal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is lawful on account of some inordinateness therein: wherefore those which contain a greater inordinateness are more unlawful, and consequently graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument looks upon <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as though it were a pure privation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Virtues are proportionately equal in one and the same subject: yet one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> surpasses another in excellence according to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and again, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> than another, in the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (66, A1,2). Moreover, even if <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were equal, it would not follow that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are equal, since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are connected, and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the gravity of sins varies according to their objects?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> does not vary according to their objects. Because the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> pertains to its mode or <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>: whereas the object is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> does not vary according to their various objects.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the intensity of its <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not derive its <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> from its proper object to which it turns, and which is some appetible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but rather from that which it turns away from. Therefore the gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> does not vary according to their various objects.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that have different objects are of different kinds. But things of different kinds cannot be compared with one another, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. vii, text. 30, seqq. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not graver than another by reason of the difference of objects.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sins</a> take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their objects, as was shown above (Question 72, Article 1). But some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are graver than others in respect of their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is graver than <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>. Therefore the gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> varies according to their objects.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is clear from what has been said (71, 5), the gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> varies in the same way as one sickness is graver than another: for just as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of health consists in a certain commensuration of the humors, in keeping with an animal's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in a certain commensuration of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> in accord with the rule of reason. Now it is evident that the higher the principle the disorder of which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the disorder in the humors, the graver is the sickness: thus a sickness which comes on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body from the heart, which is the principle of life, or from some neighboring part, is more dangerous. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> must needs be so much the graver, as the disorder occurs in a principle which is higher in the order of reason. Now in matters of action the reason directs all things in view of the end: wherefore the higher the end which attaches to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, the graver the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the object of an act is its end, as stated above (72, 3, ad 2); and consequently the difference of gravity in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> depends on their objects. Thus it is clear that external things are directed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as their end, while <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is further directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as his end. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is about the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, is graver than a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is about external things, e.g. <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>; and graver still is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed directly against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, e.g. unbelief, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and the like: and in each of these grades of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will be graver than another according as it is about a higher or lower principle. And forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their objects, the difference of gravity which is derived from the objects is first and foremost, as resulting from the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the object is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> about which an act is concerned, yet it has the character of an end, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the agent is fixed on it, as stated above (72, 3, ad 2). Now the form of a moral act depends on the end, as was shown above (72, 6; 18, 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From the very fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turns unduly to some mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it follows that he turns away from the immutable Good, which aversion completes the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence the various degrees of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> must needs follow the diversity of those things to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turns.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All the objects of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are related to one another, wherefore all <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are somewhat of one kind, in so far as they are directed to the last end. Therefore nothing prevents all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from being compared with one another.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the gravity of sins depends on the excellence of the virtues to which they are opposed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> does not vary according to the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to which they are opposed, so that, to wit, the graver the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to the greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For, according to <a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse5">Proverbs 15:5</a>, "In abundant <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> there is the greatest strength." Now, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew 5:20, seqq.</a>) abundant <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> restrains <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which is a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, which less abundant <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> restrains. Therefore the least grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to the greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is stated in Ethic. ii, 3 that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about the difficult and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>": whence it seems to follow that the greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about what is more difficult. But it is a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to fail in what is more difficult, than in what is less difficult. Therefore the less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to the greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or hope (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than unbelief or <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> which are opposed to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope. Therefore the less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to the greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. 8:10) that the "worst is opposed to the best." Now in morals the best is the greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and the worst is the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to the greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in two ways: first, principally and directly; that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to with, which is about the same object: because contraries are about the same thing. In this way, the more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> must needs be opposed to the greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: because, just as the degrees of gravity in a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> depend on the object, so also does the greatness of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since both <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the object, as shown above (60, 5; 72, 1). Wherefore the greatest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> must needs be directly opposed to the greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as being furthest removed from it in the same genus. Secondly, the opposition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be considered in respect of a certain extension of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in checking <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the greater a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is, the further it removes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the contrary <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that it withdraws <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> not only from that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also from whatever leads to it. And thus it is evident that the greater a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is, the more it withdraws <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also from less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: even as the more perfect health is, the more does it ward off even minor ailments. And in this way the less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to the greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, on the part of the latter's effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers the opposition which consists in restraining from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for thus abundant <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> checks even minor <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that is about a more difficult <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is opposed directly to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is about a more difficult <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For in each case there is a certain superiority, in that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is shown to be more intent on <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, through not being overcome by the difficulty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is not any kind of love, but the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: hence not any kind of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is opposed to it directly, but the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the most grievous of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether carnal sins are of less guilt than spiritual sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not of less guilt than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse30">Proverbs 6:30-32</a>): "The fault is not so great when a man has stolen . . . but he that is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart shall destroy his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; while <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> pertains to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which is a carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are of greater guilt than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his commentary on Leviticus [The quotation is from De Civ. Dei ii, 4 and iv, 31.] that "the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> rejoices chiefly in <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>." But he rejoices more in the greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is a carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it seems that the carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are of most guilt.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Ethic. vii, 6) that "it is more shameful to be incontinent in <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> than in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>." But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 17); while <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> pertains to carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more grievous than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxiii, 11) that carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are of less guilt, but of more shame than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Spiritual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are of greater guilt than carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: yet this does not mean that each <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is of greater guilt than each carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but that, considering the sole difference between <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and carnal, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are more grievous than carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, other things being equal. Three reasons may be assigned for this. The first is on the part of the subject: because <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> belong to the spirit, to which it is proper to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to turn away from Him; whereas carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are consummated in the carnal pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, to which it chiefly belongs to turn to goods of the body; so that carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as such, denotes more a "turning to" something, and for that reason, implies a closer cleaving; whereas <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> denotes more a "turning from" something, whence the notion of guilt arises; and for this reason it involves greater guilt. A second reason may be taken on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> against whom <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed: because carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as such, is against the sinner's own body, which he ought to love less, in the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his neighbor, against whom he commits <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and consequently <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as such, are of greater guilt. A third reason may be taken from the motive, since the stronger the impulse to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the less grievous the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as we shall state further on (6). Now carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have a stronger impulse, viz. our innate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as such, are of greater guilt.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Adultery belongs not only to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, but also to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and in this respect may be brought under the head of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes on <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse5">Ephesians 5:5</a>. "No fornicator, or <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, or covetous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>," etc.; so that <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is so much more grievous than <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, as a man loves his wife more than his chattels.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is said to rejoice chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, because it is of the greatest adhesion, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can with difficulty be withdrawn from it. "For the desire of pleasure is insatiable," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. iii, 12).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> himself says (Ethic. vii, 6), the reason why it is more shameful to be incontinent in <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> than in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, is that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> partakes less of reason; and in the same sense he says (Ethic. iii, 10) that "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of intemperance are most worthy of reproach, because they are about those pleasures which are common to us and irrational minds": hence, by these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is, so to speak, brutalized; for which same reason <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 17) that they are more shameful.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the gravity of a sin depends on its cause?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not depend on its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Because the greater a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin's</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the more forcibly it moves to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and so the more difficult is it to resist. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is lessened by the fact that it is difficult to resist; for it denotes weakness in the sinner, if he cannot easily resist <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is due to weakness is deemed less grievous. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not derive its gravity from its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse7">Romans 7:7</a>, "For I had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>," says: "The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since by forbidding <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, it forbids all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>." Now the greater the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is overcome, the less grievous his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is diminished by the greatness of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as rectitude of the reason is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act, so defect in the reason seems to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the greater the defect in the reason, the less grievous the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: so much so that he who lacks the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is altogether excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> less grievously. Therefore the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not increased by the greatness of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be increased, the effect is increased. Therefore the greater the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the more grievous the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the genus of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as in every other genus, two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> may be observed. The first is the direct and proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for it is compared to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, as a tree to its fruit, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes on <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse18">Matthew 7:18</a>, "A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tree cannot bring forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit": and the greater this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is, the more grievous will the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be, since the greater the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the more grievously does <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>The other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are extrinsic and remote, as it were, being those whereby the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is inclined to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Among these <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> we must make a distinction; for some of them induce the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in accord with the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: such is the end, which is the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; and by a such like <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is made more grievous, because a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously if his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is induced to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of a more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end. Other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> incline the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and order of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination is to be moved freely of itself in accord with the judgment of reason. Wherefore those <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> which weaken the judgment of reason (e.g. <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>), or which weaken the free movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, (e.g. weakness, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, fear, or the like), diminish the gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even as they diminish its voluntariness; and so much so, that if the act be altogether involuntary, it is no longer <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers the extrinsic moving <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which diminishes voluntariness. The increase of such a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> diminishes the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> be understood to include the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, then, where there is greater <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, there is a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if by <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> we understand a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, which is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power, then a greater <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, forestalling the judgment of reason and the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, diminishes the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, being stimulated by a greater <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, falls through a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, wherefore he is less to be blamed. On the other hand, if <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> be taken in this sense follows the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, then the greater <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, the graver the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because sometimes the movement of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is redoubled by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tending unrestrainedly to its object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which renders the act involuntary, and such a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> diminishes the gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether a circumstance aggravates a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a circumstance does not aggravate a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> takes its gravity from its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now a circumstance does not specify a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for it is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> thereof. Therefore the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not taken from a circumstance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a circumstance is either <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or not: if it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, of itself, a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and if it is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it cannot make a thing worse. Therefore a circumstance nowise aggravates a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is derived from its turning away (from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>). But circumstances affect <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on the part of the object to which it turns. Therefore they do not add to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin's</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> of a circumstance diminishes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of a circumstance, deserves to be forgiven (Ethic. iii, 1). Now this would not be the case unless a circumstance aggravated a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore a circumstance makes a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more grievous.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in speaking of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> (Ethic. ii, 1,2), "it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for a thing to be increased by that which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> it." Now it is evident that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a defect in some circumstance: because the fact that a man departs from the order of reason is due to his not observing the due circumstances in his action. Wherefore it is evident that it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be aggravated by reason of its circumstances. This happens in three ways. First, in so far as a circumstance draws a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from one kind to another: thus fornication is the intercourse of a man with one who is not his wife: but if to this be added the circumstance that the latter is the wife of another, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is drawn to another kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, in so far as he usurps another's property; and in this respect <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than fornication. Secondly, a circumstance aggravates a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not by drawing it into another genus, but only by multiplying the ratio of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: thus if a wasteful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gives both when he ought not, and to whom he ought not to give, he commits the same kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in more ways than if he were to merely to give to whom he ought not, and for that very reason his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more grievous; even as that sickness is the graver which affects more parts of the body. Hence Cicero says (Paradox. iii) that "in taking his father's life a man commits many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for he outrages one who begot him, who fed him, who educated him, to whom he owes his lands, his house, his position in the republic." Thirdly, a circumstance aggravates a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by adding to the deformity which the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> derives from another circumstance: thus, taking another's property constitutes the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>; but if to this be added the circumstance that much is taken of another's property, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will be more grievous; although in itself, to take more or less has not the character of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some circumstances do specify a moral act, as stated above (Question 18, Article 10). Nevertheless a circumstance which does not give the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, may aggravate a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; because, even as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a thing is weighed, not only in reference to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but also in reference to an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of an act is measured, not only according to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that act, but also according to a circumstance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A circumstance may aggravate a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> either way. For if it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it does not follow that it constitutes the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin's</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; because it may multiply the ratio of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> within the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above. And if it be not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it may aggravate a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in relation to the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of another circumstance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> should direct the action not only as regards the object, but also as regards every circumstance. Therefore one may turn aside from the rule of reason through corruption of any single circumstance; for instance, by doing something when one ought not or where one ought not; and to depart thus from the rule of reason suffices to make the act <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. This turning aside from the rule of reason results from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to be united by right reason.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether sin is aggravated by reason of its causing more harm?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not aggravated by reason of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> more harm. Because the harm done is an issue consequent to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act. But the issue of an act does not add to its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, as stated above (Question 20, Article 5). Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not aggravated on account of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> more harm.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, harm is inflicted by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against our neighbor. Because no one wishes to harm himself: and no one can harm <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job035.htm#verse6">Job 35:6-8</a>: "If thy iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against Him? . . . Thy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> may hurt a man that is like thee." If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were aggravated through <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> more harm, it would follow that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against our neighbor are more grievous than <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or oneself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, greater harm is inflicted on a man by depriving him of the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, than by taking away his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> life; because the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is better than the life of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so far that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to despise his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> life lest he lose the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now, speaking absolutely, a man who leads a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to commit fornication deprives her of the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by leading her into mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were more grievous on account of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> a greater harm, it would follow that fornication, absolutely speaking, is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, which is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not more grievous on account of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> a greater harm.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. iii, 14): "Since <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is the more grievous according as it diminishes the integrity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Now the diminution of the integrity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a harm. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is graver according as it does more harm.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Harm may bear a threefold relation to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Because sometimes the harm resulting from a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is foreseen and intended, as when a man does something with a mind to harm another, e.g. a murderer or a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>. In this case the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of harm aggravates the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> directly, because then the harm is the direct object of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Sometimes the harm is foreseen, but not intended; for instance, when a man takes a short cut through a field, the result being that he knowingly injures the growing crops, although his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is not to do this harm, but to commit fornication. In this case again the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the harm done aggravates the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; indirectly, however, in so far, to wit, as it is owing to his will being strongly inclined to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that a man does not forbear from doing, to himself or to another, a harm which he would not wish simply. Sometimes, however, the harm is neither foreseen nor intended: and then if this harm is connected with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, it does not aggravate the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> directly; but, on account of his neglecting to consider the harm that might ensue, a man is deemed punishable for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> results of his action if it be unlawful. If, on the other hand, the harm follow directly from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, although it be neither foreseen nor intended, it aggravates the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> directly, because whatever is directly consequent to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, belongs, in a manner, to the very <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for instance, if a man is a <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> fornicator, the result is that many are <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>; and although such was not his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, nor was it perhaps foreseen by him, yet it aggravates his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> directly.

<p>But this does not seem to apply to penal harm, which the sinner himself incurs. Such like harm, if <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> connected with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, and if neither foreseen nor intended, does not aggravate a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor does it correspond with the gravity of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for instance, if a man in running to slay, slips and hurts his foot. If, on the other hand, this harm is directly consequent to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, although perhaps it be neither foreseen nor intended, then greater harm does not make greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but, on the contrary, a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> calls for the infliction of a greater harm. Thus, an unbeliever who has heard nothing about the pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, would suffer greater pain in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> than for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>: but his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not aggravated on account of his neither intending nor foreseeing this, as it would be in the case of a believer, who, seemingly, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously in the very fact that he despises a greater punishment, that he may satisfy his desire to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but the gravity of this harm is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the sole gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As we have already stated (20, 5), in treating of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of external actions, the result of an action if foreseen and intended adds to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of an act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the harm done aggravates a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it does not follow that this alone renders a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more grievous: in fact, it is inordinateness which of itself aggravates a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore the harm itself that ensues aggravates a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far only as it renders the act more inordinate. Hence it does not follow, supposing harm to be inflicted chiefly by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against our neighbor, that such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are the most grievous, since a much greater inordinateness is to be found against which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> commits against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in some which he commits against himself. Moreover we might say that although no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can do <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> any harm in His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, yet he can endeavor to do so in things concerning Him, e.g. by destroying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by outraging <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, which are most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Again, a man sometimes knowingly and freely inflicts harm on himself, as in the case of suicide, though this be referred finally to some apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for example, delivery from some anxiety.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>, for two reasons: first, because the murderer intends directly to do harm to his neighbors; whereas the fornicator who solicits the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> intends not to harm but pleasure; secondly, because <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is the direct and sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of bodily death; whereas no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can of himself be the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> death, because no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> dies spiritually except by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> of his own will.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether a sin is aggravated by reason of the condition of the person against whom it is committed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not aggravated by reason of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> against whom it is committed. For if this were the case a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would be aggravated chiefly by being committed against a just and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But this does not aggravate a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who bears a wrong with equanimity is less harmed by the wrong done him, than others, who, through being <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>, are also hurt inwardly. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> against whom a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed does not aggravate the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> aggravated the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this would be still more the case if the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> be near of kin, because, as Cicero says (Paradox. iii): "The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who kills his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> once: he that takes his father's life <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> many times." But the kinship of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against does not apparently aggravate a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is most akin to himself; and yet it is less grievous to harm oneself than another, e.g. to kill one's own, than another's horse, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. v, 11). Therefore kinship of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against does not aggravate the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> aggravates a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> chiefly on account of his position or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to <a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse7">Wisdom 6:7</a>: "The mighty shall be mightily tormented," and <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse47">Luke 12:47</a>: "The servant who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his lord . . . and did it not . . . shall be beaten with many stripes." Therefore, in like manner, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is made more grievous by reason of his position and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But, apparently, it is not a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to inflict an injury on a rich and powerful <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> than on a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since "there is no respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse25">Colossians 3:25</a>), according to Whose judgment the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is measured. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against does not aggravate the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> censures especially those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are committed against the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus it is written (<a href="../bible/1ki019.htm#verse14">1 Kings 19:14</a>): "They have destroyed Thy altars, they have slain Thy <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> with the sword." Moreover much blame is attached to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed by a man against those who are akin to him, according to <a href="../bible/mic007.htm#verse6">Micah 7:6</a>: "the son dishonoreth the father, and the daughter riseth up against her mother." Furthermore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed against <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of rank are expressly condemned: thus it is written (<a href="../bible/job034.htm#verse18">Job 34:18</a>): "Who saith to the king: 'Thou art an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>'; who calleth rulers ungodly." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against aggravates the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against is, in a manner, the object of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it has been stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>) that the primary gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is derived from its object; so that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is deemed to be so much the more grave, as its object is a more principal end. But the principal ends of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself, and his neighbor: for whatever we do, it is on account of one of these that we do it; although one of them is subordinate to the other. Therefore the greater or lesser gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in respect of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against, may be considered on the part of these three.

<p>First, on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the more closely united, as he is more <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> or more sacred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: so that an injury inflicted on such a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> redounds on to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to <a href="../bible/zec002.htm#verse8">Zechariah 2:8</a>: "He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of My eye." Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the more grievous, according as it is committed against a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> more closely united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by reason of personal sanctity, or official station. On the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself, it is evident that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> all the more grievously, according as the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> against whom he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is more united to him, either through <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> affinity or kindness received or any other bond; because he seems to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against himself rather than the other, and, for this very reason, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> all the more grievously, according to <a href="../bible/sir014.htm#verse5">Sirach 14:5</a>: "He that is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to himself, to whom will he be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>?" On the part of his neighbor, a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> the more grievously, according as his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> affects more <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: so that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against a public personage, e.g. a sovereign prince who stands in the place of the whole people, is more grievous than a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against a private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; hence it is expressly prohibited (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse28">Exodus 22:28</a>): "The prince of thy people thou shalt not curse." In like manner it would seem that an injury done to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of prominence, is all the more grave, on account of the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> and the disturbance it would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> among many people.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He who inflicts an injury on a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so far as he is concerned, disturbs him internally and externally; but that the latter is not disturbed internally is due to his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, which does not extenuate the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the injurer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The injury which a man inflicts on himself in those things which are subject to the dominion of his will, for instance his possessions, is less <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> than if it were inflicted on another, because he does it of his own will; but in those things that are not subject to the dominion of his will, such as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, it is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to inflict an injury on oneself: for it is more grievous for a man to kill himself than another. Since, however, things belonging to our neighbor are not subject to the dominion of our will, the argument fails to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>, in respect of injuries done to such like things, that it is less grievous to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in their regard, unless indeed our neighbor be willing, or give his approval.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is no respect for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> punishes more severely those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of higher rank; for this is done because such an injury redounds to the harm of many.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether the excellence of the person sinning aggravates the sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> does not aggravate the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes great chiefly by cleaving to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/sir025.htm#verse13">Sirach 25:13</a>: "How great is he that findeth wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>! but there is none above him that feareth the Lord." Now the more a man cleaves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the less is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> imputed to him: for it is written (<a href="../bible/2ch030.htm#verse18">2 Chronicles 30:18-19</a>): "The Lord Who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will show mercy to all them, who with their whole heart seek the Lord the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers; and will not impute it to them that they are not sanctified." Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not aggravated by the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "there is no respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse11">Romans 2:11</a>). Therefore He does not punish one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> more than another, for one and the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not aggravated by the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one should reap disadvantage from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But he would, if his action were the more blameworthy on account of his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not aggravated by reason of the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Summo Bono ii, 18): "A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is deemed so much the more grievous as the sinner is held to be a more excellent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sin is twofold. There is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which takes us unawares on account of the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and such like <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are less imputable to one who is more <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, because he is less negligent in checking those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which nevertheless <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness does not allow us to escape altogether. But there are other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which proceed from deliberation: and these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are all the more imputed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according as he is more excellent. Four reasons may be assigned for this. First, because a more excellent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, e.g. one who excels in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, can more easily resist <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse47">Luke 12:47</a>) that the "servant who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his lord . . . and did it not . . . shall be beaten with many stripes." Secondly, on account of ingratitude, because every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in which a man excels, is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ungrateful when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and in this respect any excellence, even in temporal goods, aggravates a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse7">Wisdom 6:7</a>: "The mighty shall be mightily tormented." Thirdly, on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act being specially inconsistent with the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>: for instance, if a prince were to violate <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereas he is set up as the guardian of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> were to be a fornicator, whereas he has taken the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity. Fourthly, on account of the example or <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>; because, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. i, 2): "Sin becomes much more scandalous, when the sinner is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> for his position": and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the great are much more <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> and men are wont to bear them with more indignation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passage quoted alludes to those things which are done negligently when we are taken unawares through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not respect <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in punishing the great more severely, because their excellence conduces to the gravity of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who excels in anything reaps disadvantage, not from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which he has, but from his abuse thereof.
