<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the Eucharist is a sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For two <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> ought not to be ordained for the same end, because every sacrament is efficacious in producing its effect. Therefore, since both Confirmation and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> are ordained for perfection, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iv), it seems that the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, since Confirmation is one, as stated above (65, 1; 72, 1).

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in every sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, that which comes visibly under our senses <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the invisible effect of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, just as cleansing with water <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the baptismal character and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> cleansing, as stated above (63, 6; 66, 1,3,7). But the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of bread and wine, which are the objects of our senses in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, neither produce <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body, which is both reality and sacrament, nor His <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a>, which is the reality only in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Therefore, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, as having <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, are perfected by the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is by ablution, and Confirmation by signing with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>. If, then, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> be a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it would be perfected by the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and not by its <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. But this is manifestly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because the words spoken in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as will be shown later on (78, 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in the <a href="../cathen/04103a.htm">Collect</a> [Postcommunion "pro vivis et defunctis"]: "May this Thy Sacrament not make us deserving of punishment."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Church's <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are ordained for helping <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life. But the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life is analogous to the corporeal, since corporeal things bear a resemblance to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Now it is clear that just as generation is required for corporeal life, since thereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives life; and growth, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is brought to maturity: so likewise food is required for the preservation of life. Consequently, just as for the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life there had to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> generation; and Confirmation, which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> growth: so there needed to be the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Perfection is twofold. The first lies within <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself; and he attains it by growth: such perfection belongs to Confirmation. The other is the perfection which comes to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the addition of food, or clothing, or something of the kind; and such is the perfection befitting the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> refreshment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> any <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect by reason of the water, but by reason of the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which power is in the water. Hence on <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse4">John 5:4</a>, "An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord at certain times," etc., <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> observes: "The water does not act simply as such upon the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but when it receives the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, then it looses all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. bears the same relation to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the bread and wine, as the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> does to the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: hence the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the bread and wine produce no effect except from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A sacrament is so termed because it contains something sacred. Now a thing can be styled sacred from two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; either absolutely, or in relation to something else. The difference between the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> and other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> having sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is that whereas the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> contains something which is sacred absolutely, namely, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own body; the baptismal water contains something which is sacred in relation to something else, namely, the sanctifying power: and the same holds good of chrism and such like. Consequently, the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is completed in the very <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, whereas the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are completed in the application of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for the sanctifying of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. And from this follows another difference. For, in the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, what is both reality and sacrament is in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> itself. but what is reality only, namely, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed, is in the recipient; whereas in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> both are in the recipient, namely, the character, which is both reality and sacrament, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which is reality only. And the same holds good of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the Eucharist is one sacrament or several?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is not one sacrament but several, because it is said in the <a href="../cathen/04103a.htm">Collect</a> [Postcommunion "pro vivis et defunctis"]: "May the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which we have received purify us, O Lord": and this is said on account of our receiving the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is not one sacrament but several.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is impossible for genera to be multiplied without the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> being multiplied: thus it is impossible for one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be many animals. But, as stated above (Question 60, Article 1), sign is the genus of sacrament. Since, then, there are more signs than one, to wit, bread and wine, it seems to follow that here must be more <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> than one.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is perfected in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as stated above (1, ad 3). But in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> there is a double <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore, it is a twofold sacrament.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>): "For we, being many, are one bread, one body, all that partake of one bread": from which it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> unity. But a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> bears the likeness of the reality whereof it is the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is one sacrament.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in Metaph. v, a thing is said to be one, not only from being indivisible, or continuous, but also when it is complete; thus we speak of one house, and one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. A thing is one in perfection, when it is complete through the presence of all that is needed for its end; as a man is complete by having all the members required for the operation of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and a house by having all the parts needful for dwelling therein. And so this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is said to be one. Because it is ordained for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> refreshment, which is conformed to corporeal refreshment. Now there are two things required for corporeal refreshment, namely, food, which is dry sustenance, and drink, which is wet sustenance. Consequently, two things concur for the integrity of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, to wit, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> drink, according to John: "My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed." Therefore, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is materially many, but formally and perfectively one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The same Collect at first employs the plural: "May the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which we have received purify us"; and afterwards the singular number: "May this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of Thine not make us worthy of punishment": so as to show that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is in a measure several, yet simply one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The bread and wine are materially several signs, yet formally and perfectively one, inasmuch as one refreshment is prepared therefrom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> From the double <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> no more can be gathered than that the sacrament is several materially, as stated above.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the Eucharist is necessary for salvation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse54">John 6:54</a>): "Except you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and drink His blood, you shall not have life in you." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh is eaten and His blood drunk in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore, without this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot have the health of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food. But bodily food is requisite for bodily health. Therefore, also is this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> health.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, without which there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, so also is the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse26">1 Corinthians 11:26</a>): "For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, you shall show the death of the Lord, until He come." Consequently, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, so also is this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> writes (Ad Bonifac. contra Pelag. I): "Nor are you to suppose that children cannot possess life, who are deprived of the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things have to be considered in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, namely, the sacrament itself, and what is contained in it. Now it was stated above (1, Objection 2) that the reality of the sacrament is the unity of the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a>, without which there can be no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; for there is no entering into <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, just as in the time of the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">deluge</a> there was none outside the Ark, which denotes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse20">1 Peter 3:20-21</a>. And it has been said above (Question 68, Article 2), that before receiving a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, the reality of the sacrament can be had through the very desire of receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Accordingly, before actual reception of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, a man can obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through the desire of receiving it, just as he can before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> through the desire of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as stated above (Question 68, Article 2). Yet there is a difference in two respects. First of all, because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, and the door of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; whereas the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is, as it were, the consummation of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, and the end of all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as was observed above (Question 63, Article 6): for by the hallowings of all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> preparation is made for receiving or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Consequently, the reception of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for starting the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, while the receiving of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is requisite for its consummation; by partaking not indeed actually, but in desire, as an end is possessed in desire and intention. Another difference is because by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> a man is ordained to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, and therefore from the fact of children being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, they are destined by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>; and just as they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> through the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so they desire the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> through the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, and, as a result, receive its reality. But they are not disposed for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> by any previous sacrament, and consequently before receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, in no way have they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> in desire; but adults alone have: consequently, they cannot have the reality of the sacrament without receiving the sacrament itself. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the same way as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, explaining <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse54">John 6:54</a>, "This food and this drink," namely, of His flesh and blood: "He would have us understand the fellowship of His body and members, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in His <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, and called, and justified, and glorified, His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> ones." Hence, as he says in his Epistle to Boniface (Pseudo-Beda, in <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>): "No one should entertain the slightest <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that then every one of the faithful becomes a partaker of the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> he is made a member of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body; nor is he deprived of his share in that body and <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> even though he depart from this world in the unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, before he eats that bread and drinks of that <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The difference between corporeal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food lies in this, that the former is changed into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> nourished, and consequently it cannot avail for supporting life except it be partaken of; but <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food changes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> into itself, according to that saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Confess. vii), that he heard the voice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as it were saying to him: "Nor shalt thou change Me into thyself, as food of thy flesh, but thou shalt be changed into Me." But one can be changed into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and be incorporated in Him by <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> desire, even without receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And consequently the comparison does not hold.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, according as a man is born anew in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in virtue of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> according as a man is made perfect in union with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who suffered. Hence, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is called the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, which is the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, so the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is termed the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>, which is "the bond of perfection" (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse14">Colossians 3:14</a>).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether this sacrament is suitably called by various names?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not suitably called by various names. For names should correspond with things. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is one, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore, it ought not to be called by various names.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is not properly denominated by what is common to the whole genus. But the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>; and it is common to all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to be conferred by them, which the name "<a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>" denotes, for it is the same thing as "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Furthermore, all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> bring us help on our journey through this present life, which is the notion conveyed by "Viaticum." Again something sacred is done in all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which belongs to the notion of "Sacrifice"; and the faithful intercommunicate through all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which this Greek word <em>Synaxis</em> and the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> "Communio" express. Therefore, these names are not suitably adapted to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a host [From Latin "hostia," a victim] seems to be the same as a sacrifice. Therefore, as it is not properly called a sacrifice, so neither is it properly termed a "Host."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> is the use of these expressions by the faithful.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This sacrament has a threefold significance. one with regard to the past, inasmuch as it is commemorative of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, which was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice, as stated above (Question 48, Article 3), and in this respect it is called a "Sacrifice."

<p>With regard to the present it has another meaning, namely, that of Ecclesiastical unity, in which men are aggregated through this Sacrament; and in this respect it is called "Communion" or <em>Synaxis</em>. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv) that "it is called Communion because we communicate with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through it, both because we partake of His flesh and Godhead, and because we communicate with and are united to one another through it."

<p>With regard to the future it has a third meaning, inasmuch as this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> foreshadows the Divine fruition, which shall come to pass in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; and according to this it is called "Viaticum," because it supplies the way of winning thither. And in this respect it is also called the "<a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>," that is, "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>," because "the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is life everlasting" (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>); or because it really contains <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is "full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>."

<p>In Greek, moreover, it is called <em>Metalepsis</em>, i.e. "<a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Assumption</a>," because, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv), "we thereby assume the Godhead of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is nothing to hinder the same thing from being called by several names, according to its various properties or effects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> What is common to all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is attributed antonomastically to this one on account of its excellence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This sacrament is called a "Sacrifice" inasmuch as it represents the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> of Christ; but it is termed a "Host" inasmuch as it contains <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is "a host (<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'sacrifice') . . . of sweetness" (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians 5:2</a>).

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the institution of this sacrament was appropriate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the institution of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was not appropriate, because as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Gener. ii): "We are nourished by the things from whence we spring." But by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, we receive our <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> being, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. ii). Therefore we are also nourished by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Consequently there was no need to institute this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> nourishment.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, men are united with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as the members with the head. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Head of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, even of those who have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> from the beginning of the world, as stated above (8, 3,6). Therefore the institution of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should not have been postponed till the Lord's supper.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is called the memorial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat026.htm">Matthew 26</a> (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse19">Luke 22:19</a>): "Do this for a commemoration of Me." But a commemoration is of things past. Therefore, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should not have been instituted before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a man is prepared by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which ought to be given only to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> after His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, as is evident from <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>. Therefore, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was not suitably instituted before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> This sacrament was instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of Whom it is said (<a href="../bible/mar007.htm#verse37">Mark 7:37</a>) that "He did all things well."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This sacrament was appropriately instituted at the supper, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> conversed with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> for the last time. First of all, because of what is contained in the sacrament: for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is Himself contained in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> sacramentally. Consequently, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was going to leave His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in His proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, He left Himself with them under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; as the Emperor's image is set up to be reverenced in his absence. Hence <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> says: "Since He was going to withdraw His assumed body from their eyes, and bear it away to the stars, it was needful that on the day of the supper He should <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the sacrament of His body and blood for our sakes, in order that what was once offered up for our ransom should be fittingly worshiped in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>."

<p>Secondly, because without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> there could never be any <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse25">Romans 3:25</a>: "Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed to be a propitiation, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His blood." It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> accordingly that there should be at all times among men something to show forth <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>; the chief sacrament of which in the old Law was the Paschal Lamb. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our Pasch is sacrificed." But its successor under the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which is a remembrance of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> now past, just as the other was figurative of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> to come. And so it was fitting that when the hour of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was come, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should institute a new Sacrament after celebrating the old, as Pope Leo I says (Serm. lviii).

<p>Thirdly, because last words, chiefly such as are spoken by departing friends, are committed most deeply to <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>; since then especially affection for friends is more enkindled, and the things which affect us most are impressed the deepest in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently, since, as Pope Alexander I says, "among <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> there can be none greater than the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor any more powerful oblation"; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> instituted this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> at His last parting with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, in order that it might be held in the greater veneration. And this is what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Respons. ad Januar. i): "In order to commend more earnestly the death of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, our Saviour willed this last act to be fixed in the hearts and memories of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> whom He was about to quit for the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We are nourished from the same things of which we are made, but they do not come to us in the same way; for those out of which we are made come to us through generation, while the same, as nourishing us, come to us through being eaten. Hence, as we are new-born in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, so through the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> we eat <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is the perfect sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, as containing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> crucified; consequently it could not be instituted before <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>; but then there was room for only such <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> as were prefigurative of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This sacrament was instituted during the supper, so as in the future to be a memorial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> as accomplished. Hence He said expressively: "As often as ye shall do these things" [Cf. Canon of the Mass, speaking of the future.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The institution responds to the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. But the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, although after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> in the receiving, is yet previous to it in <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>; and therefore it behooved to be instituted first. or else it can be said that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was already instituted in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; hence some were already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as we read in <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse22">John 3:22</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the Paschal Lamb was the chief figure of this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the Paschal Lamb was not the chief figure of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because (<a href="../bible/psa109.htm#verse4">Psalm 109:4</a>) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called "a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>," since <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> bore the figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sacrifice, in offering bread and wine. But the expression of likeness <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> one thing to be named from another. Therefore, it seems that <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech's</a> offering was the "principal" figure of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the passage of the Red Sea was a figure of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 10:2</a>: "All . . . were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the cloud and in the sea." But the immolation of the Paschal Lamb was previous to the passage of the Red Sea, and the Manna came after it, just as the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> follows <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore the Manna is a more expressive figure of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> than the Paschal Lamb.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the principal power of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is that it brings us into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, being a kind of "viaticum." But this was chiefly prefigured in the sacrament of expiation when the "<a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> entered once a year into the Holy of Holies with blood," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> proves in <a href="../bible/heb009.htm">Hebrews 9</a>. Consequently, it seems that that sacrifice was a more significant figure of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> than was the Paschal Lamb.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 5:7-8</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our Pasch is sacrificed; therefore let us feast . . . with the unleavened bread of sincerity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We can consider three things in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: namely, that which is sacrament only, and this is the bread and wine; that which is both reality and sacrament, to wit, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body; and lastly that which is reality only, namely, the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Consequently, in relation to what is sacrament only, the chief figure of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was the oblation of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, who offered up bread and wine. In relation to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> crucified, Who is contained in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, its figures were all the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, especially the sacrifice of expiation, which was the most <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> of all. While with regard to its effect, the chief figure was the Manna, "having in it the sweetness of every taste" (<a href="../bible/wis016.htm#verse20">Wisdom 16:20</a>), just as the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> refreshes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in all respects.

<p>The Paschal Lamb foreshadowed this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in these three ways. First of all, because it was eaten with unleavened loaves, according to <a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse8">Exodus 12:8</a>: "They shall eat flesh . . . and unleavened bread." As to the second because it was immolated by the entire multitude of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> on the fourteenth day of the moon; and this was a figure of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, Who is called the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> on account of His innocence. As to the effect, because by the blood of the Paschal Lamb the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were preserved from the destroying Angel, and brought from the Egyptian captivity; and in this respect the Paschal Lamb is the chief figure of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because it represents it in every respect.

<p>From this the answer to the Objections is manifest.
