<h1>Question 73. The things that belong to the seventh day</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1073.htm#article1"> The completion of the works</a> <li><a href="../summa/1073.htm#article2"> The resting of God</a> <li><a href="../summa/1073.htm#article3"> The blessing and sanctifying of this day</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the completion of the Divine works ought to be ascribed to the seventh day?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the completion of the Divine works ought not to be ascribed to the seventh day. For all things that are done in this world belong to the Divine works. But the consummation of the world will be at the end of the world (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse39">Matthew 13:39-40</a>). Moreover, the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is a time of completion, wherefore it is called "the time of fulness [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the fulness of time']" (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4</a>). And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, at the moment of His death, cried out, "It is consummated" (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse30">John 19:30</a>). Hence the completion of the Divine works does not belong to the seventh day.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the completion of a work is an act in itself. But we do not read that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acted at all on the seventh day, but rather that He rested from all His work. Therefore the completion of the works does not belong to the seventh day.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing is said to be complete to which many things are added, unless they are merely superfluous, for a thing is called perfect to which nothing is wanting that it ought to possess. But many things were made after the seventh day, as the production of many <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> beings, and even of certain new <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> that are frequently appearing, especially in the case of animals generated from putrefaction. Also, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> creates daily new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Again, the work of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> was a new work, of which it is said (<a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse22">Jeremiah 31:22</a>): "The Lord hath <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> a new thing upon the earth." Miracles also are new works, of which it is said (<a href="../bible/sir036.htm#verse6">Ecclesiasticus 36:6</a>): "Renew thy signs, and work new <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>." Moreover, all things will be made new when the Saints are glorified, according to <a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse5">Apocalypse 21:5</a>: "And He that sat on the throne said: Behold I make all things new." Therefore the completion of the Divine works ought not to be attributed to the seventh day.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse2">Genesis 2:2</a>): "On the seventh day <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ended His work which He had made."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The perfection of a thing is twofold, the first perfection and the second perfection. The 'first' perfection is that according to which a thing is substantially perfect, and this perfection is the form of the whole; which form results from the whole having its parts complete. But the 'second' perfection is the end, which is either an operation, as the end of the harpist is to play the harp; or something that is attained by an operation, as the end of the builder is the house that he makes by building. But the first perfection is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the second, because the form is the principle of operation. Now the final perfection, which is the end of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, is the perfect beatitude of the Saints at the consummation of the world; and the first perfection is the completeness of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> at its first founding, and this is what is ascribed to the seventh day.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The first perfection is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the second, as above said. Now for the attaining of beatitude two things are required, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore, as said above, the perfection of beatitude will be at the end of the world. But this consummation <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> previously in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, at the first founding of the world, as to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For, "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John 1:17</a>). So, then, on the seventh day was the consummation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> the consummation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and at the end of the world will be the consummation of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did act on the seventh day, not by creating new creatures, but by directing and moving His creatures to the work proper to them, and thus He made some beginning of the "second" perfection. So that, according to our version of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, the completion of the works is attributed to the seventh day, though according to another it is assigned to the sixth. Either version, however, may stand, since the completion of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as to the completeness of its parts belongs to the sixth day, but its completion as regards their operation, to the seventh. It may also be added that in continuous movement, so long as any movement further is possible, movement cannot be called completed till it comes to rest, for rest denotes consummation of movement. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> might have made many other creatures besides those which He made in the six days, and hence, by the fact that He ceased making them on the seventh day, He is said on that day to have consummaed His work.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing entirely new was afterwards made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but all things subsequently made had in a sense been made before in the work of the six days. Some things, indeed, had a previous experience materially, as the rib from the side of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> out of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> formed Eve; whilst others <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> not only in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> but also in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as those <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> creatures that are now generated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the first of their kind. Species, also, that are new, if any such appear, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> beforehand in various active powers; so that animals, and perhaps even new <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of animals, are produced by putrefaction by the power which the stars and elements received at the beginning. Again, animals of new kinds arise occasionally from the connection of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> belonging to different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as the mule is the offspring of an ass and a mare; but even these <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> previously in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, in the works of the six days. Some also <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> beforehand by way of similitude, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> now <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. And the work of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> itself was thus foreshadowed, for as we read (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a>), The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> "was made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." And again, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> was anticipated in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by way of similitude; and that of the body in the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, especially the empyrean. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse10">Ecclesiastes 1:10</a>), "Nothing under the sun is new, for it hath already gone before, in the ages that were before us."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether God rested on the seventh day from all His work?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not rest on the seventh day from all His work. For it is said (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse17">John 5:17</a>), "My Father worketh until now, and I work." <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, did not rest on the seventh day from all His work.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, rest is opposed to movement, or to labor, which movement <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. But, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produced His work without movement and without labor, He cannot be said to have rested on the seventh day from His work.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, should it be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rested on the seventh day by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to rest; against this it may be argued that rest is set down in contradistinction to His work; now the words "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>" or "made" this thing or the other cannot be explained to mean that He made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> create or make these things. Therefore the resting of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be explained as His making <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to rest.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse2">Genesis 2:2</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rested on the seventh day from all the work which He had done."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Rest is, properly speaking, opposed to movement, and consequently to the labor that arises from movement. But although movement, strictly speaking, is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of bodies, yet the word is applied also to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, and in a twofold sense. On the one hand, every operation may be called a movement, and thus the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is said to move and go forth to its object, in communicating itself to that object, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. ii). On the other hand, the desire that tends to an object outside itself, is said to move towards it. Hence rest is taken in two senses, in one sense meaning a cessation from work, in the other, the satisfying of desire. Now, in either sense <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to have rested on the seventh day.

<p>First, because He ceased from creating new creatures on that day, for, as said above (1, ad 3), He made nothing afterwards that had not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> previously, in some degree, in the first works; secondly, because He Himself had no need of the things that He had made, but was <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in the fruition of Himself. Hence, when all things were made He is not said to have rested "in" His works, as though needing them for His own <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but to have rested "from" them, as in fact resting in Himself, as He suffices for Himself and fulfils His own desire. And even though from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> He rested in Himself, yet the rest in Himself, which He took after He had finished His works, is that rest which belongs to the seventh day. And this, says <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, is the meaning of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> resting from His works on that day (Gen. ad lit. iv).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> indeed "worketh until now" by preserving and providing for the creatures He has made, but not by the making of new ones.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Rest is here not opposed to labor or to movement, but to the production of new creatures, and to the desire tending to an external object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rests in Himself alone and is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in the enjoyment of Himself, so our own sole <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> lies in the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus, also, He makes us find rest in Himself, both from His works and our own. It is not, then, unreasonable to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rested in giving rest to us. Still, this explanation must not be set down as the only one, and the other is the first and principal explanation.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether blessing and sanctifying are due to the seventh day?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and sanctifying are not due to the seventh day. For it is usual to call a time blessed or <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> for that some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing has happened in it, or some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> been avoided. But whether <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works or ceases from work nothing accrues to Him or is lost to Him. Therefore no special <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> or sanctifying are due to the seventh day.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> "benedictio" [<a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>] is derived from "bonitas" [<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>]. But it is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to spread and communicate itself, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). The days, therefore, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produced creatures deserved a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> rather than the day on which He ceased producing them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, over each creature a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> was pronounced, as upon each work it was said, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Therefore it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that after all had been produced, the seventh day should be blessed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse3">Genesis 2:3</a>), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He had rested from all His work."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> rest on the seventh day is understood in two ways.

<p>First, in that He ceased from producing new works, though He still preserves and provides for the creatures He has made.

<p>Secondly, in that after all His works He rested in Himself. According to the first meaning, then, a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> befits the seventh day, since, as we explained (72, ad 4), the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> referred to the increase by multiplication; for which reason <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said to the creatures which He blessed: "Increase and multiply." Now, this increase is effected through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Providence over His creatures, securing the generation of like from like. And according to the second meaning, it is right that the seventh day should have been sanctified, since the special sanctification of every creature consists in resting in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this reason things dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are said to be sanctified.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The seventh day is said to be sanctified not because anything can accrue to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or be taken from Him, but because something is added to creatures by their multiplying, and by their resting in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the first six days creatures were produced in their first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, but after being thus produced, they are multiplied and preserved, and this work also belongs to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. And the perfection of this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is made most clear by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that in it alone <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> finds His own rest, and we may find ours in its fruition.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> mentioned in the works of each day belongs to the first institution of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> attached to the seventh day, to its propagation.
