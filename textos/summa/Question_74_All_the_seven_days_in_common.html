<h1>Question 74. All the seven days in common</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1074.htm#article1"> The sufficiency of these days</a> <li><a href="../summa/1074.htm#article2"> Are they all one day, or more than one?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1074.htm#article3"> Certain modes of speaking which Scripture uses in narrating the works of the six days</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether these days are sufficiently enumerated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that these days are not sufficiently enumerated. For the work of creation is no less distinct from the works of distinction and adornment than these two works are from one another. But separate days are assigned to distinction and to adornment, and therefore separate days should be assigned to creation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, air and fire are nobler elements than earth and water. But one day is assigned to the distinction of water, and another to the distinction of the land. Therefore, other days ought to be devoted to the distinction of fire and air.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fish differ from birds as much as birds differ from the beasts of the earth, whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> differs more from other animals than all animals whatsoever differ from each other. But one day is devoted to the production of fishes, and another to that of the beast of the earth. Another day, then, ought to be assigned to the production of birds and another to that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it would seem, on the other hand, that some of these days are superfluous. Light, for instance, stands to the luminaries in the relation of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> to subject. But the subject is produced at the same time as the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> proper to it. The light and the luminaries, therefore, ought not to have been produced on different days.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, these days are devoted to the first instituting of the world. But as on the seventh day nothing was instituted, that day ought not to be enumerated with the others.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The reason of the distinction of these days is made clear by what has been said above (Question 70, Article 1), namely, that the parts of the world had first to be distinguished, and then each part adorned and filled, as it were, by the beings that inhabit it. Now the parts into which the corporeal creation is divided are three, according to some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writers, these parts being the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, or highest part, the water, or middle part, and the earth, or the lowest part. Thus the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoreans</a> teach that perfection consists in three things, the beginning, the middle, and the end. The first part, then, is distinguished on the first day, and adorned on the fourth, the middle part distinguished on the middle day, and adorned on the fifth, and the third part distinguished on the third day, and adorned on the sixth. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, while agreeing with the above writers as to the last three days, differs as to the first three, for, according to him, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures are formed on the first day, and corporeal on the two others, the higher bodies being formed on the first these two days, and the lower on the second. Thus, then, the perfection of the Divine works corresponds to the perfection of the number six, which is the sum of its aliquot parts, one, two, three; since one day is assigned to the forming of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures, two to that of corporeal creatures, and three to the work of adornment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, the work of creation belongs to the production of formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and of the formless <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, both of which are outside of time, as he himself says (Confess. xii, 12). Thus, then, the creation of either is set down before there was any day. But it may also be said, following other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writers, that the works of distinction and adornment imply certain changes in the creature which are measurable by time; whereas the work of creation lies only in the Divine act producing the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of beings instantaneously. For this reason, therefore, every work of distinction and adornment is said to take place "in a day," but creation "in the beginning" which denotes something indivisible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fire and air, as not distinctly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the unlettered, are not expressly named by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> among the parts of the world, but reckoned with the intermediate part, or water, especially as regards the lowest part of the air; or with the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, to which the higher region of air approaches, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 13).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The production of animals is recorded with reference to their adorning the various parts of the world, and therefore the days of their production are separated or united according as the animals adorn the same parts of the world, or different parts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of light, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in a subject, was made on the first day; and the making of the luminaries on the fourth day does not mean that their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> was produced anew, but that they then received a form that they had not before, as said above (70, 1 ad 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. iv, 15), after all that has been recorded that is assigned to the six days, something distinct is attributed to the seventh--namely, that on it <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rested in Himself from His works: and for this reason it was right that the seventh day should be mentioned after the six. It may also be said, with the other writers, that the world entered on the seventh day upon a new state, in that nothing new was to be added to it, and that therefore the seventh day is mentioned after the six, from its being devoted to cessation from work.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether all these days are one day?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all these days are one day. For it is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse4">Genesis 2:4-5</a>): "These are the generations of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth, when they were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, in the day that the Lord . . . made the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth, and every plant of the field, before it sprung up in the earth." Therefore the day in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made "the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth, and every plant of the field," is one and the same day. But He made the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth on the first day, or rather before there was any day, but the plant of the field He made on the third day. Therefore the first and third days are but one day, and for a like reason all the rest.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is said (<a href="../bible/sir018.htm#verse1">Sirach 18:1</a>): "He that liveth for ever, <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> all things together." But this would not be the case if the days of these works were more than one. Therefore they are not many but one only.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, on the seventh day <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ceased from all new works. If, then, the seventh day is distinct from the other days, it follows that He did not make that day; which is not admissible.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the entire work ascribed to one day <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perfected in an instant, for with each work are the words (<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>) "said . . . . and it was . . . done." If, then, He had kept back His next work to another day, it would follow that for the remainder of a day He would have ceased from working and left it vacant, which would be superfluous. The day, therefore, of the preceding work is one with the day of the work that follows.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm">Genesis 1</a>), "The evening and the morning were the second day . . . the third day," and so on. But where there is a second and third there are more than one. There was not, therefore, only one day.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> On this question <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> differs from other expositors. His opinion is that all the days that are called seven, are one day represented in a sevenfold aspect (Gen. ad lit. iv, 22; De Civ. Dei xi, 9; Ad Orosium xxvi); while others consider there were seven distinct days, not one only. Now, these two opinions, taken as explaining the literal text of Genesis, are certainly widely different. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> understands by the word "day," the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and hence, according to him, the first day denotes their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the first of the Divine works, the second day their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the second work, and similarly with the rest. Thus, then, each work is said to have been wrought in some one of these days, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wrought in some one of these days, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wrought nothing in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> without impressing the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> thereof on the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind; which can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> many things at the same time, especially in the Word, in Whom all <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is perfected and terminated. So the distinction of days denotes the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order of the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and not a succession in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> acquired, or in the things produced. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is appropriately called "day," since light, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of day, is to be found in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (Gen. ad lit. iv, 28). In the opinion of the others, however, the days signify a succession both in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and in the things produced.

<p>If, however, these two explanations are looked at as referring to the mode of production, they will be found not greatly to differ, if the diversity of opinion <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> on two points, as already shown (67, 1; 69, 1), between <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> and other writers is taken into account.

<p>First, because <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> takes the earth and the water as first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, to signify <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> totally without form; but the making of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, the gathering of the waters, and the appearing of dry land, to denote the impression of forms upon corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writers take the earth and the water, as first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, to signify the elements of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> themselves <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> under the proper forms, and the works that follow to mean some sort of distinction in bodies previously <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, as also has been shown (67, 1,4; 69, 1).

<p>Secondly, some writers hold that plants and animals were produced actually in the work of the six days; <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, that they were produced <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. Now the opinion of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, that the works of the six days were simultaneous, is consistent with either view of the mode of production. For the other writers agree with him that in the first production of things <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> under the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the elements, and agree with him also that in the first instituting of the world animals and plants did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> actually. There remains, however, a difference as to four points; since, according to the latter, there was a time, after the production of creatures, in which light did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> had not been formed, and the earth was still covered by the waters, nor had the heavenly bodies been formed, which is the fourth difference; which are not consistent with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> explanation. In order, therefore, to be impartial, we must meet the arguments of either side.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> On the day on which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth, He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> also every plant of the field, not, indeed, actually, but "before it sprung up in the earth," that is, <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. And this work <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> ascribes to the third day, but other writers to the first instituting of the world.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> all things together so far as regards their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in some measure formless. But He did not create all things together, so far as regards that formation of things which lies in distinction and adornment. Hence the word "creation" is significant.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> On the seventh day <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ceased from making new things, but not from providing for their increase, and to this latter work it belongs that the first day is succeeded by other days.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> All things were not distinguished and adorned together, not from a want of power on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> part, as requiring time in which to work, but that due order might be observed in the instituting of the world. Hence it was fitting that different days should be assigned to the different states of the world, as each succeeding work added to the world a fresh state of perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, the order of days refers to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order of the works attributed to the days.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Scripture uses suitable words to express the work of the six days?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> does not use suitable words to express the works of the six days. For as light, the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, and other similar works were made by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, so were the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth. For "all things were made by Him" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John 1:3</a>). Therefore in the creation of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, as in the other works, mention should have been made of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the water was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet its creation is not mentioned. Therefore the creation of the world is not sufficiently described.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is said (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis 1:31</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw all the things that He had made, and they were very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." It ought, then, to have been said of each work, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." The <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, therefore, of these words in the work of creation and in that of the second day, is not fitting.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. But it does not befit <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to move and to occupy place. Therefore the words, "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> moved over the waters," are unbecoming.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, what is already made is not made over again. Therefore to the words, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said: Let the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> be made . . . and it was so," it is superfluous to add, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>." And the like is to be said of other works.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, evening and morning do not sufficiently divide the day, since the day has many parts. Therefore the words, "The evening and morning were the second day" or, "the third day," are not suitable.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, "first," not "one," corresponds to "second" and "third." It should therefore have been said that, "The evening and the morning were the first day," rather than "one day."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. i, 4), the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is mentioned both in the first creation of the world, and in its distinction and adornment, but differently in either place. For distinction and adornment belong to the work by which the world receives its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But as the giving form to a work of art is by means of the form of the art in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the artist, which may be called his intelligible word, so the giving form to every creature is by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and for this reason in the works of distinction and adornment the Word is mentioned. But in creation the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is mentioned as the beginning, by the words, "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>," since by creation is understood the production of formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But according to those who hold that the elements were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> from the first under their proper forms, another explanation must be given; and therefore <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> says (Hom. ii, iii in Hexaem.) that the words, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said," signify a Divine command. Such a command, however, could not have been given before creatures had been produced that could obey it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei ix, 33), by the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is understood the formless <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and by the earth, the formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of all corporeal things, and thus no creature is omitted. But, according to <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> (Hom. i in Hexaem.), the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth, as the two extremes, are alone mentioned, the intervening things being left to be understood, since all these move heavenwards, if light, or earthwards, if heavy. And others say that under the word, "earth," <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> is accustomed to include all the four elements as (<a href="../bible/psa148.htm#verse7">Psalm 148:7-8</a>) after the words, "Praise the Lord from the earth," is added, "fire, hail, snow, and ice."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the account of the creation there is found something to correspond to the words, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," used in the work of distinction and adornment, and this appears from the consideration that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is Love. Now, "there are two things," says <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. i, 8) which came from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love of His creatures, their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and their permanence. That they might then <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> permanently, "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>," it is said, "moved over the waters"--that is to say, over that formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, signified by water, even as the love of the artist moves over the materials of his art, that out of them he may form his work. And the words, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," signify that the things that He had made were to endure, since they express a certain satisfaction taken by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His works, as of an artist in his art: not as though He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the creature otherwise, or that the creature was pleasing to Him otherwise, than before He made it. Thus in either work, of creation and of formation, the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of Persons is implied. In creation the Person of the Father is indicated by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>, the Person of the Son by the beginning, in which He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, and the Person of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> that moved over the waters. But in the formation, the Person of the Father is indicated by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that speaks, and the Person of the Son by the Word in which He speaks, and the Person of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by the satisfaction with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw that what was made was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And if the words, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," are not said of the work of the second day, this is because the work of distinguishing the waters was only begun on that day, but perfected on the third. Hence these words, that are said of the third day, refer also to the second. Or it may be that <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> does not use these words of approval of the second days' work, because this is concerned with the distinction of things not evident to the senses of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Or, again, because by the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> is simply understood the cloudy region of the air, which is not one of the permanent parts of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, nor of the principal divisions of the world. The above three reasons are given by <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a> [Perplex. ii.], and to these may be added a mystical one derived from numbers and assigned by some writers, according to whom the work of the second day is not marked with approval because the second number is an imperfect number, as receding from the perfection of unity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a> (Perplex. ii) understands by the "<a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>," the air or the wind, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> also did, and says that it is so called according to the custom of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, in which these things are throughout attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But according to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writers, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> signifies the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is said to "move over the water"--that is to say, over what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> holds to mean formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, lest it should be supposed that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loved of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> the works He was to produce, as though He stood in need of them. For love of that kind is subject to, not superior to, the object of love. Moreover, it is fittingly implied that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> moved over that which was incomplete and unfinished, since that movement is not one of place, but of pre-eminent power, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. i, 7). It is the opinion, however, of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> (Hom. ii in Hexaem.) that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> moved over the element of water, "fostering and quickening its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and impressing vital power, as the hen broods over her chickens." For water has especially a life-giving power, since many animals are generated in water, and the seed of all animals is liquid. Also the life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is given by the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>: "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. i, 8), these three phrases denote the threefold being of creatures; first, their being in the Word, denoted by the command "Let . . . be made"; secondly, their being in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind, signified by the words, "It was . . . done"; thirdly, their being in their proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, by the words, "He made." And because the formation of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is recorded on the first day, it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> there to add, "He made." It may also be said, following other writers, that the words, "He said," and "Let . . . be made," denote <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> command, and the words, "It was done," the fulfilment of that command. But as it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for the sake of those especially who have asserted that all visible things were made by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, to mention how things were made, it is added, in order to remove that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself made them. Hence, in each work, after the words, "It was done," some act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is expressed by some such words as, "He made," or, "He divided," or, "He called."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. iv, 22,30), by the "evening" and the "morning" are understood the evening and the morning <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which has been explained (58, 6,7). But, according to <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> (Hom. ii in Hexaem.), the entire period takes its name, as is customary, from its more important part, the day. And instance of this is found in the words of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, "The days of my pilgrimage," where night is not mentioned at all. But the evening and the morning are mentioned as being the ends of the day, since day begins with morning and ends with evening, or because evening denotes the beginning of night, and morning the beginning of day. It seems fitting, also, that where the first distinction of creatures is described, divisions of time should be denoted only by what marks their beginning. And the reason for mentioning the evening first is that as the evening ends the day, which begins with the light, the termination of the light at evening precedes the termination of the darkness, which ends with the morning. But <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> explanation is that thereby it is intended to show that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> day does not end with the evening, but with the morning (Hom. v in Gen.).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The words "one day" are used when day is first instituted, to denote that one day is made up of twenty-four hours. Hence, by mentioning "one," the measure of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> day is fixed. Another reason may be to signify that a day is completed by the return of the sun to the point from which it commenced its course. And yet another, because at the completion of a week of seven days, the first day returns which is one with the eighth day. The three reasons assigned above are those given by <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> (Hom. ii in Hexaem.).
