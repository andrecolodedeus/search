<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the matter of this sacrament is bread and wine?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not bread and wine. Because this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought to represent <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> more fully than did the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. But the flesh of animals, which was the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, shows forth <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> more fully than bread and wine. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought rather to be the flesh of animals than bread and wine.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is to be celebrated in every place. But in many lands bread is not to be found, and in many places wine is not to be found. Therefore bread and wine are not a suitable <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is for both hale and weak. But to some weak <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> wine is hurtful. Therefore it seems that wine ought not to be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Alexander I says (Ep. ad omnes orth. i): "In oblations of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> only bread and wine mixed with water are to be offered."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have fallen into various <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> about the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Some, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the Artotyrytae, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Haeres. xxviii), "offer bread and cheese in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, contending that oblations were celebrated by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the first ages, from fruits of the earth and sheep." Others, called Cataphrygae and Pepuziani, "are reputed to have made their Eucharistic bread with infants' blood drawn from tiny punctures over the entire body, and mixed with flour." Others, styled Aquarii, under guise of sobriety, offer nothing but water in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>Now all these and similar <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> are excluded by the fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> instituted this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of bread and wine, as is evident from <a href="../bible/mat026.htm">Matthew 26</a>. Consequently, bread and wine are the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And the reasonableness of this is seen first, in the use of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which is eating: for, as water is used in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> cleansing, since bodily cleansing is commonly done with water; so bread and wine, wherewith men are commonly fed, are employed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> for the use of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating.

<p>Secondly, in relation to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, in which the blood was separated from the body. And therefore in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which is the memorial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, the bread is received apart as the sacrament of the body, and the wine as the sacrament of the blood.

<p>Thirdly, as to the effect, considered in each of the partakers. For, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (Mag. Sent. iv, D, xi) says on <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 11:20</a>, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> "avails for the defense of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body"; and therefore "Christ's body is offered" under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of bread "for the health of the body, and the blood" under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of wine "for the health of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," according to <a href="../bible/lev017.htm#verse14">Leviticus 17:14</a>: "The life of the animal [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'of all flesh'] is in the blood."

<p>Fourthly, as to the effect with regard to the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is made up of many believers, just "as bread is composed of many grains, and wine flows from many grapes," as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes on <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>: "We being many are . . . one body," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the flesh of slaughtered animals represents the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> more forcibly, nevertheless it is less suitable for the common use of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and for denoting the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although wheat and wine are not produced in every country, yet they can easily be conveyed to every land, that is, as much as is needful for the use of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: at the same time one is not to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> when the other is lacking, because it would not be a complete sacrament.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Wine taken in small <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> cannot do the sick much harm: yet if there be fear of harm, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for all who take <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body to partake also of His blood, as will be stated later (80, 12).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a determinate quantity of bread and wine is required for the matter of this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a determinate <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of bread and wine is required for the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Because the effects of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are no less set in order than those of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But, "there is a limit set by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> upon all <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things, and a reckoning of size and development" (De Anima ii). Consequently, in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which is called "<a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>," that is, "a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>," a determinate <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the bread and wine is required.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave no power to the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> regarding matters which involve derision of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and of His <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse8">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>: "Of our power which the Lord hath given us unto edification, and not for your destruction." But it would lead to mockery of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> were to wish to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> all the bread which is sold in the market and all the wine in the cellar. Therefore he cannot do this.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if anyone be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the sea, the entire sea-water is not sanctified by the form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but only the water wherewith the body of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is cleansed. Therefore, neither in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can a superfluous <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of bread be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Much is opposed to little, and great to small. But there is no <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, however small, of the bread and wine which cannot be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Therefore, neither is there any <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, however great, which cannot be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have maintained that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> could not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> an immense <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of bread and wine, for instance, all the bread in the market or all the wine in a cask. But this does not appear to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, because in all things containing <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the reason for the determination of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is drawn from its disposition to an end, just as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a saw is iron, so as to adapt it for cutting. But the end of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is the use of the faithful. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> must be determined by comparison with the use of the faithful. But this cannot be determined by comparison with the use of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who are actually present; otherwise the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> having few parishioners could not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> many hosts. It remains, then, for the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to be determined in reference to the number of the faithful absolutely. But the number of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> is not a determinate one. Hence it cannot be said that the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is restricted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> object has its determinate <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> by comparison with its determinate form. But the number of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, for whose use this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is ordained, is not a determinate one. Consequently there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ministers is ordained for two purposes: first for the proper effect, and secondly for the end of the effect. But the second does not take away the first. Hence, if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> intends to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> purpose, for instance, to make mockery of it, or to administer poison through it, he commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, nevertheless, on account of the power committed to him, he accomplishes the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is perfected in the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: and therefore no more of the water is hallowed than what is used. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is wrought in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Consequently there is no parallel.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether wheaten bread is required for the matter of this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that wheaten bread is not requisite for the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a reminder of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. But barley bread seems to be more in keeping with the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> than wheaten bread, as being more bitter, and because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> used it to feed the multitudes upon the mountain, as narrated in <a href="../bible/joh006.htm">John 6</a>. Therefore wheaten bread is not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things the shape is a sign of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But some cereals resemble wheat, such as spelt and maize, from which in some localities bread is made for the use of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore wheaten bread is not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, mixing dissolves <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But wheaten flour is hardly to be found unmixed with some other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of grain, except in the instance of specially selected grain. Therefore it does not seem that wheaten bread is the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, what is corrupted appears to be of another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But some make the sacrament from bread which is corrupted, and which no longer seems to be wheaten bread. Therefore, it seems that such bread is not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is contained in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and He compares Himself to a grain of wheat, saying (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse24">John 12:24</a>): "Unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, itself remaineth alone." Therefore bread from corn, i.e. wheaten bread, is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), for the use of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> such <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is adopted as is commonly made use of among men. Now among other breads wheaten bread is more commonly used by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; since other breads seem to be employed when this fails. And consequently <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have instituted this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> under this <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of bread. Moreover this bread strengthens <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and so it denotes more suitably the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Consequently, the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is wheaten bread.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Barley bread serves to denote the hardness of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>; both on account of the hardness of the bread, and because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (83): "The flour within the barley, wrapped up as it is within a most tenacious fibre, denotes either the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> itself, which was given in such manner as to be vested in bodily <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; or else it denotes the people themselves, who were not yet despoiled of carnal desires, which clung to their hearts like fibre." But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> "sweet yoke," and to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> already manifested, and to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> people. Consequently barley bread would not be a suitable <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A begetter begets a thing like to itself in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. yet there is some unlikeness as to the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, owing either to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or to weakness within the generative power. And therefore, if there be any cereals which can be grown from the seed of the wheat (as wild wheat from wheat seed grown in bad ground), the bread made from such grain can be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: and this does not obtain either in barley, or in spelt, or even in maize, which is of all grains the one most resembling the wheat grain. But the resemblance as to shape in such seems to denote closeness of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> rather than identity; just as the resemblance in shape between the dog and the wolf goes to show that they are allied but not of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Hence from such grains, which cannot in any way be generated from wheat grain, bread cannot be made such as to be the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A moderate mixing does not alter the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, because that little is as it were absorbed by the greater. Consequently, then, if a small <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of another grain be mixed with a much greater <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of wheat, bread may be made therefrom so as to be the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; but if the mixing be notable, for instance, half and half; or nearly so, then such mixing alters the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; consequently, bread made therefrom will not be the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Sometimes there is such corruption of the bread that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of bread is lost, as when the continuity of its parts is destroyed, and the taste, color, and other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are changed; hence the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> may not be made from such <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But sometimes there is not such corruption as to alter the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but merely disposition towards corruption, which a slight change in the savor betrays, and from such bread the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> may be made: but he who does so, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from irreverence towards the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And because starch comes of corrupted wheat, it does not seem as if the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could be made of the bread made therefrom, although some hold the contrary.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether this sacrament ought to be made of unleavened bread?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought not to be made of unleavened bread. because in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> we ought to imitate <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> institution. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appears to have instituted this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in fermented bread, because, as we have read in <a href="../bible/exo012.htm">Exodus 12</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, began to use unleavened bread on the day of the Passover which is celebrated on the fourteenth day of the moon; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> instituted this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> at the supper which He celebrated "before the festival day of the Pasch" (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse1">John 13:1-4</a>). Therefore we ought likewise to celebrate this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> with fermented bread.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, legal observances ought not to be continued in the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But the use of unleavened bread was a ceremony of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, as is clear from <a href="../bible/exo012.htm">Exodus 12</a>. Therefore we ought not to use unfermented bread in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as stated above (65, 1; 73, 3), the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But the fervor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is signified by fermented bread, as is declared by the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse33">Matthew 13:33</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like unto leaven," etc. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought to be made of leavened bread.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, leavened or unleavened are mere <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of bread, which do not vary the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> no difference is observed regarding the variation of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, as to whether it be salt or fresh, warm or cold water. Therefore neither ought any distinction to be observed, as to whether the bread be unleavened or leavened.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to the Decretals (Extra, De Celebr. Miss.), a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is punished "for presuming to celebrate, using fermented bread and a wooden cup."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things may be considered touching the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> namely, what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and what is suitable. It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the bread be wheaten, without which the sacrament is not valid, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). It is not, however, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the sacrament that the bread be unleavened or leavened, since it can be celebrated in either.

<p>But it is suitable that every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> observe the rite of his Church in the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now in this matter there are various customs of the Churches: for, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says: "The Roman Church offers unleavened bread, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> took flesh without union of sexes: but the Greek Churches offer leavened bread, because the Word of the Father was clothed with flesh; as leaven is mixed with the flour." Hence, as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by celebrating with fermented bread in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, so a Greek <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> celebrating with unfermented bread in a church of the Greeks would also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as perverting the rite of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nevertheless the custom of celebrating with unleavened bread is more reasonable. First, on account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> institution: for He instituted this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> "on the first day of the Azymes" (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse17">Matthew 26:17</a>; <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse12">Mark 14:12</a>; <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse7">Luke 22:7</a>), on which day there ought to be nothing fermented in the houses of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, as is stated in <a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse15">Exodus 12:15-19</a>. Secondly, because bread is properly the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, which was conceived without corruption, rather than of His Godhead, as will be seen later (76, 1, ad 1). Thirdly, because this is more in keeping with the sincerity of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, which is required in the use of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our Pasch is sacrificed: therefore let us feast . . . with the unleavened bread of sincerity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p>However, this custom of the Greeks is not unreasonable both on account of its signification, to which <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> refers, and in detestation of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Nazarenes, who mixed up legal observances with the Gospel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As we read in <a href="../bible/exo012.htm">Exodus 12</a>, the paschal <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> began on the evening of the fourteenth day of the moon. So, then, after immolating the Paschal Lamb, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> instituted this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: hence this day is said by John to precede the day of the Pasch, while the other three Evangelists call it "the first day of the Azymes," when fermented bread was not found in the houses of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, as stated above. Fuller mention was made of this in the treatise on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> (46, 9, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who celebrate the sacrament with unleavened bread do not intend to follow the ceremonial of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, but to conform to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> institution; so they are not Judaizing; otherwise those celebrating in fermented bread would be Judaizing, because the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> offered up fermented bread for the first-fruits.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Leaven denotes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> on account of one single effect, because it makes the bread more savory and larger; but it also signifies corruption from its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since whatever is fermented partakes of corruption, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> may not be made from corrupt bread, as stated above (3, ad 4); consequently, there is a wider difference between unleavened and leavened bread than between warm and cold baptismal water: because there might be such corruption of fermented bread that it could not be validly used for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether wine of the grape is the proper matter of this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that wine of the grape is not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Because, as water is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, so is wine the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> can be conferred with any kind of water. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can be celebrated in any kind of wine, such as of pomegranates, or of mulberries; since vines do not grow in some countries.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, vinegar is a kind of wine drawn from the grape, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. xx). But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> cannot be celebrated with vinegar. Therefore, it seems that wine from the grape is not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the clarified wine is drawn from grapes, so also are the juice of unripe grapes and must. But it does not appear that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> may be made from such, according to what we read in the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Sixth Council</a> (Trull., Can. 28): "We have learned that in some churches the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> add grapes to the sacrifice of the oblation; and so they dispense both together to the people. Consequently we give order that no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall do this in future." And Pope Julius I rebukes some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> "who offer wine pressed from the grape in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">sacrament of the Lord's chalice</a>." Consequently, it seems that wine from the grape is not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> compared Himself to the grain of wheat, so also He compared Himself to the vine, saying (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse1">John 15:1</a>): "I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> vine." But only bread from wheat is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore, only wine from the grape is the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This sacrament can only be performed with wine from the grape. First of all on account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> institution, since He instituted this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in wine from the grape, as is evident from His own words, in instituting this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse29">Matthew 26:29</a>): "I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine." Secondly, because, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), that is adopted as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which is properly and universally considered as such. Now that is properly called wine, which is drawn from the grape, whereas other liquors are called wine from resemblance to the wine of the grape. Thirdly, because the wine from the grape is more in keeping with the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>; because it is written (<a href="../bible/psa103.htm#verse15">Psalm 103:15</a>): "That wine may cheer the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Such liquors are called wine, not properly but only from their resemblance thereto. But genuine wine can be conveyed to such countries wherein the grape-vine does not flourish, in a <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> sufficient for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Wine becomes vinegar by corruption; hence there is no returning from vinegar to wine, as is said in Metaph. viii. And consequently, just as this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> may not be made from bread which is utterly corrupt, so neither can it be made from vinegar. It can, however, be made from wine which is turning sour, just as from bread turning corrupt, although he who does so <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The juice of unripe grapes is at the stage of incomplete generation, and therefore it has not yet the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of wine: on which account it may not be used for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Must, however, has already the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of wine, for its sweetness ["Aut dulcis musti Vulcano decoquit humorem"; Virgil, Georg. i, 295] indicates fermentation which is "the result of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat" (Meteor. iv); consequently this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can be made from must. Nevertheless entire grapes ought not to be mixed with this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because then there would be something else besides wine. It is furthermore forbidden to offer must in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, as soon as it has been squeezed from the grape, since this is unbecoming owing to the impurity of the must. But in case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> it may be done: for it is said by the same Pope Julius, in the passage quoted in the argument: "If <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, let the grape be pressed into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether water should be mixed with the wine?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that water ought not to be mixed with the wine, since Christ's sacrifice was foreshadowed by that of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, who (<a href="../bible/gen014.htm#verse18">Genesis 14:18</a>) is related to have offered up bread and wine only. Consequently it seems that water should not be added in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the various <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> have their respective matters. But water is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore it should not be employed as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, bread and wine are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But nothing is added to the bread. Therefore neither should anything be added to the wine.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Alexander I writes (Ep. 1 ad omnes orth.): "In the sacramental oblations which in mass are offered to the Lord, only bread and wine mixed with water are to be offered in sacrifice."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Water ought to be mingled with the wine which is offered in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. First of all on account of its institution: for it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> with probability that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> instituted this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in wine tempered with water according to the custom of that country: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse5">Proverbs 9:5</a>): "Drink the wine which I have mixed for you." Secondly, because it harmonizes with the representation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: hence Pope Alexander I says (Ep. 1 ad omnes orth.): "In the Lord's <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> neither wine only nor water only ought to be offered, but both mixed because we read that both flowed from His side in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>." Thirdly, because this is adapted for signifying the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, since as Pope Julius says (Concil. Bracarens iii, Can. 1): "We see that the people are signified by the water, but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood by the wine. Therefore when water is mixed with the wine in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, the people is made one with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Fourthly, because this is appropriate to the fourth effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which is the entering into everlasting life: hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. v): "The water flows into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, and springs forth unto everlasting life."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. v), just as Christ's sacrifice is denoted by the offering of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, so likewise it is signified by the water which flowed from the rock in the desert, according to <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>: "But they drank of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> rock which came after them."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> water is used for the purpose of ablution: but in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> it is used by way of refreshment, according to <a href="../bible/psa022.htm#verse3">Psalm 22:3</a>: "He hath brought me up on the water of refreshment."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Bread is made of water and flour; and therefore, since water is mixed with the wine, neither is without water.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the mixing with water is essential to this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the mixing with water is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says to Cecilius (Ep. lxiii): "Thus the Lord's <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is not water only and wine only, but both must be mixed together: in the same way as neither the Lord's body be of flour only, except both," i.e. the flour and the water "be united as one." But the admixture of water with the flour is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Consequently, for the like reason, so is the mixing of water with the wine.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, of which this is the memorial, water as well as blood flowed from His side. But wine, which is the sacrament of the blood, is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For the same reason, therefore, so is water.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if water were not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it would not <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in the least what kind of water was used; and so water distilled from roses, or any other kind might be employed; which is contrary to the usage of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Consequently water is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says (Ep. lxiii): "If any of our predecessors, out of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or simplicity, has not kept this usage," i.e. of mixing water with the wine, "one may pardon his simplicity"; which would not be the case if water were <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as the wine or the bread. Therefore the mingling of water with the wine is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Judgment concerning a sign is to be drawn from the thing signified. Now the adding of water to the wine is for the purpose of signifying the sharing of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, in this respect that by the mixing of the water with the wine is signified the union of the people with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as stated (6). Moreover, the flowing of water from the side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> hanging on the cross refers to the same, because by the water is denoted the cleansing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which was the effect of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. Now it was observed above (73, 1, ad 3), that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is completed in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: while the usage of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but only a consequence thereof. Consequently, then, the adding of water is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian's</a> expression is to be taken in the same sense in which we say that a thing cannot be, which cannot be suitably. And so the comparison refers to what ought to be done, not to what is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to be done; since water is of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of bread, but not of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of wine.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The shedding of the blood belonged directly to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>: for it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for blood to flow from a wounded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. But the flowing of the water was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>; but merely to show its effect, which is to wash away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to refresh us from the heat of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. And therefore the water is not offered apart from the wine in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as the wine is offered apart from the bread; but the water is offered mixed with the wine to show that the wine belongs of itself to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as of its very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; but the water as something added to the wine.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since the mixing of water with the wine is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it does not <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, what kind of water is added to the wine, whether <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> water, or artificial, as rose-water, although, as to the propriety of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, he would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> who mixes any other than <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> water, because <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> water flowed from the side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> hanging on the cross, and not phlegm, as some have said, in order to show that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> composed of the four elements; as by the flowing blood, it was shown to be composed of the four humors, as <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> says in a certain Decree. But because the mixing of water with flour is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as making the composition of bread, if rose-water, or any other liquor besides <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> water, be mixed with the flour, the sacrament would not be valid, because it would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bread.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether water should be added in great quantity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that water ought to be added in great <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, because as blood flowed sensibly from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> side, so did water: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse35">John 19:35</a>): "He that saw it, hath given testimony." But water could not be sensibly present in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> except it were used in great <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Consequently it seems that water ought to be added in great <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a little water mixed with much wine is corrupted. But what is corrupted no longer <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. Therefore, it is the same thing to add a little water in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as to add none. But it is not lawful to add none. Therefore, neither is it lawful to add a little.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if it sufficed to add a little, then as a consequence it would suffice to throw one drop of water into an entire cask. But this seems ridiculous. Therefore it does not suffice for a small <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> to be added.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in the Decretals (Extra, De Celeb. Miss.): "The pernicious abuse has prevailed in your country of adding water in greater <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> than the wine, in the sacrifice, where according to the reasonable custom of the entire Church more wine than water ought to be employed."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is a threefold opinion regarding the water added to the wine, as <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> says in a certain <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a>. For some say that the water remains by itself when the wine is changed into blood: but such an opinion cannot stand, because in the sacrament of the altar after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> there is nothing else save the body and the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Because, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says in De Officiis (De Mysteriis ix): "Before the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> it is another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> that is named, after the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> the Body is signified; otherwise it would not be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with adoration of <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." And therefore others have said that as the wine is changed into blood, so the water is changed into the water which flowed from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> side. But this cannot be maintained reasonably, because according to this the water would be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> apart from the wine, as the wine is from the bread.

<p>And therefore as he (<a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, Decretals, Extra, De Celeb. Miss.) says, the more probable opinion is that which holds that the water is changed into wine, and the wine into blood. Now, this could not be done unless so little water was used that it would be changed into wine. Consequently, it is always safer to add little water, especially if the wine be weak, because the sacrament could not be celebrated if there were such addition of water as to destroy the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the wine. Hence Pope Julius I reprehends some who "keep throughout the year a linen cloth steeped in must, and at the time of sacrifice wash a part of it with water, and so make the offering."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> For the signification of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> it suffices for the water to be appreciable by sense when it is mixed with the wine: but it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for it to be sensible after the mingling.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If no water were added, the signification would be utterly excluded: but when the water is changed into wine, it is signified that the people is incorporated with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If water were added to a cask, it would not suffice for the signification of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but the water must be added to the wine at the actual celebration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.
