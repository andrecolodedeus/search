<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the will is a subject of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be a subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is outside the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>." But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has the character of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is directed either to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or to what seems <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now from the fact that will wishes the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and that it wishes what seems <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, points to a defect in the apprehensive power rather than in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is nowise in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same thing cannot be both subject and efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because "the efficient and the material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> do not coincide" (Phys. 2, text. 70). Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Duabus Anim. x, 10,11). Therefore it is not the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 9) that "it is by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and live righteously."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sin is an act, as stated above (71, A1,6). Now some acts pass into external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, e.g. "to cut" and "to burn": and such acts have for their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and subject, the thing into which the action passes: thus the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Phys. iii, text. 18) that "movement is the act of the thing moved, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a mover." On the other hand, there are acts which do not pass into external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but remain in the agent, e.g. "to desire" and "to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>": and such are all moral acts, whether <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Consequently the proper subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> must needs be the power which is the principle of the act. Now since it is proper to moral acts that they are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as stated above (1, 1 ; 18, 6), it follows that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acts, both of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> acts, and of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> acts or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is the principle of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore it follows that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its subject.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> is said to be outside the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not tend to it under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But since some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is an apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> sometimes desires an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and in this sense is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If the defect in the apprehensive power were nowise subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, there would be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, or in the apprehensive power, as in the case of those whose <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is invincible. It remains therefore that when there is in the apprehensive power a defect that is subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, this defect also is deemed a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument applies to those efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> whose actions pass into external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and which do not move themselves, but move other things; the contrary of which is to be observed in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the will alone is the subject of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> alone is the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Duabus Anim. x, 10) that "no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> except by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>." Now the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the power by which we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> alone is the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> pertaining to reason are the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> alone. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> alone is the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Lib. Arb. iii, 18) [Cf. De Vera Relig. xiv.], "so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is it that every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, that unless it be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, it is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all." Now the acts of the other powers are not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, except in so far as those powers are moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; nor does this suffice for them to be the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because then even the external members of the body, which are moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, would be a subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> alone is the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Sin is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and contraries are about one same thing. But the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, besides the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, are the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (<a href="#56">Article 56</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not the only subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was shown above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), whatever is the a principle of a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act is a subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acts are not only those which are elicited by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but also those which are commanded by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as we stated above (Question 6, Article 4) in treating of voluntariness. Therefore not only the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be a subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also all those powers which can be moved to their acts, or restrained from their acts, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; and these same powers are the subjects of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> moral <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, because act and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> belong to the same subject.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> except by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as first mover; but we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the other powers as moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> pertain to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its proper objects; but the other powers have certain determinate goods and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, by reason of which they can be the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as they partake of will and reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The members of the body are not principles but merely organs of action: wherefore they are compared to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which moves them, as a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> who is moved but moves no other. On the other hand, the internal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers are compared to reason as free agents, because they both act and are acted upon, as is made clear in Polit. i, 3. Moreover, the acts of the external members are actions that pass into external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as may be seen in the blow that is inflicted in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Consequently there is no comparison.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there can be sin in the sensuality?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there cannot be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the sensuality. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is praised or blamed for his actions. Now sensuality is common to us and irrational animals. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be in the sensuality.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in what he cannot avoid," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Lib. Arb. iii, 18). But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot prevent the movement of the sensuality from being inordinate, since "the sensuality ever remains corrupt, so long as we abide in this mortal life; wherefore it is signified by the serpent," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Trin. xii, 12,13). Therefore the inordinate movement of the sensuality is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself does not do is not imputed to him as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now "that alone do we seem to do ourselves, which we do with the deliberation of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 8). Therefore the movement of the sensuality, which is without the deliberation of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is not imputed to a man as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse19">Romans 7:19</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which I will I do not; but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which I will not, that I do": which words <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> explains (Contra Julian. iii, 26; De Verb. Apost. xii, 2,3), as referring to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which is clearly a movement of the sensuality. Therefore there can be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the sensuality.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (2,3), <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be found in any power whose act can be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and inordinate, wherein consists the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it is evident that the act of the sensuality, or sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> inclined to be moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Wherefore it follows that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be in the sensuality.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although some of the powers of the sensitive part are common to us and irrational animals, nevertheless, in us, they have a certain excellence through being united to the reason; thus we surpass other animals in the sensitive part for as much as we have the powers of cogitation and reminiscence, as stated in the I, 78, 4. In the same way our sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> surpasses that of other animals by reason of a certain excellence consisting in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to obey the reason; and in this respect it can be the principle of a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> action, and, consequently, the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The continual corruption of the sensuality is to be understood as referring to the "fomes," which is never completely destroyed in this life, since, though the stain of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> passes, its effect remains. However, this corruption of the "fomes" does not hinder <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from using his rational will to check <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> inordinate movements, if he be presentient to them, for instance by turning his thoughts to other things. Yet while he is turning his thoughts to something else, an inordinate movement may arise about this also: thus when a man, in order to avoid the movements of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, turns his thoughts away from carnal pleasures, to the considerations of science, sometimes an unpremeditated movement of vainglory will arise. Consequently, a man cannot avoid all such movements, on account of the aforesaid corruption: but it is enough, for the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that he be able to avoid each single one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Man does not do perfectly himself what he does without the deliberation of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, since the principal part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does nothing therein: wherefore such is not perfectly a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>; and consequently it cannot be a perfect act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is something imperfect of that kind. Therefore such movement of the sensuality as forestalls the reason, is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is something imperfect in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether mortal sin can be in the sensuality?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be in the sensuality. Because an act is discerned by its object. Now it is possible to commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> about the objects of the sensuality, e.g. about carnal pleasures. Therefore the act of the sensuality can be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be found in the sensuality.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be in the sensuality; for <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the irrational parts, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. iii, 10). Therefore, since it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to contraries to be about the same subject, sensuality can be the subject of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a disposition to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now disposition and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> are in the same subject. Since therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be in the sensuality, as stated above (3, ad 3), mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be there also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 23): "The inordinate movement of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the sensuality, can even be in those who are in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>," in whom, however, mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not to be found. Therefore the inordinate movement of the sensuality is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as a disorder which destroys the principle of the body's life <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the body's death, so too a disorder which destroys the principle of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, viz. the last end, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> death, which is mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 72, Article 5). Now it belongs to the reason alone, and not to the sensuality, to order anything to the end: and disorder in respect of the end can only belong to the power whose function it is to order others to the end. Wherefore mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be in the sensuality, but only in the reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The act of the sensuality can concur towards a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: yet the fact of its being a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is due, not to its being an act of the sensuality, but to its being an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, to whom the ordering to the end belongs. Consequently mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is imputed, not to the sensuality, but to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is perfected not only in that it is an act of the sensuality, but still more in the fact of its being an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and will, whose function it is to choose: for the act of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not without the exercise of choice: wherefore the act of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which perfects the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, is always accompanied by an act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which perfects the rational power; and the same applies to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated (ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A disposition may be related in three ways to that to which it disposes: for sometimes it is the same thing and is in the same subject; thus inchoate science is a disposition to perfect science: sometimes it is in the same subject, but is not the same thing; thus heat is a disposition to the form of fire: sometimes it is neither the same thing, nor in the same subject, as in those things which are subordinate to one another in such a way that we can arrive at one through the other, e.g. <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is a disposition to science which is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. In this way the venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is in the sensuality, may be a disposition to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is in the reason.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether sin can be in the reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be in the reason. For the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of any power is a defect thereof. But the fault of the reason is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, on the contrary, it excuses <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for a man is excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be in the reason.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the primary object of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now reason precedes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, since it directs it. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be in the reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there can be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> except about things which are under our control. Now perfection and defect of reason are not among those things which are under our control: since by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> some are <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> deficient, and some shrewd-minded. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in the reason.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 12) that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in the lower and in the higher reason.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of any power is an act of that power, as we have clearly shown (1,2,3). Now reason has a twofold act: one is its proper act in respect of its proper object, and this is the act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; the other is the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> as directing the other powers. Now in both of these ways there may be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the reason. First, in so far as it <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is imputed to the reason as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when it is in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about what it is able and ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: secondly, when it either commands the inordinate movements of the lower powers, or deliberately fails to check them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers the defect in the proper act of the reason in respect of its proper object, and with regard to the case when it is a defect of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about something which one is unable to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: for then this defect of reason is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as is evident with regard to the actions of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a>. If, however, the defect of reason be about something which a man is able and ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, he is not altogether excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the defect is imputed to him as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The defect which belongs only to the act of directing the other powers, is always imputed to reason as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it can always obviate this defect by means of its proper act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (Question 17, Article 1), when we were treating of the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and reason, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves and precedes the reason, in one way, and the reason moves and precedes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in another: so that both the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be called rational, and the act of the reason, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is found in the reason, either through being a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> defect of the reason, or through the reason being the principle of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> act.

<p>The Reply to the Third Objection is evident from what has been said (ad 1).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the sin of morose delectation is in the reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of morose delectation is not in the reason. For delectation denotes a movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, as stated above (Question 31, Article 1). But the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is distinct from the reason, which is an apprehensive power. Therefore morose delectation is not in the reason.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the object shows to which power an act belongs, since it is through the act that the power is directed to its object. Now a morose delectation is sometimes about sensible goods, and not about the goods of the reason. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of morose delectation is not in the reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a thing is said to be morose [From the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> 'mora'--delay] through taking a length of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. But length of time is no reason why an act should belong to a particular power. Therefore morose delectation does not belong to the reason.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 12) that "if the consent to a sensual delectation goes no further than the mere thought of the pleasure, I deem this to be like as though the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> alone had partaken of the forbidden fruit." Now "the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>" denotes the lower reason, as he himself explains (De Trin. xii, 12). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of morose delectation is in the reason.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated (5), <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be in the reason, not only in respect of reason's proper act, but sometimes in respect of its directing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions. Now it is evident that reason directs not only external acts, but also internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Consequently when the reason fails in directing the internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is said to be in the reason, as also when it fails in directing external actions. Now it fails, in two ways, in directing internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: first, when it commands unlawful <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; for instance, when a man deliberately provokes himself to a movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: secondly, when it fails to check the unlawful movement of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>; for instance, when a man, having deliberately considered that a rising movement of passion is inordinate, continues, notwithstanding, to dwell [immoratur] upon it, and fails to drive it away. And in this sense the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of morose delectation is said to be in the reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Delectation is indeed in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power as its proximate principle; but it is in the reason as its first mover, in accordance with what has been stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), viz. that actions which do not pass into external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are subjected in their principles.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> has its proper elicited act about its proper object; but it exercises the direction of all the objects of those lower powers that can be directed by the reason: and accordingly delectation about sensible objects comes also under the direction of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Delectation is said to be morose not from a delay of time, but because the reason in deliberating dwells [immoratur] thereon, and fails to drive it away, "deliberately holding and turning over what should have been cast aside as soon as it touched the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 12).

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the sin of consent to the act is in the higher reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of consent to the act is not in the higher reason. For consent is an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, as stated above (Question 15, Article 1): whereas the reason is an apprehensive power. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of consent to the act is not in the higher reason.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "the higher reason is intent on contemplating and consulting the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Trin. xii, 7). ['Rationes aeternae,' cf. I, 15, A2,[3] where as in similar passages 'ratio' has been rendered by the English 'type,' because <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> was speaking of the Divine '<a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>' as the archetype of the creature. Hence the type or <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is a rule of conduct, and is identified with the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, (cf. 8, Objection 1; 9)]. But sometimes consent is given to an act, without consulting the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not always think about Divine things, whenever he consents to an act. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of consent to the act is not always in the higher reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can regulate his external actions according to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, so can he regulate his internal pleasures or other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But "consent to a pleasure without deciding to fulfil it by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, belongs to the lower reason," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Trin. xii, 2). Therefore the consent to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act should also be sometimes ascribed to the lower reason.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as the higher reason excels the lower, so does the reason excel the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Now sometimes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> proceeds to act through the apprehension of the power of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, without any deliberation of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as when, without premeditation, he moves his hand, or foot. Therefore sometimes also the lower reason may consent to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, independently of the higher reason.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 12): "If the consent to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use of things that can be perceived by the bodily senses, so far approves of any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as to point, if possible, to its consummation by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, we are to understand that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has offered the forbidden fruit to her husband."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Consent implies a judgment about the thing to which consent is given. For just as the speculative reason judges and delivers its sentence about intelligible matters, so the practical reason judges and pronounces sentence on matters of action. Now we must observe that in every case brought up for judgment, the final sentence belongs to the supreme court, even as we see that in speculative matters the final sentence touching any proposition is delivered by referring it to the first principles; since, so long as there remains a yet higher principle, the question can yet be submitted to it: wherefore the judgment is still in suspense, the final sentence not being as yet pronounced. But it is evident that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> can be regulated by the rule of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which rule is derived from the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>; and further still, from the rule of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, as stated above (Question 19, Article 4). Consequently, since the rule of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> is the higher rule, it follows that the ultimate sentence, whereby the judgment is finally pronounced, belongs to the higher reason which is intent on the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types. Now when judgment has to be pronounced on several points, the final judgment deals with that which comes last; and, in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, the action itself comes last, and the delectation which is the inducement to the action is a preamble thereto. Therefore the consent to an action belongs properly to the higher reason, while the preliminary judgment which is about the delectation belongs to the lower reason, which delivers judgment in a lower court: although the higher reason can also judge of the delectation, since whatever is subject to the judgment of the lower court, is subject also to the judgment of the higher court, but not conversely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Consent is an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, not absolutely, but in consequence of an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> deliberating and judging, as stated above (Question 15, Article 3). Because the fact that the consent is finally given to a thing is due to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends to that upon which the reason has already passed its judgment. Hence consent may be ascribed both to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and to the reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The higher reason is said to consent, from the very fact that it fails to direct the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, whether or not it advert to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For if it thinks of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, it holds it in actual contempt: and if not, it neglects it by a kind of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>. Therefore the consent to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act always proceeds from the higher reason: because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 12), "the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> cannot effectively decide on the commission of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless by its consent, whereby it wields its sovereign power of moving the members to action, or of restraining them from action, it become the servant or <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The higher reason, by considering the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, can direct or restrain the internal delectation, even as it can direct or restrain the external action: nevertheless, before the judgment of the higher reason is pronounced the lower reason, while deliberating the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in reference to temporal principles, sometimes approves of this delectation: and then the consent to the delectation belongs to the lower reason. If, however, after considering the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> persists in giving the same consent, such consent will then belong to the higher reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The apprehension of the power of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is sudden and indeliberate: wherefore it can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> an act before the higher or lower reason has time to deliberate. But the judgment of the lower reason is deliberate, and so requires time, during which the higher reason can also deliberate; consequently, if by its deliberation it does not check the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, this will deservedly by imputed to it.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether consent to delectation is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that consent to delectation is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for consent to delectation belongs to the lower reason, which does not consider the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and consequently does not turn away from them. Now every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in turning away from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> definition of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which was quoted above (Question 71, Article 6). Therefore consent to delectation is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, consent to a thing is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, unless the thing to which consent is given be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now "the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of anything being such is yet more so," or at any rate not less. Consequently the thing to which a man consents cannot be a lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than his consent. But delectation without <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore neither is the consent to the delectation a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, delectations differ in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, according to the difference of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. x, 3,5). Now the inward thought is one thing, and the outward <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, e.g. fornication, is another. Therefore the delectation consequent to the act of inward thought, differs in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> from the pleasure of fornication, as much as the inward thought differs from the outward <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>; and consequently there is a like difference of consent on either hand. But the inward thought is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor is the consent to that thought: and therefore neither is the consent to the delectation.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the external act of fornication or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not by reason of the delectation, since this is found also in the marriage act, but by reason of an inordinateness in the act itself. Now he that consents to the delectation does not, for this reason, consent to the inordinateness of the act. Therefore he seems not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is more grievous than simple fornication. Now it is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to consent to the delectation resulting from the thought of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Much less therefore is it a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to consent to the delectation resulting from the thought of fornication.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a> is recited every day for the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> asserts (Enchiridion lxxviii). Now <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> teaches that consent to delectation may be driven away by means of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>: for he says (De Trin. xii, 12) that "this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is much less grievous than if it be decided to fulfil it by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>: wherefore we ought to ask pardon for such thoughts also, and we should strike our breasts and say: 'Forgive us our trespasses.'" Therefore consent to delectation is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> adds after a few words: "Man will be altogether lost unless, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Mediator, he be forgiven those things which are deemed mere <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of thought, since without the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to do them, he desires nevertheless to enjoy them." But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is lost except through mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore consent to delectation is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There have been various opinions on this point, for some have held that consent to delectation is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, while others have held it to be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and this opinion is more common and more probable. For we must take note that since every delectation results from some action, as stated in Ethic. x, 4, and again, that since every delectation may be compared to two things, viz. to the operation from which it results, and to the object in which a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> takes delight. Now it happens that an action, just as a thing, is an object of delectation, because the action itself can be considered as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and an end, in which the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who delights in it, rests. Sometimes the action itself, which results in delectation, is the object of delectation, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, to which it belongs to take delight in anything, is brought to bear on the action itself as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for instance, when a man thinks and delights in his thought, in so far as his thought pleases him; while at other times the delight consequent to an action, e.g. a thought, has for its object another action, as being the object of his thought; and then his thought proceeds from the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, not indeed to the thought, but to the action thought of. Accordingly a man who is thinking of fornication, may delight in either of two things: first, in the thought itself, secondly, in the fornication thought of. Now the delectation in the thought itself results from the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to the thought; and the thought itself is not in itself a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; sometimes indeed it is only a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as when a man thinks of such a thing for no purpose; and sometimes it is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all, as when a man has a purpose in thinking of it; for instance, he may wish to preach or dispute about it. Consequently such affection or delectation in respect of the thought of fornication is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in virtue of its genus, but is sometimes a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and sometimes no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all: wherefore neither is it a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to consent to such a thought. In this sense the first opinion is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p>But that a man in thinking of fornication takes pleasure in the act thought of, is due to his desire being inclined to this act. Wherefore the fact that a man consents to such a delectation, amounts to nothing less than a consent to the inclination of his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to fornication: for no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes pleasure except in that which is in conformity with his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if a man deliberately chooses that his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> be conformed to what is in itself a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore such a consent to delectation in a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is itself a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as the second opinion maintains.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Consent to delectation may be not only in the lower reason, but also in the higher reason, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). Nevertheless the lower reason may turn away from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types, for, though it is not intent on them, as regulating according to them, which is proper to the higher reason, yet, it is intent on them, as being regulated according to them: and by turning from them in this sense, it may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally; since even the acts of the lower powers and of the external members may be mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in so far as the direction of the higher reason fails in directing them according to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Consent to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is venial in its genus, is itself a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and accordingly one may conclude that the consent to take pleasure in a useless thought about fornication, is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But delectation in the act itself of fornication is, in its genus, a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and that it be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> before the consent is given, is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, viz. on account of the incompleteness of the act: which incompleteness ceases when the deliberate consent has been given, so that therefore it has its complete <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers the delectation which has the thought for its object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The delectation which has an external act for its object, cannot be without complacency in the external act as such, even though there be no decision to fulfil it, on account of the prohibition of some higher authority: wherefore the act is inordinate, and consequently the delectation will be inordinate also.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The consent to delectation, resulting from complacency in an act of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> thought of, is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also: but not the consent to delectation resulting from complacency in the thought of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> is to be said in order that we may be preserved not only from venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether there can be venial sin in the higher reason as directing the lower powers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there cannot be venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the higher reason as directing the lower powers, i.e. as consenting to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 7) that the "higher reason is intent on considering and consulting the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." But mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in turning away from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore it seems that there can be no other than mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the higher reason.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the higher reason is the principle of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, as the heart is of the body's life. But the diseases of the heart are deadly. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the higher reason are mortal.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> becomes a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if it be done out of contempt. But it would seem impossible to commit even a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, deliberately, without contempt. Since then the consent of the higher reason is always accompanied by deliberate consideration of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, it seems that it cannot be without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, on account of the contempt of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Consent to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act belongs to the higher reason, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). But consent to an act of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is itself a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be in the higher reason.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 7), the higher reason "is intent on contemplating or consulting the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>"; it contemplates it by considering its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; it consults it by judging and directing other things according to it: and to this pertains the fact that by deliberating through the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types, it consents to an act or dissents from it. Now it may happen that the inordinateness of the act to which it consents, is not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in the same way as mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is, because it does not imply aversion from the last end, but is beside that <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as an act of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is. Therefore when the higher reason consents to the act of a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it does not turn away from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: wherefore it <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, not mortally, but venially.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Disease of the heart is twofold: one which is in the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the heart, and affects its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> consistency, and such a disease is always mortal: the other is a disease of the heart consisting in some disorder either of the movement or of the parts surrounding the heart, and such a disease is not always mortal. In like manner there is mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the higher reason whenever the order itself of the higher reason to its proper object which is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, is destroyed; but when the disorder leaves this untouched, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not mortal but venial.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Deliberate consent to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not always amount to contempt of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, but only when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether venial sin can be in the higher reason as such?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be in the higher reason as such, i.e. as considering the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For the act of a power is not found to fail except that power be inordinately disposed with regard to its object. Now the object of the higher reason is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in respect of which there can be no disorder without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore there can be no venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the higher reason as such.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since the reason is a deliberative power, there can be no <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> without deliberation. Now every inordinate movement in things concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if it be deliberate, is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is never in the higher reason as such.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it happens sometimes that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which takes us unawares, is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now a deliberate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through the reason, in deliberating, having recourse to some higher <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by acting against which, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously; just as when the reason in deliberating about an inordinate pleasurable act, considers that it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously in consenting, than if it only considered that it is contrary to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But the higher reason cannot have recourse to any higher tribunal than its own object. Therefore if a movement that takes us unawares is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither will the subsequent deliberation make it a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore there can be no venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the higher reason as such.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A sudden movement of unbelief is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But it belongs to the higher reason as such. Therefore there can be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the higher reason as such.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The higher reason regards its own object otherwise than the objects of the lower powers that are directed by the higher reason. For it does not regard the objects of the lower powers, except in so far as it consults the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> about them, and so it does not regard them save by way of deliberation. Now deliberate consent to what is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in its genus, is itself a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and consequently the higher reason always <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally, if the acts of the lower powers to which it consents are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>With regard to its own object it has a twofold act, viz. simple "intuition," and "deliberation," in respect of which it again consults the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> about its own object. But in respect of simple intuition, it can have an inordinate movement about Divine things, as when a man suffers a sudden movement of unbelief. And although unbelief, in its genus, is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet a sudden movement of unbelief is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because there is no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unless it be contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now it is possible for one of the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> to present itself to the reason suddenly under some other aspect, before the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is consulted, or can be consulted, on the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; as, for instance, when a man suddenly apprehends the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> as impossible <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, and rejects it, as soon as he had thus apprehended it, before he has had time to deliberate and consider that this is proposed to our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. If, however, the movement of unbelief remains after this deliberation, it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore, in sudden movements, the higher reason may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially in respect of its proper object, even if it be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in its genus; or it may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally in giving a deliberate consent; but in things pertaining to the lower powers, it always <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally, in things which are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in their genus, but not in those which are venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in their genus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is against the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, though it be mortal in its genus, may nevertheless be venial, on account of the incompleteness of a sudden action, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In matters of action, the simple intuition of the principles from which deliberation proceeds, belongs to the reason, as well as the act of deliberation: even as in speculative matters it belongs to the reason both to syllogize and to form propositions: consequently the reason also can have a sudden movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One and the same thing may be the subject of different considerations, of which one is higher than the other; thus the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be considered, either as possible to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, or as delivered to us by Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, which is a higher consideration. And therefore, although the object of the higher reason is, in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, something sublime, yet it is reducible to some yet higher consideration: and in this way, that which in the sudden movement was not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, becomes a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in virtue of the deliberation which brought it into the light of a higher consideration, as was explained above.
