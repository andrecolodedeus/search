<h1>Question 75. Derision</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3075.htm#article1"> Is derision a special sin distinct from the other sins whereby one's neighbor is injured by words?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3075.htm#article2"> Is derision a mortal sin?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether derision is a special sin distinct from those already mentioned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that derision is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> distinct from those mentioned above. For laughing to scorn is apparently the same as derision. But laughing to scorn pertains to reviling. Therefore derision would seem not to differ from reviling.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is derided except for something reprehensible which puts him to shame. Now such are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and if they be imputed to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> publicly, it is a case of reviling, if privately, it amounts to backbiting or tale-bearing. Therefore derision is not distinct from the foregoing <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of this kind are distinguished by the injury they inflict on one's neighbor. Now the injury inflicted on a man by derision affects either his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, or his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, or is detrimental to his friendship. Therefore derision is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> distinct from the foregoing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Derision is done in jest, wherefore it is described as "making fun." Now all the foregoing are done seriously and not in jest. Therefore derision differs from all of them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 72, Article 2), <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of word should be weighed chiefly by the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the speaker, wherefore these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are differentiated according to the various intentions of those who speak against another. Now just as the railer intends to injure the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he rails, the backbiter to depreciate a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, and the tale-bearer to destroy friendship, so too the derider intends to shame the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he derides. And since this end is distinct from the others, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of derision is distinct from the foregoing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Laughing to scorn and derision agree as to the end but differ in mode, because derision is done with the "mouth," i.e. by words and laughter, while laughing to scorn is done by wrinkling the nose, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/psa002.htm#verse4">Psalm 2:4</a>, "He that dwelleth in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> shall laugh at them": and such a distinction does not differentiate the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Yet they both differ from reviling, as being shamed differs from being dishonored: for to be ashamed is "to fear dishonor," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> states (De Fide Orth. ii, 15).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> For doing a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> a man deserves both respect and a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name in the eyes of others, and in his own eyes the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse12">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>, "Our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is this, the testimony of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>." Hence, on the other hand, for doing a reprehensible, i.e. a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> action, a man forfeits his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name in the eyes of others--and for this purpose the reviler and the backbiter speak of another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>--while in his own eyes, he loses the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> through being confused and ashamed at reprehensible <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> being imputed to him--and for this purpose the derider speaks ill of him. It is accordingly evident that derision agrees with the foregoing <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> but differs as to the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A secure and calm <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is a great <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse15">Proverbs 15:15</a>, "A secure mind is like a continual feast." Wherefore he that disturbs another's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> by confounding him inflicts a special injury on him: hence derision is a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether derision can be a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that derision cannot be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But derision does not seem contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, for sometimes it takes place in jest among friends, wherefore it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as "making fun." Therefore derision cannot be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the greatest derision would appear to be that which is done as an injury to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But derision is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when it tends to the injury of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: else it would be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to relapse into a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which one has repented. For <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Sum. Bon. ii, 16) that "he who continues to do what he has repented of, is a derider and not a penitent." It would likewise follow that all hypocrisy is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 15) "the ostrich signifies the hypocrite, who derides the horse, i.e. the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and his rider, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore derision is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, reviling and backbiting seem to be graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> than derision, because it is more to do a thing seriously than in jest. But not all backbiting or reviling is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Much less therefore is derision a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse34">Proverbs 3:34</a>): "He derideth [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'shall scorn'] the scorners." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> derision is <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as appears from the words of <a href="../bible/psa002.htm#verse4">Psalm 2:4</a>, "He that dwelleth in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> shall laugh at them." Therefore derision is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The object of derision is always some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or defect. Now when an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is great, it is taken, not in jest, but seriously: consequently if it is taken in jest or turned to ridicule (whence the terms 'derision' and 'jesting'), this is because it is considered to be slight. Now an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may be considered to be slight in two ways: first, in itself, secondly, in relation to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. When anyone makes game or fun of another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or defect, because it is a slight <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, this is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by reason of its genus. on the other hand this defect may be considered as a slight <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in relation to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, just as we are wont to think little of the defects of children and imbeciles: and then to make game or fun of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, is to scorn him altogether, and to think him so despicable that his misfortune troubles us not one whit, but is held as an object of derision. On this way derision is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and more grievous than reviling, which is also done openly: because the reviler would seem to take another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> seriously; whereas the derider does so in fun, and so would seem the more to despise and dishonor the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore, in this sense, derision is a grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and all the more grievous according as a greater respect is due to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> derided.

<p>Consequently it is an exceedingly grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to deride <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa037.htm#verse23">Isaiah 37:23</a>, "Whom hast thou reproached, and whom hast thou blasphemed, and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice?" and he replies: "Against the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." On the second place comes derision of one's parents, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse17">Proverbs 30:17</a>): "The eye that mocketh at his father, and that despiseth the labor of his mother in bearing him, let the ravens of the brooks pick it out, and the young eagles eat it." Further, the derision of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is grievous, because <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and against this it is written (<a href="../bible/job012.htm#verse4">Job 12:4</a>): "The simplicity of the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is laughed to scorn." Such like derision does very much harm: because it turns men away from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xx, 14), "Who when they perceive any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> points appearing in the acts of others, directly pluck them up with the hand of a mischievous reviling."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Jesting implies nothing contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in relation to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with whom one jests, but it may imply something against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in relation to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is the object of the jest, on account of contempt, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Neither he that relapses into a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which he has repented, nor a hypocrite, derides <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> explicitly, but implicitly, in so far as either's behavior is like a derider's. Nor is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that to commit a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to relapse or dissimulate altogether, but only dispositively and imperfectly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Derision considered in itself is less grievous than backbiting or reviling, because it does not imply contempt, but jest. Sometimes however it includes greater contempt than reviling does, as stated above, and then it is a grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.
