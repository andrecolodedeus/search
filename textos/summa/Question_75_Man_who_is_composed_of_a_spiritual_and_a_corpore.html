<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the soul is a body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a body. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the moving principle of the body. Nor does it move unless moved.

<p>First, because seemingly nothing can move unless it is itself moved, since nothing gives what it has not; for instance, what is not hot does not give heat.

<p>Secondly, because if there be anything that moves and is not moved, it must be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, unchanging movement, as we find <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> Phys. viii, 6; and this does not appear to be the case in the movement of an animal, which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a mover moved. But every mover moved is a body. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by means of a likeness. But there can be no likeness of a body to an incorporeal thing. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were not a body, it could not have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of corporeal things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, between the mover and the moved there must be contact. But contact is only between bodies. Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> moves the body, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must be a body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 6) that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> "is simple in comparison with the body, inasmuch as it does not occupy space by its bulk."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To seek the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, we must premise that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is defined as the first principle of life of those things which live: for we call living things "animate," [i.e. having a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>], and those things which have no life, "inanimate." Now life is shown principally by two actions, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and movement. The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of old, not being able to rise above their <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, supposed that the principle of these actions was something corporeal: for they asserted that only bodies were real things; and that what is not corporeal is nothing: hence they maintained that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is something corporeal. This opinion can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in many ways; but we shall make use of only one <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, based on universal and certain principles, which shows clearly that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not a body.

<p>It is manifest that not every principle of vital action is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for then the eye would be a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as it is a principle of vision; and the same might be applied to the other instruments of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: but it is the "first" principle of life, which we call the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now, though a body may be a principle of life, or to be a living thing, as the heart is a principle of life in an animal, yet nothing corporeal can be the first principle of life. For it is clear that to be a principle of life, or to be a living thing, does not belong to a body as such; since, if that were the case, every body would be a living thing, or a principle of life. Therefore a body is competent to be a living thing or even a principle of life, as "such" a body. Now that it is actually such a body, it owes to some principle which is called its act. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the first principle of life, is not a body, but the act of a body; thus heat, which is the principle of calefaction, is not a body, but an act of a body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As everything which is in motion must be moved by something else, a process which cannot be prolonged indefinitely, we must allow that not every mover is moved. For, since to be moved is to pass from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, the mover gives what it has to the thing moved, inasmuch as it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> it to be in act. But, as is shown in Phys. viii, 6, there is a mover which is altogether immovable, and not moved either <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; and such a mover can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> an invariable movement. There is, however, another kind of mover, which, though not moved <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, is moved <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; and for this reason it does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> an invariable movement; such a mover, is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. There is, again, another mover, which is moved <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>--namely, the body. And because the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of old <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that nothing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> but bodies, they maintained that every mover is moved; and that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is moved directly, and is a body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The likeness of a thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> actually in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the knower; but given a thing which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>, and afterwards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> actually, the likeness of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> must be in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the knower, not actually, but only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>; thus color is not actually in the pupil of the eye, but only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, not that the likeness of corporeal things should be actually in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but that there be a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for such a likeness. But the ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> omitted to distinguish between <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; and so they held that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must be a body in order to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a body; and that it must be composed of the principles of which all bodies are formed in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all bodies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There are two kinds of contact; of "<a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>," and of "power." By the former a body can be touched only by a body; by the latter a body can be touched by an incorporeal thing, which moves that body.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the human soul is something subsistent?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not something subsistent. For that which subsists is said to be "this particular thing." Now "this particular thing" is said not of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but of that which is composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not something subsistent.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, everything subsistent operates. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not operate; for, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima i, 4), "to say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> feels or understands is like saying that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> weaves or builds." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not subsistent.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were subsistent, it would have some operation apart from the body. But it has no operation apart from the body, not even that of understanding: for the act of understanding does not take place without a phantasm, which cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> apart from the body. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not something subsistent.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 7): "Who understands that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is that of a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and not that of a body, will see that those who maintain the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, are led astray through associating with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> those things without which they are unable to think of any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>--i.e. <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> pictures of corporeal things." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not only incorporeal, but it is also a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, that is, something subsistent.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be allowed that the principle of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation which we call the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is a principle both incorporeal and subsistent. For it is clear that by means of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all corporeal things. Now whatever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> certain things cannot have any of them in its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; because that which is in it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> would impede the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of anything else. Thus we observe that a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> tongue being vitiated by a feverish and bitter humor, is insensible to anything sweet, and everything seems bitter to it. Therefore, if the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle contained the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a body it would be unable to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all bodies. Now every body has its own determinate <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it is impossible for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle to be a body. It is likewise impossible for it to understand by means of a bodily organ; since the determinate <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that organ would impede <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all bodies; as when a certain determinate color is not only in the pupil of the eye, but also in a glass vase, the liquid in the vase seems to be of that same color.

<p>Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle which we call the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> or the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has an operation "per se" apart from the body. Now only that which subsists can have an operation "per se." For nothing can operate but what is actual: for which reason we do not say that heat imparts heat, but that what is hot gives heat. We must conclude, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is called the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, is something incorporeal and subsistent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "This particular thing" can be taken in two senses.

<p>Firstly, for anything subsistent; secondly, for that which subsists, and is complete in a specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. The former sense excludes the inherence of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> or of a material form; the latter excludes also the imperfection of the part, so that a hand can be called "this particular thing" in the first sense, but not in the second. Therefore, as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it can indeed be called "this particular thing," in the first sense, as being something subsistent; but not in the second, for in this sense, what is composed of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is said to be "this particular thing."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> wrote those words as expressing not his own opinion, but the opinion of those who said that to understand is to be moved, as is clear from the context. Or we may reply that to operate "per se" belongs to what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> "per se." But for a thing to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> "per se," it suffices sometimes that it be not inherent, as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> or a material form; even though it be part of something. Nevertheless, that is rightly said to subsist "per se," which is neither inherent in the above sense, nor part of anything else. In this sense, the eye or the hand cannot be said to subsist "per se"; nor can it for that reason be said to operate "per se." Hence the operation of the parts is through each part attributed to the whole. For we say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sees with the eye, and feels with the hand, and not in the same sense as when we say that what is hot gives heat by its heat; for heat, strictly speaking, does not give heat. We may therefore say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands, as the eye sees; but it is more correct to say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> understands through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The body is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, not as its origin of action, but on the part of the object; for the phantasm is to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> what color is to the sight. Neither does such a dependence on the body <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to be non-subsistent; otherwise it would follow that an animal is non-subsistent, since it requires external objects of the senses in order to perform its act of perception.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the souls of brute animals are subsistent?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of brute animals are subsistent. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is of the same 'genus' as other animals; and, as we have just shown (2), the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is subsistent. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of other animals are subsistent.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the relation of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a> to sensible objects is like the relation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a> to intelligible objects. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, apart from the body, apprehends intelligible objects. Therefore the sensitive <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a>, apart from the body, perceives sensible objects. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of brute animals are sensitive, it follows that they are subsistent; just as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is subsistent.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of brute animals moves the body. But the body is not a mover, but is moved. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of brute animals has an operation apart from the body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Is what is written in the book De Eccl. Dogm. xvi, xvii: "Man alone we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to have a subsistent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: whereas the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of animals are not subsistent."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> made no distinction between sense and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and referred both a corporeal principle, as has been said (1). <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, however, drew a distinction between <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and sense; yet he referred both to an incorporeal principle, maintaining that sensing, just as understanding, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as such. From this it follows that even the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of brute animals are subsistent. But <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> held that of the operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, understanding alone is performed without a corporeal organ. On the other hand, sensation and the consequent operations of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are evidently accompanied with change in the body; thus in the act of vision, the pupil of the eye is affected by a reflection of color: and so with the other senses. Hence it is clear that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has no "per se" operation of its own, and that every operation of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> belongs to the composite. Wherefore we conclude that as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of brute animals have no "per se" operations they are not subsistent. For the operation of anything follows the mode of its being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is of the same "genus" as other animals, he is of a different "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>." Specific difference is derived from the difference of form; nor does every difference of form <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> imply a diversity of "genus."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The relation of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a> to the sensible object is in one way the same as that of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a> to the intelligible object, in so far as each is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to its object. But in another way their relations differ, inasmuch as the impression of the object on the sense is accompanied with change in the body; so that excessive strength of the sensible corrupts sense; a thing that never occurs in the case of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> that understands the highest of intelligible objects is more able afterwards to understand those that are lower. If, however, in the process of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation the body is weary, this result is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> requires the operation of the sensitive powers in the production of the phantasms.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Motive power is of two kinds. One, the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, commands motion. The operation of this power in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not apart from the body; for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of a like <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are accompanied by a change in the body. The other motive power is that which executes motion in adapting the members for obeying the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; and the act of this power does not consist in moving, but in being moved. Whence it is clear that to move is not an act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without the body.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the soul is man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse16">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>): "Though our outward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is corrupted, yet the inward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is renewed day by day." But that which is within <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the inward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. But it is not a universal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore it is a particular <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore it is a "hypostasis" or a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and it can only be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is a man.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xix, 3) commends Varro as holding "that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not a mere <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nor a mere body; but both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The assertion "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," can be taken in two senses.

<p>First, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; though this particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, for instance, is not a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. I say this, forasmuch as some held that the form alone belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; while <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is part of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and not the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. This cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> belongs what the definition signifies; and in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things the definition does not signify the form only, but the form and the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is part of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; not, indeed, signate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a>; but the common <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For as it belongs to the notion of this particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be composed of this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, of this flesh, and of these bones; so it belongs to the notion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, flesh, and bones; for whatever belongs in common to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> contained under a given <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, must belong to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>It may also be understood in this sense, that this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and this could be held if it were supposed that the operation of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were proper to it, apart from the body; because in that case all the operations which are attributed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> only; and whatever performs the operations proper to a thing, is that thing; wherefore that which performs the operations of a man is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But it has been shown above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>) that sensation is not the operation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> only. Since, then, sensation is an operation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but not proper to him, it is clear that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> only, but something composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, through supposing that sensation was proper to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, could maintain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> making use of the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ix, 8), a thing seems to be chiefly what is principle in it; thus what the governor of a state does, the state is said to do. In this way sometimes what is principle in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; sometimes, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part which, in accordance with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is called the "inward" <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and sometimes the sensitive part with the body is called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the opinion of those whose observation does not go beyond the senses. And this is called the "outward" <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not every particular <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is a hypostasis or a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but that which has the complete <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Hence a hand, or a foot, is not called a hypostasis, or a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; nor, likewise, is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone so called, since it is a part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the soul is composed of matter and form?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>. Now, whatsoever things are in <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> participate of the First Act, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; by participation of Whom, all things are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, are beings, and are living things, as is clear from the teaching of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. v). Therefore whatsoever things are in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> participate of the first <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. But the first <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is, after a manner, in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; which appears from the fact that sometimes a man is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> understanding; it seems that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must participate of primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as part of itself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, wherever the properties of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are found, there <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is. But the properties of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are found in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--namely, to be a subject, and to be changed, for it is a subject to science, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and it changes from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things which have no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, have no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 6). But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, since it is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, what has no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and is a form only, is a <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. But this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. vii, 7,8,9) proves that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was made neither of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, nor of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. We may consider this question in two ways.

<p>First, from the notion of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in general; for it belongs to the notion of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be the form of a body. Now, either it is a form by virtue of itself, in its entirety, or by virtue of some part of itself. If by virtue of itself in its entirety, then it is impossible that any part of it should be <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, if by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> we understand something purely <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a>: for a form, as such, is an act; and that which is purely <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> cannot be part of an act, since <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is repugnant to <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> as being opposite thereto. If, however, it be a form by virtue of a part of itself, then we call that part the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which it actualizes first, we call the "primary animate."

<p>Secondly, we may proceed from the specific notion of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> inasmuch as it is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. For it is clear that whatever is received into something is received according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the recipient. Now a thing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in as far as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is in the knower. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a thing in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> absolutely: for instance, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a stone absolutely as a stone; and therefore the form of a stone absolutely, as to its proper formal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself is an absolute form, and not something composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. For if the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, the forms of things would be received into it as <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and so it would only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>: just as it happens with the sensitive powers which receive forms in a corporeal organ; since <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the principle by which forms are individualized. It follows, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> which has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of forms absolutely, is exempt from composition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The First Act is the universal principle of all acts; because It is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, virtually "precontaining all things," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. v). Wherefore things participate of It not as a part of themselves, but by diffusion of Its processions. Now as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is receptive of act, it must be proportionate to act. But the acts received which proceed from the First <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">Infinite</a> Act, and are participations thereof, are diverse, so that there cannot be one <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> which receives all acts, as there is one act, from which all participated acts are derived; for then the receptive <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> would equal the active <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the First Act. Now the receptive <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is other than the receptive <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of first <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as appears from the diversity of the things received by each. For primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> receives <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> forms; whereas the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> receives absolute forms. Hence the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of such a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To be a subject and to be changed belong to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by reason of its being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. As, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is one thing and the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> another, so in each is there a different reason of subjection and change. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and is changed from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, by reason of its being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> with regard to the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The form <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to be, and so does the agent; wherefore the agent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to be, so far as it actualizes it by transmuting it to the act of a form. A subsistent form, however, does not owe its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to some formal principle, nor has it a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> transmuting it from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act. So after the words quoted above, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> concludes, that in things composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> "there is no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> but that which moves from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act; while whatsoever things have no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are simply beings at once." [The Leonine edition has, "simpliciter sunt quod vere entia aliquid." The Parma edition of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas's</a> Commentary on Aristotle has, "statim per se unum quiddam est . . . et ens quiddam."]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Everything participated is compared to the participator as its act. But whatever <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> form be supposed to subsist "per se," must have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by participation; for "even life," or anything of that sort, "is a participator of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. v). Now participated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is limited by the capacity of the participator; so that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, Who is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a> and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> there is composition of <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, not, indeed, of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but of form and participated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Wherefore some say that they are composed of that "whereby they are" and that "which they are"; for <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> itself is that by which a thing is.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the human soul is incorruptible?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is corruptible. For those things that have a like beginning and process seemingly have a like end. But the beginning, by generation, of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is like that of animals, for they are made from the earth. And the process of life is alike in both; because "all things breathe alike, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath nothing more than the beast," as it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc003.htm#verse19">Ecclesiastes 3:19</a>). Therefore, as the same text concludes, "the death of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and beast is one, and the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of both is equal." But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of brute animals are corruptible. Therefore, also, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is corruptible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is out of nothing can return to nothingness; because the end should correspond to the beginning. But as it is written (<a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse2">Wisdom 2:2</a>), "We are born of nothing"; which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, not only of the body, but also of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore, as is concluded in the same passage, "After this we shall be as if we had not been," even as to our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing is without its own proper operation. But the operation proper to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is to understand through a phantasm, cannot be without the body. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands nothing without a phantasm; and there is no phantasm without the body as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima i, 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot survive the dissolution of the body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> owe to Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> that they are "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>," and that they have "an incorruptible <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> life."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must assert that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle which we call the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is incorruptible. For a thing may be corrupted in two ways--"per se," and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Now it is impossible for any <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> to be generated or corrupted <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, that is, by the generation or corruption of something else. For generation and corruption belong to a thing, just as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> belongs to it, which is acquired by generation and lost by corruption. Therefore, whatever has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> "per se" cannot be generated or corrupted except 'per se'; while things which do not subsist, such as <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> and material forms, acquire <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> or lost it through the generation or corruption of composite things. Now it was shown above (2,3) that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of brutes are not self-subsistent, whereas the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is; so that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of brutes are corrupted, when their bodies are corrupted; while the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could not be corrupted unless it were corrupted "per se." This, indeed, is impossible, not only as regards the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but also as regards anything subsistent that is a form alone. For it is clear that what belongs to a thing by virtue of itself is inseparable from it; but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> belongs to a form, which is an act, by virtue of itself. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> acquires actual <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as it acquires the form; while it is corrupted so far as the form is separated from it. But it is impossible for a form to be separated from itself; and therefore it is impossible for a subsistent form to cease to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p>Granted even that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, as some pretend, we should nevertheless have to maintain that it is incorruptible. For corruption is found only where there is contrariety; since generation and corruption are from contraries and into contraries. Wherefore the heavenly bodies, since they have no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> subject to contrariety, are incorruptible. Now there can be no contrariety in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for it receives according to the manner of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and those things which it receives are without contrariety; for the notions even of contraries are not themselves contrary, since contraries belong to the same <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore it is impossible for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be corruptible. Moreover we may take a sign of this from the fact that everything <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> aspires to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> after its own manner. Now, in things that have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, desire ensues upon <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The senses indeed do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, except under the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of "here" and "now," whereas the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> apprehends <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> absolutely, and for all time; so that everything that has an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires always to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire cannot be in vain. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is incorruptible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Solomon reasons thus in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the foolish, as expressed in the words of <a href="../bible/wis002.htm">Wisdom 2</a>. Therefore the saying that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and animals have a like beginning in generation is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the body; for all animals alike are made of earth. But it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of brutes are produced by some power of the body; whereas the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To signify this it is written as to other animals: "Let the earth bring forth the living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse24">Genesis 1:24</a>): while of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> it is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse7">Genesis 2:7</a>) that "He breathed into his face the breath of life." And so in <a href="../bible/ecc012.htm#verse7">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a> it is concluded: "(Before) the dust return into its earth from whence it was; and the spirit return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who gave it." Again the process of life is alike as to the body, concerning which it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc003.htm#verse19">Ecclesiastes 3:19</a>): "All things breathe alike," and (<a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse2">Wisdom 2:2</a>), "The breath in our nostrils is smoke." But the process is not alike of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a>, whereas animals are not. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> to say: "Man has nothing more than beasts." Thus death comes to both alike as to the body, by not as to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As a thing can be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by reason, not of a passive <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, but only of the active <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>, Who can produce something out of nothing, so when we say that a thing can be reduced to nothing, we do not imply in the creature a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to non-existence, but in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> the power of ceasing to sustain <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But a thing is said to be corruptible because there is in it a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to non-existence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To understand through a phantasm is the proper operation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by virtue of its union with the body. After separation from the body it will have another mode of understanding, similar to other <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> separated from bodies, as will appear later on (89, 1).

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the soul is of the same species as an angel?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. For each thing is ordained to its proper end by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, whence is derived its inclination for that end. But the end of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the same as that of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>--namely, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Therefore they are of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the ultimate specific difference is the noblest, because it completes the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But there is nothing nobler either in an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> agree in the ultimate specific difference: therefore they belong to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not differ from an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> except in its union with the body. But as the body is outside the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it seems that it does not belong to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> are of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Things which have different <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> operations are of different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> are different; since, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii), "Angelic minds have simple and blessed <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, not gathering their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things from visible things." Subsequently he says the contrary to this of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> are not of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Peri Archon iii, 5) held that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are all of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and this because he supposed that in these <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> the difference of degree was <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, as resulting from their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>: as we have seen above (Question 47, Article 2). But this cannot be; for in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">incorporeal substances</a> there cannot be diversity of number without diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and inequality of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; because, as they are not composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but are subsistent forms, it is clear that there is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> among them a diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For a separate form cannot be understood otherwise than as one of a single <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; thus, supposing a separate whiteness to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, it could only be one; forasmuch as one whiteness does not differ from another except as in this or that subject. But diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is always accompanied with a diversity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thus in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of colors one is more perfect than another; and the same applies to other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, because differences which divide a "genus" are contrary to one another. Contraries, however, are compared to one another as the perfect to the imperfect, since the "principle of contrariety is <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and privation thereof," as is written Metaph. x (Did. ix, 4). The same would follow if the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> were composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. For if the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of one be distinct from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of another, it follows that either the form is the principle of the distinction of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>--that is to say, that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is distinct on account of its relation to divers forms; and even then there would result a difference of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and inequality of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: or else the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the principle of the distinction of forms. But one <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> cannot be distinct from another, except by a distinction of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, which has no place in these <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">incorporeal substances</a>, such as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. So that it is not possible for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. How it is that there can be many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> will be explained later (76, 2, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument proceeds from the proximate and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> end. <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the ultimate and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The ultimate specific difference is the noblest because it is the most determinate, in the same way as <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> is nobler than <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Thus, however, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a> is not the noblest, because it is indeterminate and common to many degrees of intellectuality; as the sensible <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a> is common to many degrees in the sensible <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, as all sensible things are not of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, so neither are all <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> things of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The body is not of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> can be united to the body, so that, properly speaking, not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, but the "composite," is the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. And the very fact that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in a certain way requires the body for its operation, proves that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is endowed with a grade of intellectuality inferior to that of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who is not united to a body.
