<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether sin has a cause?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated above (Question 71, Article 6). But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is that from which something follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Now that which is of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, seems to be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. It is not a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> produces nothing but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for "a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tree cannot bring forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit" (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse18">Matthew 7:18</a>). Likewise neither can <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment is a sequel to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of guilt is the same as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever is done has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for, according to <a href="../bible/job005.htm#verse6">Job 5:6</a>, "nothing upon earth is done without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>." But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is something done; since it a "word, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, or desire contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an inordinate act. Accordingly, so far as it is an act, it can have a direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, even as any other act; but, so far as it is inordinate, it has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in the same way as a negation or privation can have a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> may be assigned to a negation: in the first place, absence of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of affirmation; i.e. the negation of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> itself, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the negation in itself; since the result of the removing the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the removal of the effect: thus the absence of the sun is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of darkness. In the second place, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of an affirmation, of which a negation is a sequel, is the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the resulting negation: thus fire by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> heat in virtue of its principal tendency, consequently <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a privation of cold. The first of these suffices to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a simple negation. But, since the inordinateness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not a simple negation, but the privation of that which something ought <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to have, such an inordinateness must needs have an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For that which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> is and ought to be in a thing, is never lacking except on account of some impeding <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And accordingly we are wont to say that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which consists in a certain privation, has a deficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now every <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is reducible to the direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Since then <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, on the part of its inordinateness, has an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and on the part of the act, a direct efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it follows that the inordinateness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a result of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the act. Accordingly then, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> lacking the direction of the rule of reason and of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, and intent on some mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> directly, and the inordinateness of the act, indirectly, and beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>: for the lack of order in the act results from the lack of direction in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sin signifies not only the privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which privation is its inordinateness, but also the act which is the subject of that privation, which has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and how this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, has been explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If this definition is to be verified in all cases, it must be understood as applying to a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which is sufficient and not impeded. For it happens that a thing is the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of something else, and that the effect does not follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, on account of some supervening impediment: else it would follow that all things happen of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Metaph. vi, text. 5. Accordingly, though <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it does not follow that this is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, since its effect can be impeded.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in failing to apply the rule of reason or of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the fact of not applying the rule of reason or of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, has not in itself the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whether of punishment or of guilt, before it is applied to the act. Wherefore accordingly, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> lacking some other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether sin has an internal cause?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has no internal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For that which is within a thing is always in it. If therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had an internal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would always be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, since given the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the effect follows.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing is not its own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But the internal movements of a man are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore they are not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever is within <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is either <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Now that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> states (De Fide Orth. ii, 3; iv, 21); while that which is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, if it be inordinate, is already a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore nothing intrinsic can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Duabus Anim. x, 10,11; Retract. i, 9) that "the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> must be considered on the part of the act. Now we may distinguish a twofold internal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, one remote, the other proximate. The proximate internal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> is the reason and will, in respect of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; while the remote <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the apprehension of the sensitive part, and also the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. For just as it is due to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved to something in accord with reason, so it is due to an apprehension of the senses that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is inclined to something; which inclination sometimes influences the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and reason, as we shall explain further on (77, 1). Accordingly a double interior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be assigned; one proximate, on the part of the reason and will; and the other remote, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> or sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p>But since we have said above (1, ad 3) that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is some apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as motive, yet lacking the due motive, viz. the rule of reason or the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, this motive which is an apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, appertains to the apprehension of the senses and to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; while the lack of the due rule appertains to the reason, whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it is to consider this rule; and the completeness of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act appertains to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, so that the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, given the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> we have just mentioned, is already a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That which is within a thing as its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, is always in it: but that which is within it, as the internal act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> or apprehensive power, is not always in it. Now the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is made actual by the preceding movements, both of the sensitive part, in the first place, and afterwards, of the reason. For it is because a thing is proposed as appetible to the senses, and because the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is inclined, that the reason sometimes fails to consider the due rule, so that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> produces the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Since therefore the movements that precede it are not always actual, neither is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> always actually <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that all the internal acts belong to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for this consists principally in the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; but some precede and some follow the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as a power produces its act, is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>; and again, the movement of the sensitive part, from which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> follows, is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sometimes, as, for instance, when anyone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for food. Yet <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> results in being unnatural from the very fact that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> rule fails, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in accord with his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, ought to observe.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether sin has an external cause?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has no external <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act. Now <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acts belong to principles that are within us, so that they have no external <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has no external <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is an internal principle, so is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be due to no other than an internal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; for instance, the birth of a monster is due to the corruption of some internal principle. Therefore in the moral order, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can arise from no other than an internal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore it has no external <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is multiplied, the effect is multiplied. Now the more numerous and weighty the external inducements to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are, the less is a man's inordinate act imputed to him as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore nothing external is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/num021.htm#verse16">Numbers 21:16</a>): "Are not these they, that deceived the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by the counsel of Balaam, and made you transgress against the Lord by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Phogor?" Therefore something external can be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the internal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is both the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as completing the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, and the reason, as lacking the due rule, and the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as inclining to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Accordingly something external might be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in three ways, either by moving the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> itself immediately, or by moving the reason, or by moving the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now, as stated above (9, 6; 10, 4), none can move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> inwardly save <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, who cannot be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as we shall <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> further on (79, 1). Hence it follows that nothing external can be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except by moving the reason, as a man or <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by enticing to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; or by moving the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as certain external sensibles move it. Yet neither does external enticement move the reason, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, in matters of action, nor do things proposed externally, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> move the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, except perhaps it be disposed thereto in a certain way; and even the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> does not, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, move the reason and will. Therefore something external can be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> moving to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but not so as to be a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof: and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> alone is the sufficient completive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being accomplished.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> From the very fact that the external motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> do not lead to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> sufficiently and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, it follows that it remains in our power to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The fact that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has an internal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> does not prevent its having an external <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; for nothing external is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except through the medium of the internal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the external <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> inclining to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be multiplied, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> acts are multiplied, because they incline to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act in both greater numbers and greater frequency. Nevertheless the character of guilt is lessened, since this depends on the act being <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and in our power.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether one sin is a cause of another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another. For there are four kinds of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, none of which will fit in with one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> another. Because the end has the character of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; which is inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which has the character of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In like manner neither can a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, since "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but is weak and powerless," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Div. Nom. iv). The material and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> seems to have no place except in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies, which are composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot have either a material or a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "to produce its like belongs to a perfect thing," as stated in Meteor. iv, 2 [Cf. De Anima ii.]. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> something imperfect. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a second <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in the same way, yet another <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the first, and thus we go on indefinitely, which is absurd. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says on <a href="../cathen/05737b.htm">Ezechiel</a> (Hom. xi): "A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not quickly blotted out by repentance, is both a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Forasmuch as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on the part of the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is possible for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another, in the same way as one <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another. Hence it happens that one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another in respect of the four kinds of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. First, after the manner of an efficient or moving <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, both directly and indirectly. Indirectly, as that which removes an impediment is called an indirect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of movement: for when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, loses <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, or shame, or anything else that withdraws him from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he thereby falls into another <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the second. Directly, as when, by one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is disposed to commit more readily another like act: because acts <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> dispositions and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> inclining to like acts. Secondly, after the manner of a material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another, by preparing its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: thus <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> prepares the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for strife, which is often about the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> a man has amassed together. Thirdly, after the manner of a final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> another, in so far as a man commits one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for the sake of another which is his end; as when a man is guilty of simony for the end of ambition, or fornication for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>. And since the end gives the form to moral matters, as stated above (1, 3; 18, A4,6), it follows that one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is also the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another: because in the act of fornication committed for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, the former is material while the latter is formal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sin, in so far as it is inordinate, has the character of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but, in so far as it is an act, it has some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, at least apparent, for its end: so that, as an act, but not as being inordinate, it can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, both final and efficient, of another <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, not "of which" but "about which" it is: and it has its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> from its end. Consequently one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another, in respect of the four kinds of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sin is something imperfect on account of its moral imperfection on the part of its inordinateness. Nevertheless, as an act it can have <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection: and thus it can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is another <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; so there is no need to go on indefinitely: for one may come to one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by another <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.
