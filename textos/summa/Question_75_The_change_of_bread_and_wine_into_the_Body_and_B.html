<h1>Question 75. The change of bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ</h1>

<ol> <li><a href="../summa/4075.htm#article1"> Is the Body of Christ in this sacrament truly, or figuratively?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4075.htm#article2"> Do the substance of bread and wine remain in this sacrament after the consecration?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4075.htm#article3"> Is it annihilated?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4075.htm#article4"> Is it changed into the body and blood of Christ?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4075.htm#article5"> Do the accidents remain after the change?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4075.htm#article6"> Does the substantial form remain there?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4075.htm#article7"> Is this change instantaneous?</a> <!--see note below <li><a href="../summa/4075.htm#article7"> Is it more miraculous than any other change?</a>--> <li><a href="../summa/4075.htm#article8"> By what words it may be suitably expressed?</a> </ol>

<p><em>Editor's note:</em> The order of questions given here may vary from one edition of the Summa to the next. Originally, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> presented the questions in the following order, taken directly from his Commentary on the Sentences (iv. <em>Dist.</em> xc): <blockquote> "We have now to consider the change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ; under which head there are eight points of inquiry: (1) Whether the substance of bread and wine remain in this sacrament after the consecration? (2) Whether it is annihilated? (3) Whether it is changed into the body and blood of Christ? (4) Whether the accidents remain after the change? (5) Whether the substantial form remains there? (6) Whether this change is instantaneous? (7) Whether it is more miraculous than any other change? (8) By what words it may be suitably expressed?"</blockquote>

<p>However, in writing the articles themselves, he introduced a new arrangement, eliminating Article 7 ("Whether it is more <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> than any other change?"), adding a new article to the beginning ("Whether the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or merely as in a figure or sign?"), and renumbering the other articles accordingly.

<p>Most editions -- including this one -- have ignored <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas's</a> original division, and give the one to which he subsequently adhered.

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the body of Christ be in this sacrament in very truth, or merely as in a figure or sign?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but only as in a figure, or sign. For it is written (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse54">John 6:54</a>) that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> had uttered these words: "Except you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and drink His blood," etc., "Many of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> on hearing it said: 'this is a hard saying'": to whom He rejoined: "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing": as if He were to say, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> exposition on Ps. 4 [On Psalm 98:9]: "Give a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> meaning to what I have said. You are not to eat this body which you see, nor to drink the blood which they who crucify Me are to spill. It is a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> that I put before you: in its <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense it will quicken you; but the flesh profiteth nothing."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew 28:20</a>): "Behold I am with you all days even to the consummation of the world." Now in explaining this, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> makes this observation (Tract. xxx in Joan.): "The Lord is on high until the world be ended; nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Lord is here with us; for the body, in which He rose again, must be in one place; but His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is spread abroad everywhere." Therefore, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but only as in a sign.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no body can be in several places at the one time. For this does not even belong to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; since for the same reason it could be everywhere. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body, and it is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Consequently, it seems that it is not in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the sacrament of the altar, but only as in a sign.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are ordained for the profit of the faithful. But according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> in a certain Homily (xxviii in Evang.), the ruler is rebuked "for demanding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> bodily presence." Moreover the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were prevented from receiving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> because they were attached to His bodily presence, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse7">John 16:7</a>: "Except I go, the Paraclete will not come to you" (Tract. xciv in Joan.). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not in the sacrament of the altar according to His bodily presence.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. viii): "There is no room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and blood; for now by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> own declaring and by our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> His flesh is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> food, and His blood is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> drink." And <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. vi): "As the Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son so is it <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh which we take, and His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> blood which we drink."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The presence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body and blood in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> cannot be detected by sense, nor understanding, but by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, which rests upon Divine authority. Hence, on <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse19">Luke 22:19</a>: "This is My body which shall be delivered up for you," Cyril says: "<a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">Doubt</a> not whether this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but take rather the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour's</a> words with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for since He is the Truth, He lieth not."

<p>Now this is suitable, first for the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. For, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> contained only in figure that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse1">Hebrews 10:1</a>: "For the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> having a shadow of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come, not the very image of the things." And therefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the New Law</a> instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have something more, namely, that it should contain <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself crucified, not merely in signification or figure, but also in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> which contains <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii), is perfective of all the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is participated.

<p>Secondly, this belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> love, out of which for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> He assumed a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And because it is the special feature of friendship to live together with friends, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix), He promises us His bodily presence as a reward, saying (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse28">Matthew 24:28</a>): "Where the body is, there shall the eagles be gathered together." Yet meanwhile in our pilgrimage He does not deprive us of His bodily presence; but unites us with Himself in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> through the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His body and blood. Hence (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse57">John 6:57</a>) he says: "He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, abideth in Me, and I in him." Hence this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is the sign of supreme <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and the uplifter of our hope, from such familiar union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with us.

<p>Thirdly, it belongs to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which concerns His humanity just as it does His Godhead, according to <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse1">John 14:1</a>: "You <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in Me." And since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of things unseen, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shows us His Godhead invisibly, so also in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> He shows us His flesh in an invisible manner.

<p>Some men accordingly, not paying heed to these things, have contended that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and blood are not in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> except as in a sign, a thing to be rejected as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, since it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words. Hence Berengarius, who had been the first deviser of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, was afterwards forced to withdraw his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> From this authority the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have taken occasion to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evilly</a> understanding <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> words. For when <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says: "You are not to eat this body which you see," he means not to exclude the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, but that it was not to be eaten in this <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in which it was seen by them. And by the words: "It is a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> that I put before you; in its <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense it will quicken you," he intends not that the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> merely according to mystical signification, but "spiritually," that is, invisibly, and by the power of the spirit. Hence (Tract. xxvii), expounding <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse64">John 6:64</a>: "the flesh profiteth nothing," he says: "Yea, but as they understood it, for they understood that the flesh was to be eaten as it is divided piecemeal in a dead body, or as sold in the shambles, not as it is quickened by the spirit . . . Let the spirit draw nigh to the flesh . . . then the flesh profiteth very much: for if the flesh profiteth nothing, the Word had not been made flesh, that It might dwell among us."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> and all others like it are to be understood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body as it is beheld in its proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; according as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself says (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse11">Matthew 26:11</a>): "But Me you have not always." Nevertheless He is invisibly under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, wherever this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is performed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in the same way as a body is in a place, which by its dimensions is commensurate with the place; but in a special manner which is proper to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Hence we say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is upon many altars, not as in different places, but "sacramentally": and thereby we do not understand that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is there only as in a sign, although a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a kind of sign; but that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is here after a fashion proper to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This argument holds good of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> bodily presence, as He is present after the manner of a body, that is, as it is in its visible appearance, but not as it is spiritually, that is, invisibly, after the manner and by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the spirit. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. xxvii in Joan.) says: "If thou hast understood" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words spiritually concerning His flesh, "they are spirit and life to thee; if thou hast understood them carnally, they are also spirit and life, but not to thee."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether in this sacrament the substance of the bread and wine remains after the consecration?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine does remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>: because <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv): "Since it is customary for men to eat bread and drink wine, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has wedded his Godhead to them, and made them His body and blood": and further on: "The bread of communication is not simple bread, but is united to the Godhead." But wedding together belongs to things actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>. Therefore the bread and wine are at the same time, in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, with the body and the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there ought to be conformity between the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> remains, like the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of water in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of chrism in Confirmation. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine remains also in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, bread and wine are made use of in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, inasmuch as they denote <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">ecclesiastical unity</a>, as "one bread is made from many grains and wine from many grapes," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book on the Creed (Tract. xxvi in Joan.). But this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread and wine. Therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine remains in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. iv): "Although the figure of the bread and wine be seen, still, after the Consecration, they are to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be nothing else than the body end blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have held that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine remains in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. But this opinion cannot stand: first of all, because by such an opinion the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is destroyed, to which it belongs that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; which indeed was not there before the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Now a thing cannot be in any place, where it was not previously, except by change of place, or by the conversion of another thing into itself; just as fire begins anew to be in some house, either because it is carried thither, or because it is generated there. Now it is evident that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body does not begin to be present in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by local motion. First of all, because it would follow that it would cease to be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: for what is moved locally does not come anew to some place unless it quit the former one. Secondly, because every body moved locally passes through all intermediary spaces, which cannot be said here. Thirdly, because it is not possible for one movement of the same body moved locally to be terminated in different places at the one time, whereas the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> begins at the one time to be in several places. And consequently it remains that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body cannot begin to be anew in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> except by change of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread into itself. But what is changed into another thing, no longer remains after such change. Hence the conclusion is that, saving the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread cannot remain after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.

<p>Secondly, because this position is contrary to the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, in which it is said: "This is My body," which would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> if the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread were to remain there; for the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread never is the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Rather should one say in that case: "Here is My body."

<p>Thirdly, because it would be opposed to the veneration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, if any <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> were there, which could not be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with adoration of <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>.

<p>Fourthly, because it is contrary to the rite of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to which it is not lawful to take the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> after bodily food, while it is nevertheless lawful to take one <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> host after another. Hence this opinion is to be avoided as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "wedded His Godhead," i.e. His Divine power, to the bread and wine, not that these may remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but in order that He may make from them His body and blood.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not really present in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as in this; and therefore the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> remains in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but not in this.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as shall be said later (5), suffice for its signification; because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the substance of the bread or wine is annihilated after the consecration of this sacrament, or dissolved into their original matter?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread is annihilated after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, or dissolved into its original <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For whatever is corporeal must be somewhere. But the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread, which is something corporeal, does not remain, in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>); nor can we assign any place where it may be. Consequently it is nothing after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Therefore, it is either annihilated, or dissolved into its original <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is the term "wherefrom" in every change <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> no longer, except in the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; e.g. when air is changed into fire, the form of the air remains only in the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and in like fashion when what is white becomes black. But in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread or of the wine is the term "wherefrom," while the body or the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the term "whereunto": for <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says in De Officiis (De Myster. ix): "Before the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> it is called another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is signified." Therefore, when the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> takes place, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread or wine no longer remains, unless perchance dissolved into its (original) <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one of two contradictories must be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But this proposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "After the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread or wine is something." Consequently, this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread or wine is nothing."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (83): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of tending to nothing." But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is wrought by Divine power. Therefore, in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread or wine is not annihilated.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Because the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine does not remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, some, deeming that it is impossible for the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine to be changed into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh and blood, have maintained that by the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine is either dissolved into the original <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or that it is annihilated.

<p>Now the original <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> into which mixed bodies can be dissolved is the four elements. For dissolution cannot be made into primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so that a subject can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without a form, since <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without a form. But since after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> nothing remains under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> except the body and the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it will be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that the elements into which the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine is dissolved, depart from thence by local motion, which would be perceived by the senses. In like manner also the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread or wine remains until the last instant of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; but in the last instant of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> there is already present there the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the body or blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, just as the form is already present in the last instant of generation. Hence no instant can be assigned in which the original <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> can be there. For it cannot be said that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread or wine is dissolved gradually into the original <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or that it successively quits the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, for if this began to be done in the last instant of its <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, then at the one time under part of the host there would be the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> together with the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread, which is contrary to what has been said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). But if this begin to come to pass before the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, there will then be a time in which under one part of the host there will be neither the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread nor the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is not fitting. They seem indeed to have taken this into careful consideration, wherefore they formulated their proposition with an alternative viz. that (the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>) may be annihilated. But even this cannot stand, because no way can be assigned whereby <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body can begin to be in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, except by the change of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread into it, which change is excluded the moment we admit either annihilation of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread, or dissolution into the original <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Likewise no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can be assigned for such dissolution or annihilation, since the effect of the sacrament is signified by the form: "This is My body." Hence it is clear that the aforesaid opinion is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread or wine, after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, remains neither under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, nor elsewhere; yet it does not follow that it is annihilated; for it is changed into the body of Christ; just as if the air, from which fire is generated, be not there or elsewhere, it does not follow that it is annihilated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The form, which is the term "wherefrom," is not changed into another form; but one form succeeds another in the subject; and therefore the first form remains only in the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But here the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread is changed into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as stated above. Hence the conclusion does not follow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> this proposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the breed is something," still that into which the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread is changed, is something, and consequently the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread is not annihilated.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether bread can be converted into the body of Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that bread cannot be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For conversion is a kind of change. But in every change there must be some subject, which from being previously in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is now in act. because as is said in Phys. iii: "motion is the act of a thing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>." But no subject can be assigned for the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because it is of the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> for it "not to be in a subject," as it is said in Praedic. iii. Therefore it is not possible for the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the form of the thing into which another is <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, begins anew to inhere in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the thing converted into it: as when air is changed into fire not already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, the form of fire begins anew to be in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the air; and in like manner when food is converted into non-pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the form of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> begins to be anew in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the food. Therefore, if bread be changed into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the form of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> begin to be in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the bread, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Consequently, the bread is not changed into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when two things are diverse, one never becomes the other, as whiteness never becomes blackness, as is stated in Phys. i. But since two contrary forms are of themselves diverse, as being the principles of formal difference, so two signate matters are of themselves diverse, as being the principles of material distinction. Consequently, it is not possible for this matter of bread to become this matter whereby <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is individuated, and so it is not possible for this <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread to be changed into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Eusebius Emesenus says: "To thee it ought neither to be a novelty nor an impossibility that earthly and mortal things be changed into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and since it does not begin to be there by local motion, nor is it contained therein as in a place, as is evident from what was stated above (1, ad 2), it must be said then that it begins to be there by conversion of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread into itself.

<p>Yet this change is not like <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> changes, but is entirely <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, and effected by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power alone. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says [(De Sacram. iv): "See how <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> word changes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> laws, as He wills: a man is not wont to be born save of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: see therefore that against the established <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and order a man is born of a <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>": and] [The passage in the brackets is not in the Leonine edition] (De Myster. iv): "It is clear that a Virgin begot beyond the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and what we make is the body from the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>. Why, then, do you look for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> order in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, since the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> was Himself brought forth of a Virgin beyond <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>?" <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> likewise (Hom. xlvii), <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse64">John 6:64</a>: "The words which I have spoken to you," namely, of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, "are spirit and life," says: i.e. "<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, having nothing carnal, nor <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> consequence; but they are rent from all such <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> upon earth, and from the laws here established."

<p>For it is evident that every agent acts according as it is in act. But every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> agent is limited in its act, as being of a determinate genus and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: and consequently the action of every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> agent bears upon some determinate act. Now the determination of every thing in actual <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> comes from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Consequently, no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> agent can act except by changing the form in something; and on this account every change made according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> laws is a formal change. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> act, as stated in I, 7, 1; 26, 2; hence His action extends to the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of being. Therefore He can work not only formal conversion, so that diverse forms succeed each other in the same subject; but also the change of all being, so that, to wit, the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of one thing be changed into the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of another. And this is done by Divine power in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; for the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread is changed into the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, and the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the wine into the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood. Hence this is not a formal, but a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> conversion; nor is it a kind of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement: but, with a name of its own, it can be called "transubstantiation."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection holds good in respect of formal change, because it belongs to a form to be in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or in a subject; but it does not hold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in respect of the change of the entire <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Hence, since this <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> change implies a certain order of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, one of which is changed into the other, it is in both <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> as in a subject, just as order and number.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument also is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of formal conversion or change, because, as stated above (ad 1), a form must be in some <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or subject. But this is not so in a change of the entire <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; for in this case no subject is possible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">Form</a> cannot be changed into form, nor <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by the power of any finite agent. Such a change, however, can be made by the power of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> agent, which has control over all being, because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of being is common to both forms and to both matters; and whatever there is of being in the one, the author of being can change into whatever there is of being in the other, withdrawing that whereby it was distinguished from the other.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the accidents of the bread and wine remain in this sacrament after the change?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of the bread and wine do not remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For when that which comes first is removed, that which follows is also taken away. But <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> before <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Metaph. vii. Since, then, after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread does not remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it seems that its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> cannot remain.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there ought not to be any deception in a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But we judge of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. It seems, then, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment is deceived, if, while the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> remain, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread does not. Consequently this is unbecoming to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, although our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not subject to reason, still it is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but above it, as was said in the beginning of this work (I, 1, 6, ad 2; 8). But our reason has its origin in the senses. Therefore our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ought not to be contrary to the senses, as it is when sense judges that to be bread which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body. Therefore it is not befitting this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of bread to remain subject to the senses, and for the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread not to remain.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, what remains after the change has taken place seems to be the subject of change. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of the bread remain after the change has been effected, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are the subject of the change. But this is impossible; for "an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> cannot have an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>" (Metaph. iii). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of the bread and wine ought not to remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book on the Sentences of Prosper (Lanfranc, De Corp. et Sang. Dom. xiii): "Under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which we behold, of bread and wine, we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> invisible things, i.e. flesh and blood."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is evident to sense that all the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of the bread and wine remain after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. And this is reasonably done by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>. First of all, because it is not customary, but horrible, for men to eat <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, and to drink blood. And therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh and blood are set before us to be partaken of under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of those things which are the more commonly used by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, namely, bread and wine. Secondly, lest this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> might be derided by unbelievers, if we were to eat <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> under His own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Thirdly, that while we receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> body and blood invisibly, this may redound to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As is said in the book De Causis, an effect depends more on the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> than on the second. And therefore by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power, which is the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, it is possible for that which follows to remain, while that which is first is taken away.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There is no deception in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> which are discerned by the senses are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> present. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whose proper object is <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> as is said in De Anima iii, is preserved by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from deception. And this serves as answer to the third argument; because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not contrary to the senses, but concerns things to which sense does not reach.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This change has not properly a subject, as was stated above (4, ad 1); nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> which remain have some resemblance of a subject.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the substantial form of the bread remains in this sacrament after the consecration?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the bread remains in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. For it has been said (5) that the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> remain after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. But since bread is an artificial thing, its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Therefore it remains after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the form of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for it is said in De Anima ii, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> "is the act of a physical body which has life in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>". But it cannot be said that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the bread is changed into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore it appears that it remains after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the proper operation of a things follows its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form. But what remains in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, nourishes, and performs every operation which bread would do were it present. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the bread remains in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of bread is of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread. But the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread is changed into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as stated above (2,3,4). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the bread does not remain.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have contended that after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> not only do the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of the bread remain, but also its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form. But this cannot be. First of all, because if the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the bread were to remain, nothing of the bread would be changed into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, excepting the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and so it would follow that it would be changed, not into the whole body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but into its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is repugnant to the form of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, wherein it is said: "This is My body."

<p>Secondly, because if the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the bread were to remain, it would remain either in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or separated from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. The first cannot be, for if it were to remain in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the bread, then the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread would remain, which is against what was said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Nor could it remain in any other <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, because the proper form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> only in its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But if it were to remain separate from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it would then be an actually intelligible form, and also an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>; for all forms separated from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are such.

<p>Thirdly, it would be unbefitting this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of the bread remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, in order that the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> may be seen under them, and not under its proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>).

<p>And therefore it must be said that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the bread does not remain.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is nothing to prevent art from making a thing whose form is not an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form; as frogs and serpents can be produced by art: for art produces such forms not by its own power, but by the power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> energies. And in this way it produces the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms of bread, by the power of fire baking the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> made up of flour and water.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the form of the body, giving it the whole order of perfect being, i.e. being, corporeal being, and animated being, and so on. Therefore the form of the bread is changed into the form of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, according as the latter gives corporeal being, but not according as it bestows animated being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some of the operations of bread follow it by reason of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, such as to affect the senses, and such operations are found in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the bread after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> which remain. But some other operations follow the bread either by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, such as that it is changed into something else, or else by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, such as an operation consequent upon its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, for instance, that it "strengthens <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart" (<a href="../bible/psa103.htm#verse15">Psalm 103:15</a>); and such operations are found in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not on account of the form or <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> remaining, but because they are bestowed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> themselves, as will be said later (77, 3, ad 2,3; 5,6).

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether this change is wrought instantaneously?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this change is not wrought instantaneously, but successively. For in this change there is first the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread, and afterwards the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body. Neither, then, is in the same instant, but in two instants. But there is a mid-time between every two instants. Therefore this change must take place according to the succession of time, which is between the last instant in which the bread is there, and the first instant in which the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is present.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in every change something is "in becoming" and something is "in being." But these two things do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> at the one time for, what is "in becoming," is not yet, whereas what is "in being," already is. Consequently, there is a before and an after in such change: and so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> the change cannot be instantaneous, but successive.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. iv) that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> "is made by the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words are pronounced successively. Therefore the change takes place successively.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> This change is effected by a power which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, to which it belongs to operate in an instant.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A change may be instantaneous from a threefold reason. First on the part of the form, which is the terminus of the change. For, if it be a form that receives more and less, it is acquired by its subject successively, such as health; and therefore because a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form does not receive more and less, it follows that its introduction into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is instantaneous.

<p>Secondly on the part of the subject, which sometimes is prepared successively for receiving the form; thus water is heated successively. When, however, the subject itself is in the ultimate disposition for receiving the form, it receives it suddenly, as a transparent body is illuminated suddenly. Thirdly on the part of the agent, which possesses <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power: wherefore it can instantly dispose the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Thus it is written (<a href="../bible/mar007.htm#verse34">Mark 7:34</a>) that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had said, "'Ephpheta,' which is 'Be thou opened,' immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed."

<p>For these three reasons this conversion is instantaneous. First, because the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body which is the term of this conversion, does not receive more or less. Secondly, because in this conversion there is no subject to be disposed successively. Thirdly, because it is effected by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some [Cf. Albert the Great, Sent. iv, D, 11; St. Bonaventure, Sent., iv, D, 11] do not grant simply that there is a mid-time between every two instants. For they say that this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of two instants referring to the same movement, but not if they refer to different things. Hence between the instant that marks the close of rest, and another which marks the beginning of movement, there is no mid-time. But in this they are mistaken, because the unity of time and of instant, or even their plurality, is not taken according to movements of any sort, but according to the first movement of the heavens, which is the measure of all movement and rest.

<p>Accordingly others grant this of the time which measures movement depending on the movement of the heavens. But there are some movements which are not dependent on the movement of the heavens, nor measured by it, as was said in I, 53, 3 concerning the movements of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Hence between two instants responding to those movements there is no mid-time. But this is not to the point, because although the change in question has no relation of itself to the movement of the heavens, still it follows the pronouncing of the words, which (pronouncing) must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be measured by the movement of the heavens. And therefore there must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be a mid-time between every two signate instants in connection with that change.

<p>Some say therefore that the instant in which the bread was last, and the instant in which the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is first, are indeed two in comparison with the things measured, but are one comparatively to the time measuring; as when two lines touch, there are two points on the part of the two lines, but one point on the part of the place containing them. But here there is no likeness, because instant and time is not the intrinsic measure of particular movements, as a line and point are of a body, but only the extrinsic measure, as place is to bodies.

<p>Hence others say that it is the same instant in fact, but another according to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. But according to this it would follow that things really opposite would <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> together; for diversity of reason does not change a thing objectively.

<p>And therefore it must be said that this change, as stated above, is wrought by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words which are spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, so that the last instant of pronouncing the words is the first instant in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is in the sacrament; and that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread is there during the whole preceding time. Of this time no instant is to be taken as proximately preceding the last one, because time is not made up of successive instants, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. vi. And therefore a first instant can be assigned in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is present; but a last instant cannot be assigned in which the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread is there, but a last time can be assigned. And the same holds good in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> changes, as is evident from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. viii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In instantaneous changes a thing is "in becoming," and is "in being" simultaneously; just as becoming illuminated and to be actually illuminated are simultaneous: for in such, a thing is said to be "in being" according as it now is; but to be "in becoming," according as it was not before.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (ad 1), this change comes about in the last instant of the pronouncing of the words. for then the meaning of the words is finished, which meaning is efficacious in the forms of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. And therefore it does not follow that this change is successive.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether this proposition is false: "The body of Christ is made out of bread"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this proposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "The body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is made out of bread." For everything out of which another is made, is that which is made the other; but not conversely: for we say that a black thing is made out of a white thing, and that a white thing is made black: and although we may say that a man becomes black still we do not say that a black thing is made out of a man, as is shown in Phys. i. If it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, then, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is made out of bread, it will be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that bread is made the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But this seems to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because the bread is not the subject of the making, but rather its term. Therefore, it is not said <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is made out of bread.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the term of "becoming" is something that is, or something that is "made." But this proposition is never <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "The bread is the body of Christ"; or "The bread is made the body of Christ"; or again, "The bread will be the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Therefore it seems that not even this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "The body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is made out of bread."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everything out of which another is made is converted into that which is made from it. But this proposition seems to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "The bread is converted into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," because such conversion seems to be more <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> than the creation of the world, in which it is not said that non-being is converted into being. Therefore it seems that this proposition likewise is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "The body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is made out of bread."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, that out of which something is made, can be that thing. But this proposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "Bread can be the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Therefore this is likewise <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "The body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is made out of bread."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. iv): "When the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> takes place, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is made out of the bread."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This conversion of bread into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has something in common with creation, and with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> transmutation, and in some respect differs from both. For the order of the terms is common to these three; that is, that after one thing there is another (for, in creation there is being after non-being; in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body after the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread; in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> transmutation white after black, or fire after air); and that the aforesaid terms are not coexistent.

<p>Now the conversion, of which we are speaking, has this in common with creation, that in neither of them is there any common subject belonging to either of the extremes; the contrary of which appears in every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> transmutation.

<p>Again, this conversion has something in common with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> transmutation in two respects, although not in the same fashion. First of all because in both, one of the extremes passes into the other, as bread into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, and air into fire; whereas non-being is not converted into being. But this comes to pass differently on the one side and on the other; for in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread passes into the whole body of Christ; whereas in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> transmutation the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the one receives the form of the other, the previous form being laid aside. Secondly, they have this in common, that on both sides something remains the same; whereas this does not happen in creation: yet differently; for the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or subject remains in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> transmutation; whereas in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the same <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> remain.

<p>From these observations we can gather the various ways of speaking in such matters. For, because in no one of the aforesaid three things are the extremes coexistent, therefore in none of them can one extreme be predicated of the other by the substantive verb of the present tense: for we do not say, "Non-being is being" or, "Bread is the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," or, "Air is fire," or, "White is black." Yet because of the relationship of the extremes in all of them we can use the preposition "ex" [out of, which denotes order; for we can <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and properly say that "being is made out of non-being," and "out of bread, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," and "out of air, fire," and "out of white, black." But because in creation one of the extremes does not pass into the other, we cannot use the word "conversion" in creation, so as to say that "non-being is converted into being": we can, however, use the word in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, just as in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> transmutation. But since in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is converted into the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, on that account this conversion is properly termed transubstantiation.

<p>Again, since there is no subject of this conversion, the things which are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> conversion by reason of the subject, are not to be granted in this conversion. And in the first place indeed it is evident that <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to the opposite follows a subject, by reason whereof we say that "a white thing can be black," or that "air can be fire"; although the latter is not so proper as the former: for the subject of whiteness, in which there is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to blackness, is the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the white thing; since whiteness is not a part thereof; whereas the subject of the form of air is part thereof: hence when it is said, "Air can be fire," it is verified by synecdoche by reason of the part. But in this conversion, and similarly in creation, because there is no subject, it is not said that one extreme can be the other, as that "non-being can be being," or that "bread can be the body of Christ": and for the same reason it cannot be properly said that "being is made of [de] non-being," or that "the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is made of bread," because this preposition "of" [de] denotes a consubstantial <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which consubstantiality of the extremes in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> transmutations is considered according to something common in the subject. And for the same reason it is not granted that "bread will be the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," or that it "may become the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," just as it is not granted in creation that "non-being will be being," or that "non-being may become being," because this manner of speaking is verified in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> transmutations by reason of the subject: for instance, when we say that "a white thing becomes black," or "a white thing will be black."

<p>Nevertheless, since in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, after the change, something remains the same, namely, the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of the bread, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), some of these expressions may be admitted by way of similitude, namely, that "bread is the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," or, "bread will be the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," or "the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is made of bread"; provided that by the word "bread" is not understood the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread, but in general "that which is contained under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of bread," under which <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> there is first contained the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread, and afterwards the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That out of which something else is made, sometimes implies together with the subject, one of the extremes of the transmutation, as when it is said "a black thing is made out of a white one"; but sometimes it implies only the opposite or the extreme, as when it is said--"out of morning comes the day." And so it is not granted that the latter becomes the former, that is, "that morning becomes the day." So likewise in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in hand, although it may be said properly that "the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is made out of bread," yet it is not said properly that "bread becomes the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," except by similitude, as was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That out of which another is made, will sometimes be that other because of the subject which is implied. And therefore, since there is no subject of this change, the comparison does not hold.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In this change there are many more difficulties than in creation, in which there is but this one difficulty, that something is made out of nothing; yet this belongs to the proper mode of production of the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which presupposes nothing else. But in this conversion not only is it difficult for this whole to be changed into that whole, so that nothing of the former may remain (which does not belong to the common mode of production of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>), but furthermore it has this difficulty that the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> remain while the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is destroyed, and many other difficulties of which we shall treat hereafter (77). Nevertheless the word "conversion" is admitted in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but not in creation, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As was observed above, <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> belongs to the subject, whereas there is no subject in this conversion. And therefore it is not granted that bread can be the body of Christ: for this conversion does not come about by the passive <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the creature, but solely by the active power of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>.
