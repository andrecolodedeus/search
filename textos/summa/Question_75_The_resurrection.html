<h1>Question 75. The resurrection</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5075.htm#article1"> Is there to be a resurrection of the body?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5075.htm#article2"> Is it universally of all bodies?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5075.htm#article3"> Is it natural or miraculous?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is to be a resurrection of the body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is not to be a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse12">Job 14:12</a>): "Man, when he is fallen asleep, shall not rise again till the heavens be broken." But the heavens shall never be broken, since the earth, to which seemingly this is still less applicable, "standeth for ever" (<a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse4">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is dead shall never rise again.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> proves the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> by quoting the words: "I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>. He is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the dead but of the living" (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse32">Matthew 22:32</a>; <a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse6">Exodus 3:6</a>). But it is clear that when those words were uttered, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> lived not in body, but only in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore there will be no <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of bodies</a> but only of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>) seemingly proves the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> from the reward for labors endured by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in this life. For if they trusted in this life alone, they would be the most unhappy of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Now there can be sufficient reward for labor in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone: since it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the instrument to be repaid together with the worker, and the body is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> instrument. Wherefore even in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, where <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will be punished for what they did in the body, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is punished without the body. Therefore there is no need to hold a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>, but it is enough to hold a resurrection of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which consists in their being taken from the death of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and unhappiness to the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the last state of a thing is the most perfect, since thereby it attains its end. Now the most perfect state of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to be separated from the body, since in that state it is more conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and is more pure, as being separated from any extraneous <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore separation from the body is its final state, and consequently it returns not from this state to the body, as neither does a man end in becoming a boy.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, bodily death is the punishment inflicted on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for his own transgression, as appears from <a href="../bible/gen002.htm">Genesis 2</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> death, which is the separation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is inflicted on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> never returns to life from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> death after receiving the sentence of his damnation. Therefore neither will there be any return from bodily death to bodily life, and so there will be no <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job019.htm#verse25">Job 19:25-26</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that my Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth, and I shall be clothed again with my skin," etc. Therefore there will be a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse15">Romans 5:15</a>. Now death was brought in by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had not been, there had been no death. Therefore by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will be restored from death to life.

<p>Further, the members should be conformed to the head. Now our Head lives and will live <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> in body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rising again from the dead dieth now no more" (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse8">Romans 6:8</a>). Therefore men who are His members will live in body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and consequently there must needs be a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the various opinions about <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end there have been various opinions holding or denying the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end which all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> desire <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Some have held that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is able to attain this end in this life: wherefore they had no need to admit another life after this, wherein <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would be able to attain to his perfection: and so they denied the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p>This opinion is confuted with sufficient probability by the changeableness of fortune, the weakness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, the imperfection and instability of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, all of which are hindrances to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> argues at the end of De Civ. Dei (xxii, 22).

<p>Hence others maintained that after this there is another life wherein, after death, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lives according to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> only, and they held that such a life sufficed to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire to obtain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: wherefore Porphyrius said as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Civ. De. xxii, 26): "The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, must avoid all bodies": and consequently these did not hold the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p>This opinion was based by various people on various <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> foundations. For certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> asserted that all bodily things are from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> principle, but that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things are from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> principle: and from this it follows that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot reach the height of its perfection unless it be separated from the body, since the latter withdraws it from its principle, the participation of which makes it <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. Hence all those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> sects that hold corporeal things to have been <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> or fashioned by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> deny the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>. The falsehood of this principle has been shown at the beginning of the Second Book (Sent. ii, D, 4, qu. 1, 3; * [Cf. I, 49, 3]).

<p>Others said that the entire <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is seated in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> makes use of the body as an instrument, or as a sailor uses his ship: wherefore according to this opinion, it follows that if <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is attained by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not be balked in his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and so there is no need to hold the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> sufficiently destroys this foundation (De Anima ii, 2), where he shows that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body as form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence it is clear that if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in this life, we must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> hold the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The heavens will never be broken as to their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but as to the effect of their power whereby their movement is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of generation and corruption of lower things: for this reason the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse31">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>): "The fashion of this world passeth away."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, properly speaking, is not <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> himself, but a part of him (and the same as regards the others). Hence life in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not suffice to make <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> a living being, or to make the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of a living <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But there needs to be life in the whole composite, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body: and although this life were not actually when these words were uttered, it was in each part as ordained to the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> proves the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> with the greatest subtlety and efficacy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is compared to the body, not only as a worker to the instrument with which he works, but also as form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: wherefore the work belongs to the composite and not to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> shows (De Anima i, 4). And since to the worker is due the reward of the work, it behooves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself, who is composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, to receive the reward of his work. Now as venial offenses are called <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as being dispositions to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and not as having simply and perfectly the character of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so the punishment which is awarded to them in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> is not a retribution simply, but rather a cleansing, which is wrought separately in the body, by death and by its being reduced to ashes, and in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Other things being equal, the state of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the body is more perfect than outside the body, because it is a part of the whole composite; and every integral part is material in comparison to the whole: and though it were conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in one respect, it is not simply. Because, strictly speaking, a thing is more conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when it has all that the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> requires, since then most of all it imitates the Divine perfection. Hence the heart of an animal is more conformed to an immovable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when it is in movement than when it is at rest, because the perfection of the heart is in its movement, and its rest is its undoing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Bodily death was brought about by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which was blotted out by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death: hence its punishment lasts not for ever. But mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> everlasting death through impenitence will not be expiated hereafter. Hence that death will be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">everlasting</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the resurrection will be for all without exception?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will not be for all without exception. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse5">Psalm 1:5</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall not rise again in judgment." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> will not rise again except at the time of the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">general judgment</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall in no way rise again.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse2">Daniel 12:2</a>): "Many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake." But these words imply a restriction. Therefore all will not rise again.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> men are conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rising again</a>; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> argues (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 15:12, seqq.</a>) that if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rose again, we also shall rise again. Now those alone should be conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rising again</a> who have borne His image, and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> alone. Therefore they alone shall rise again.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, punishment is not remitted unless the fault be condoned. Now bodily death is the punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not forgiven to all, all will not rise again.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, as we are born again by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even so shall we rise again by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now those who die in their mother's womb can never be born again: therefore neither can they rise again, and consequently all will not rise again.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse28">John 5:28,35</a>): "All that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> . . . and they that hear shall live." Therefore the dead shall all rise again.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse51">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>): "We shall all indeed rise again," etc.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order that those who rise again may receive punishment or reward according to their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Now either punishment or reward is due to all, either for their own <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, as to adults, or for others' <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, as to children. Therefore all will rise again.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Those things, the reason of which comes from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, must needs be found likewise in all the members of that same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now such is the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>: because the reason thereof, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), is that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot have the final perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, so long as it is separated from the body. Hence no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will remain for ever separated from the body. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for all, as well as for one, to rise again.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds these words, they refer to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> resurrection whereby the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall not rise again in the particular judgment. or else they refer to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> who are altogether unbelievers, who will not rise again to be judged, since they are already judged [<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse18">John 3:18</a>].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xx, 23) explains "many" as meaning "all": in fact, this way of speaking is often met with in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. Or else the restriction may refer to the children consigned to <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> who, although they shall rise again, are not properly said to awake, since they will have no sense either of pain or of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and waking is the unchaining of the senses.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All, both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, are conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while living in this life, as regards things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but not as regards matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence all will be conformed to Him in the restoration of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> life, but not in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, except the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Those who have died in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> have, by dying, discharged the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of death which is the punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Hence, notwithstanding <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, they can rise again from death: for the punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is to die, rather than to be detained by death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> We are born again by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> that is given to us, but we rise again by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> whereby it came about that He took our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since it is by this that we are conformed to Him in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things. Hence those who die in their mother's womb, although they are not born again by receiving <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, will nevertheless rise again on account of the conformity of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with Him, which conformity they acquired by attaining to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the resurrection is natural?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. For, as the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 14), "that which is commonly observed in all, marks the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> contained under it." Now <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> applies commonly to all. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xiv, 55): "Those who do not hold the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> on the principle of obedience ought certainly to hold it on the principle of reason. For what does the world every day but imitate, in its elements, our <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>?" And he offers as examples the light which "as it were dies . . . and is withdrawn from our sight . . . and again rises anew, as it were, and is recalled--the shrubs which lose their greenery, and again by a kind of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> are renewed--and the seeds which rot and die and then sprout and rise again as it were": which same example is adduced by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse36">1 Corinthians 15:36</a>). Now from the works of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nothing can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> save what is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things that are against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> abide not for long, because they are <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>, so to speak. But the life that is restored by the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will last for ever. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, that to which the entire expectation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> looks forward would seem to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Now such a thing is the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> and the glorification of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse19">Romans 8:19</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is a kind of movement towards the everlasting union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. Now movement is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> if it terminate in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> rest (Phys. v, 6): and the everlasting union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body will be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, for since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the body's proper mover, it has a body proportionate to it: so that the body is likewise for ever capable of being quickened by it, even as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> lives for ever. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> There is no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> return from privation to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But death is privation of life. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> whereby one returns from death to life is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p>Further, things of the one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> have one fixed way of origin: wherefore animals begotten of putrefaction are never of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as those begotten of seed, as the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> says on Phys. viii. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> way of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> origin is for him to be begotten of a like in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: and such is not the case in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. Therefore it will not be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A movement or an action stands related to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in three ways. For there is a movement or action whereof <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is neither the principle nor the term: and such a movement is sometimes from a principle above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as in the case of a glorified body; and sometimes from any other principle whatever; for instance, the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> upward movement of a stone which terminates in a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> rest. Again, there is a movement whereof <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is both principle and term: for instance, the downward movement of a stone. And there is another movement whereof <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the term, but not the principle, the latter being sometimes something above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (as in giving sight to a blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for sight is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, but the principle of the sight-giving is above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>), and sometimes something else, as in the forcing of flowers or fruit by artificial process. It is impossible for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be the principle and not the term, because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles are appointed to definite effects, beyond which they cannot extend.

<p>Accordingly the action or movement that is related to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the first way can nowise be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, but is either <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> if it come from a principle above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> if from any other principle. The action or movement that is related to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the second way is simply <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>: but the action that is related to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the third way cannot be described as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> simply, but as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> in a restricted sense, in so far, to wit, as it leads to that which is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: but it is called either <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> or artificial or <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>. For, properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> is that which is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and a thing is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> if it has that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and whatever results from that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (Phys. ii, 1). Consequently, speaking simply, movement cannot be described as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> unless its principle be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be the principle of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, although <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> terminates in the life of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the principle of movement in the thing wherein <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is--either the active principle, as in the movement of heavy and light bodies and in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> alterations of animals--or the passive principle, as in the generation of simple bodies. The passive principle of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> passive <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> which always has an active principle corresponding to it in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to Metaphysics viii, 1: nor as to this does it matter whether the active principle in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> correspond to the passive principle in respect of its ultimate perfection, namely the form; or in respect of a disposition in virtue of which it demands the ultimate form, as in the generation of a man according to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or in all other generations according to the opinions of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there is no active principle of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, neither as regards the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the body, nor as regards the disposition which is the demand for that union: since such a disposition cannot be produced by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, except in a definite way by the process of generation from seed. Wherefore even granted a passive <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> on the part of the body, or any kind of inclination to its union with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it is not such as to suffice for the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, strictly speaking, is <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> and not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> except in a restricted sense, as we have explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> is speaking of those things that are found in all <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the principles of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For supposing by a divine operation all men to be made white, or to be gathered together in one place, as happened at the time of the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">deluge</a>, it would not follow that whiteness or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in some particular place is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> property of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things one does not come by a demonstration of reason to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> non-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, but by the induction of reason one may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bears a certain resemblance to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. Thus the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body resembles the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of fruition, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. ii, D, 1): and in like manner the examples, quoted by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, are confirmatory evidences of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument regards an operation which terminates in something that is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> but contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Such is not the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, and hence the argument is not to the point.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The entire operation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is subordinate to the Divine operation, just as the working of a lower art is subordinate to the working of a higher art. Hence just as all the work of a lower art has in view an end unattainable save by the operation of the higher art that produces the form, or makes use of what has been made by art: so the last end which the whole expectation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has in view is unattainable by the operation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and for which reason the attaining thereto is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Although there can be no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement terminating in a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> rest, there can be a non-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement terminating in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> rest, as explained above.
