<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is lawful to curse anyone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful to curse anyone. For it is unlawful to disregard the command of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> in whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spoke, according to <a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse3">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>. Now he commanded (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse14">Romans 12:14</a>), "Bless and curse not." Therefore it is not lawful to curse anyone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all are bound to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse82">Daniel 3:82</a>, "O ye sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the Lord." Now the same mouth cannot both <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and curse <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the third chapter of James. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may lawfully curse another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, he that curses another would seem to wish him some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> either of fault or of punishment, since a curse appears to be a kind of imprecation. But it is not lawful to wish ill to anyone, indeed we are bound to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that all may be delivered from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore it is unlawful for any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to curse.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> exceeds all in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> on account of his obstinacy. But it is not lawful to curse the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as neither is it lawful to curse oneself; for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir021.htm#verse30">Sirach 21:30</a>): "While the ungodly curseth the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, he curseth his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Much less therefore is it lawful to curse a man.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/num023.htm#verse8">Numbers 23:8</a>, "How shall I curse whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath not <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a>?" says: "There cannot be a just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for cursing a sinner if one be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his sentiments." Now one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> sentiments, nor whether he is <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may lawfully curse another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu027.htm#verse26">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>): "<a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">Cursed</a> be he that abideth not in the words of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." Moreover Eliseus <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> the little boys who mocked him (<a href="../bible/2ki002.htm#verse24">2 Kings 2:24</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To curse [maledicere] is the same as to speak ill [malum dicere]. Now "speaking" has a threefold relation to the thing spoken. First, by way of assertion, as when a thing is expressed in the indicative mood: in this way "maledicere" signifies simply to tell someone of another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and this pertains to backbiting, wherefore tellers of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> [maledici] are sometimes called backbiters. Secondly, speaking is related to the thing spoken, by way of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> first and foremost, since He made all things by His word, according to <a href="../bible/psa032.htm#verse9">Psalm 32:9</a>, "He spoke and they were made"; while secondarily it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who, by his word, commands others and thus moves them to do something: it is for this purpose that we employ verbs in the imperative mood. Thirdly, "speaking" is related to the thing spoken by expressing the sentiments of one who desires that which is expressed in words; and for this purpose we employ the verb in the optative mood.

<p>Accordingly we may omit the first kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speaking which is by way of simple assertion of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and consider the other two kinds. And here we must observe that to do something and to will it are consequent on one another in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, as shown above (I-II, 20, 3). Hence in these two ways of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speaking, by way of command and by way of desire, there is the same aspect of lawfulness and unlawfulness, for if a man commands or desires another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, being intent on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> itself, then <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speaking will be unlawful in both ways, and this is what is meant by cursing. On the other hand if a man commands or desires another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is lawful; and it may be called cursing, not strictly speaking, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, because the chief <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the speaker is directed not to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> but to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may be spoken, by commanding or desiring it, under the aspect of a twofold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Sometimes under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and thus a judge lawfully curses a man whom he condemns to a just penalty: thus too the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> curses by pronouncing <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. On the same way the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> sometimes call down <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> on sinners, as though conforming their will to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, although such like imprecation may be taken by way of foretelling. Sometimes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is spoken under the aspect of useful, as when one wishes a sinner to suffer sickness or hindrance of some kind, either that he may himself reform, or at least that he may cease from harming others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> forbids cursing strictly so called with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> intent: and the same answer applies to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To wish another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is not opposed to the sentiment whereby one wishes him <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, in fact rather is it in conformity therewith.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and guilt must be considered. His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> indeed is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nor is it lawful to curse it. On the other hand his guilt is deserving of being <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job003.htm#verse8">Job 3:8</a>, "Let them curse it who curse the day." Yet when a sinner curses the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> on account of his guilt, for the same reason he judges himself worthy of being <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a>; and in this sense he is said to curse his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Although the sinner's sentiments cannot be perceived in themselves, they can be perceived through some manifest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which has to be punished. Likewise although it is not possible to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> curses in respect of final reprobation, it is possible to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who is <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">accursed</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in respect of being guilty of present <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is lawful to curse an irrational creature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is unlawful to curse an irrational creature. Cursing would seem to be lawful chiefly in its relation to punishment. Now irrational creatures are not competent subjects either of guilt or of punishment. Therefore it is unlawful to curse them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in an irrational creature there is nothing but the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made. But it is unlawful to curse this even in the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore it is nowise lawful to curse an irrational creature.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, irrational creatures are either stable, as bodies, or transient, as the seasons. Now, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. iv, 2), "it is useless to curse what does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to curse what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>." Therefore it is nowise lawful to curse an irrational creature.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> the fig tree, as related in <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse19">Matthew 21:19</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> his day, according to <a href="../bible/job003.htm#verse1">Job 3:1</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Benediction and malediction, properly speaking, regard things to which <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may happen, viz. rational creatures: while <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are said to happen to irrational creatures in relation to the rational creature for whose sake they are. Now they are related to the rational creature in several ways. First by way of ministration, in so far as irrational creatures minister to the needs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. On this sense the Lord said to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse17">Genesis 3:17</a>): "<a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">Cursed</a> is the earth in thy work," so that its barrenness would be a punishment to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Thus also David <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> the mountains of Gelboe, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory's</a> expounding (Moral. iv, 3). Again the irrational creature is related to the rational creature by way of signification: and thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> the fig tree in signification of Judea. Thirdly, the irrational creature is related to rational creatures as something containing them, namely by way of time or place: and thus <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> the day of his birth, on account of the <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> which he contracted in birth, and on account of the consequent penalties. On this sense also we may understand David to have <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> the mountains of Gelboe, as we read in <a href="../bible/2sa001.htm#verse21">2 Samuel 1:21</a>, namely on account of the people slaughtered there.

<p>But to curse irrational beings, considered as creatures of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; while to curse them considered in themselves is idle and vain and consequently unlawful.

<p>From this the Replies to the objections may easily be gathered.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether cursing is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that cursing is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> On the Fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> [Serm. civ in the appendix of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> works] reckons cursing among slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are venial. Therefore cursing is not a mortal but a venial Sin.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which proceeds from a slight movement of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> does not seem to be generically a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But cursing sometimes arises from a slight movement. Therefore cursing is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are worse than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> words. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are not always mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Much less therefore is cursing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Nothing save mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> excludes one from the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. But cursing excludes from the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 6:10</a>, "Nor cursers [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'railers'], nor extortioners shall possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Therefore cursing is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> words of which we are speaking now are those whereby <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is uttered against someone by way of command or desire. Now to wish <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or to conduce to that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by commanding it, is, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby we love our neighbor by desiring his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to its genus, and so much the graver, as the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whom we curse has a greater claim on our love and respect. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/lev020.htm#verse9">Leviticus 20:9</a>): "He that curseth his father, or mother, dying let him die."

<p>It may happen however that the word uttered in cursing is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> either through the slightness of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> invoked on another in cursing him, or on account of the sentiments of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who utters the curse; because he may say such words through some slight movement, or in jest, or without deliberation, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of word should be weighed chiefly with regard to the speaker's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, as stated above (Question 72, Article 2).

<p>From this the Replies to the Objections may be easily gathered.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether cursing is a graver sin than backbiting?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that cursing is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than backbiting. Cursing would seem to be a kind of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, as implied in the <a href="../bible/jud001.htm#verse9">canonical epistle of Jude (verse 9)</a> where it is said that "when Michael the archangel, disputing with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, contended about the body of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, he durst not bring against him the judgment of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'railing speech']," where <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> stands for cursing, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than backbiting. Therefore cursing is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than backbiting.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is more grievous than backbiting, as stated above (Question 73, Article 3). But cursing is on a par with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>; for <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xix, super Matth.): "When thou sayest: 'Curse him down with his house, away with everything,' you are no better than a murderer." Therefore cursing is graver than backbiting.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a thing is more than to signify it. But the curser <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by commanding it, whereas the backbiter merely signifies an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>. Therefore the curser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously than the backbiter.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is impossible to do well in backbiting, whereas cursing may be either a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, as appears from what has been said (1). Therefore backbiting is graver than cursing.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in I, 48, 5, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is twofold, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment; and of the two, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault is the worse (I, 48, 6). Hence to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault is worse than to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment, provided the mode of speaking be the same. Accordingly it belongs to the reviler, the tale-bearer, the backbiter and the derider to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault, whereas it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>-speaker, as we understand it here, to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment, and not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault except under the aspect of punishment. But the mode of speaking is not the same, for in the case of the four <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> mentioned above, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault is spoken by way of assertion, whereas in the case of cursing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment is spoken, either by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> it in the form of a command, or by wishing it. Now the utterance itself of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> fault is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in as much as it inflicts an injury on one's neighbor, and it is more grievous to inflict an injury, than to wish to inflict it, other things being equal.

<p>Hence backbiting considered in its generic aspect is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than the cursing which expresses a mere desire; while the cursing which is expressed by way of command, since it has the aspect of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, will be more or less grievous than backbiting, according as it inflicts an injury more or less grave than the blackening of a man's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>. Moreover this must be taken as applying to these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> considered in their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> aspects: for other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> points might be taken into consideration, which would aggravate or extenuate the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To curse a creature, as such, reflects on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thus <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> it has the character of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; not so if one curse a creature on account of its fault: and the same applies to backbiting.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), cursing, in one way, includes the desire for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, where if the curser desire the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of another's <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> death, he does not differ, in desire, from a murderer, but he differs from him in so far as the external act adds something to the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers cursing by way of command.
