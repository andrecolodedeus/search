<h1>Question 76. The cause of the resurrection</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5076.htm#article1"> Is Christ's resurrection the cause of our resurrection?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5076.htm#article2"> Is the sound of the trumpet?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5076.htm#article3"> Are the angels?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the resurrection of Christ is the cause of our resurrection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of Christ</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>. For, given the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the effect follows. Yet given the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the other dead</a> did not follow at once. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His resurrection</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an effect cannot be unless the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> precede. But the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> would be even if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen again</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could have delivered <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in some other way. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same thing produces the one effect throughout the one same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will be common to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Since then <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> is not its own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of others</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, an effect retains some likeness to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, at least of some, namely the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, bears no likeness to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of Christ</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> will not be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of theirs.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "In every genus that which is first is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of those that come after it" (Metaph. ii, 1). Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by reason of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His bodily resurrection</a>, is called "the first-fruits of them that sleep" (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>), and "the first-begotten of the dead" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse5">Apocalypse 1:5</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of others</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> has more in common with our <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">bodily resurrection</a> than with our <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> resurrection which is by <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans 4:25</a>, where it is said that He "rose again for our <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">bodily resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by reason of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is called the mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men: wherefore the Divine <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are bestowed on men by means of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity. Now just as we cannot be delivered from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> death save by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so neither can we be delivered from bodily death except by <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> wrought by the Divine power. And therefore as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in respect of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, received the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from above, and His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, because "of His fulness we all have received . . . <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>), so in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a> begun, and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours. Thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is, as it were, the equivocal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rising again, He is the proximate and, so to say, the univocal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>. Now a univocal efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> produces its effect in likeness to its own form, so that not only is it an efficient, but also an exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in relation to that effect. This happens in two ways. For sometimes this very form, whereby the agent is likened to its effect, is the direct principle of the action by which the effect is produced, as heat in the fire that heats: and sometimes it is not the form in respect of which this likeness is observed, that is primarily and directly the principle of that action, but the principles of that form. For instance, if a white <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> beget a white <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the whiteness of the begetter is not the principle of active generation, and yet the whiteness of the begetter is said to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the whiteness of the begotten, because the principles of whiteness in the begetter are the generative principles <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> whiteness in the begotten. In this way the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>, because the same thing that wrought the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of Christ</a>, which is the univocal efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>, is the active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>, namely the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead which is common to Him and the Father. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans 8:11</a>): "He that raised up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies." And this very <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of Christ</a> by virtue of His indwelling Godhead is the quasi-instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>: since the Divine operations were wrought by means of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh, as though it were a kind of organ; thus the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> instances as an example (De Fide Orth. iii, 15) the touch of His body whereby He healed the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse3">Matthew 8:3</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> produces at once its effect to which it is immediately directed, but not the effect to which it is directed by means of something else, no matter how sufficient it may be: thus heat, however intense it be, does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> heat at once in the first instant, but it begins at once to set up a movement towards heat, because heat is its effect by means of movement. Now <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> is said to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours, in that it works <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>, not immediately, but by means of its principle, namely the Divine power which will work <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a> in likeness to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of Christ</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power works by means of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which is nearest to the effect; hence it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a> should follow straightway after He has wrought the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of Christ</a>, but that it should happen at the time which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will has decreed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power is not tied to any particular second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, but that He can produce their effects either immediately or by means of other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: thus He might work the generation of lower bodies even though there were no movement of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and yet according to the order which He has established in things, the movement of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the generation of the lower bodies. In like manner according to the order appointed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours: and yet He could have appointed another order, and then <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a> would have had another <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument holds when all the things of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> have the same order to the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the effect to be produced in the whole of that <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But it is not so in the case in point, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity is nearer to His Godhead, Whose power is the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, than is the humanity of others. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His resurrection</a> immediately, but it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of others</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ-man rising again</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of all men</a> will bear some resemblance to <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a>, as regards that which pertains to the life of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in respect of which all were conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence all will <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again</a> to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life; but in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who were conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, there will be conformity as to things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the sound of the trumpet will be the cause of our resurrection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the sound of the trumpet will not be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv): "Thou must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will take place by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, power, and nod." Therefore since these are a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, we ought not to assign the sound of the trumpet as a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is useless to make sounds to one who cannot hear. But the dead will not have hearing. Therefore it is unfitting to make a sound to arouse them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if any sound is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, this will only be by a power given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the sound: wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse34">Psalm 67:34</a>, "He will give to His voice the voice of power," says: "to arouse our bodies." Now from the moment that a power is given to a thing, though it be given <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>, the act that ensues is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, as instanced in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> born blind who, after being restored to sight, saw <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Therefore if a sound be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> would be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>: which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> Himself will come down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> . . . with the trumpet of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the dead who are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shall rise."

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse28">John 5:28</a>) that they "who are in the graves shall hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> . . . and (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse25">John 5:25</a>) they that hear shall live." Now this voice is called the trumpet, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 43). Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Cause and effect must needs in some way be united together, since mover and moved, maker and made, are simultaneous (Phys. vii, 2). Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rising again is the univocal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>: wherefore at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of bodies</a>, it behooves <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to work the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> at the giving of some common bodily sign. According to some this sign will be literally <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> voice commanding the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, even as He commanded the sea and the storm ceased (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse26">Matthew 8:26</a>). Others say that this sign will be nothing else than the manifest appearance of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the world, according to the words of <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse27">Matthew 24:27</a>: "As lightning cometh out of the east, and appeareth even into the west, so shall also the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be." These rely on the authority of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [Moral. xxxi, as quoted by <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">St. Albert the Great</a>, Sentent. iv, D, 42, 4] who says that "the sound of the trumpet is nothing else but the Son appearing to the world as judge." According to this, the visible presence of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is called His voice, because as soon as He appears all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> will obey His command in restoring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies: hence He is described as coming "with commandment" (<a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>). In this way His appearing, in so far as it has the force of a command, is called His voice: which voice, whatever it be, is sometimes called a cry [<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse6">Matthew 25:6</a>, as of a crier summoning to judgment; sometimes the sound of a trumpet [<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse52">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>, either on account of its distinctness, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 43), or as being in keeping with the use of the trumpet in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>: for by the trumpet they were summoned to the council, stirred to the battle, and called to the feast; and those who rise again will be summoned to the council of judgment, to the battle in which "the world shall fight . . . against the unwise" (<a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse21">Wisdom 5:21</a>), and to the feast of everlasting <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In those words the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> touches on three things respecting the material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>: to wit, the Divine will which commands, the power which executes, and the ease of execution, when he adds "bidding," in resemblance to our own affairs: since it is very easy for us to do what is done at once at our word. But the ease is much more evident, if before we say a word, our servants execute our will at once at the first sign of our will, which sign is called a nod: and this nod is a kind of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that execution, in so far as others are led thereby to accomplish our will. And the Divine nod, at which the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will take place, is nothing but the sign given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> will obey by concurring in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>. This sign is the same as the sound of the trumpet, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the forms of the Sacrament have the power to sanctify, not through being heard, but through being spoken: so this sound, whatever it be, will have an instrumental efficacy of resuscitation, not through being perceived, but through being uttered. Even so a sound by the pulsation of the air arouses the sleeper, by loosing the organ of perception, and not because it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: since judgment about the sound that reaches the ears is subsequent to the awakening and is not its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument would avail, if the power given to that sound were a complete being in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: because then that which would proceed therefrom would have for principle a power already rendered <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. But this power is not of that kind but such as we have ascribed above to the forms of the Sacraments (Sent. iv, D, 1; I, 62, 1,4).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the angels will do anything towards the resurrection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will do nothing at all towards the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. For raising the dead shows a greater power than does begetting men. Now when men are begotten, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not infused into the body by means of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore neither will the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, which is reunion of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, be wrought by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if this is to be ascribed to the instrumentality of any <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> at all, it would seem especially referable to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, to whom it belongs to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Yet it is referred, not to them, but to the archangels, according to the text (Sent. iv, D, 43). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will not be wrought by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated (<a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> . . . shall come down from heaven . . . with the voice of an archangel . . . and the dead shall rise again." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> will be accomplished by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> ministry.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. iii, 4) "just as the grosser and inferior bodies are ruled in a certain order by the more subtle and more powerful bodies, so are all bodies ruled by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the rational spirit of life": and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> speaks in the same sense (Dial. iv, 6). Consequently in all <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> bodily works, He employs the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Now in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> there is something pertaining to the transmutation of the bodies, to wit the gathering together of the mortal remains and the disposal thereof for the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body; wherefore in this respect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will employ the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even as it is immediately <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so will it be reunited to the body immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without any operation of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: and in like manner He Himself will glorify the body without the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, just as He immediately glorifies <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is called their voice, according to one explanation given in the text (Sent. iv, D, 43).

<p>Hence the Reply to the First Objection is evident from what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This ministry will be exercised chiefly by one Archangel, namely Michael, who is the prince of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as he was of the Synagogue (<a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse13">Daniel 10:13-21</a>). Yet he will act under the influence of the Virtues and the other higher orders: so that what he shall do, the higher orders will, in a way, do also. In like manner the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will co-operate with him as to the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> to whose guardianship they were appointed: so that this voice can be ascribed either to one or to many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.
