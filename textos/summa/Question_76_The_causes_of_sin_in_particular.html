<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether ignorance can be a cause of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> cannot be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because a non-being is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of anything. Now <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is a non-being, since it is a privation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should be reckoned in respect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being a "turning to" something, as was stated above (Question 75, Article 1). Now <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> seems to savor of "turning away" from something. Therefore it should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is seated in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not turn to that which is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, because its object is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apprehended. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> cannot be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. et Grat. lxvii) "that some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. viii, 27) a moving <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is twofold, direct and indirect. A direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is one that moves by its own power, as the generator is the moving <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of heavy and light things. An indirect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is either one that removes an impediment, or the removal itself of an impediment: and it is in this way that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act; because it is a privation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> perfecting the reason that forbids the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as it directs <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>.

<p>Now we must observe that the reason directs <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> in accordance with a twofold <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, universal and particular: because in conferring about what is to be done, it employs a syllogism, the conclusion of which is an act of judgment, or of choice, or an operation. Now actions are about singulars: wherefore the conclusion of a practical syllogism is a singular proposition. But a singular proposition does not follow from a universal proposition, except through the medium of a particular proposition: thus a man is restrained from an act of parricide, by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that it is wrong to kill one's father, and that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is his father. Hence <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> about either of these two propositions, viz. of the universal principle which is a rule of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, or of the particular circumstance, could <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> an act of parricide. Hence it is clear that not every kind of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that alone which removes the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which would prevent the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act. Consequently if a man's will be so disposed that he would not be restrained from the act of parricide, even though he recognized his father, his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> about his father is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his committing the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is concomitant with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: wherefore such a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, not "through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>" but "in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. iii, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Non-being cannot be the direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of anything: but it can be an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as being the removal of an impediment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is removed by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, regards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as turning towards something, so too, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of this respect of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as removing its impediment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The will cannot turn to that which is absolutely unknown: but if something be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in one respect, and unknown in another, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can will it. It is thus that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for instance, when a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that what he is killing is a man, but not that it is his own father; or when one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that a certain act is pleasurable, but not that it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether ignorance is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is "a word, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> or desire contrary to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>," as stated above (Question 71, Article 5). Now <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not denote an act, either internal or external. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now privation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but a punishment resulting from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which is privation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this can only be in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. But if <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through being <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will consist in the act itself of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, rather than in the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> will not be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but rather a result of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is taken away by repentance, nor does any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except only <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, pass as to guilt, yet remain in act. Now <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is not removed by repentance, but remains in act, all its guilt being removed by repentance. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless perchance it be <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, then a man will be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, as long as he remains in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is continual in the one who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> would be continually <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, else <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> would be a most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Nothing but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deserves punishment. But <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> deserves punishment, according to <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse38">1 Corinthians 14:38</a>: "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, he shall not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> differs from nescience, in that nescience denotes mere absence of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; wherefore whoever lacks <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about anything, can be said to be nescient about it: in which sense <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> puts nescience in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (Coel. Hier. vii). On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> denotes privation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, i.e. lack of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those things that one has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Some of these we are under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, those, to wit, without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which we are unable to accomplish a due act rightly. Wherefore all are bound in common to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, and the universal principles of right, and each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is bound to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> matters regarding his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> or state. Meanwhile there are other things which a man may have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, yet he is not bound to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, such as the geometrical theorems, and contingent particulars, except in some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> case. Now it is evident that whoever neglects to have or do what he ought to have or do, commits a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>. Wherefore through negligence, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of what one is bound to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; whereas it is not imputed as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if he fails to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he is unable to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of such like things is called "invincible," because it cannot be overcome by study. For this reason such like <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, not being <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, since it is not in our power to be rid of it, is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: wherefore it is evident that no invincible <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On the other hand, vincible <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if it be about matters one is bound to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but not, if it be about things one is not bound to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (71, 6, ad 1), when we say that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a "word, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> or desire," we include the opposite negations, by reason of which omissions have the character of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; so that negligence, in as much as <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is comprised in the above definition of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; in so far as one omits to say what one ought, or to do what one ought, or to desire what one ought, in order to acquire the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which we ought to have.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although privation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in itself, yet by reason of negligence in preparing oneself for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it may have the character of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; nevertheless even here there is a difference, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by his acts, whereas <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not acquired by acts, but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> favor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as in a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of transgression, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists not only in the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but also in the act willed, which is commanded by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; so in a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> not only the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also the <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, in so far as it is in some way <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>; and accordingly, the neglect to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, or even lack of consideration is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although when the guilt has passed away through repentance, the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> remains, according as it is a privation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, nevertheless the negligence does not remain, by reason of which the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is said to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Just as in other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> actually only at the time at which the affirmative precept is binding, so is it with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> actually indeed, not continually, but only at the time for acquiring the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that he ought to have.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether ignorance excuses from sin altogether?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether. For as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 9), every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness, as stated above (Question 6, Article 8). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is done beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, is done <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> cannot be about what is unknown. Therefore what a man does through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. But what is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> does not give the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore nothing that is done through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, should be deemed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, inasmuch as he is partaker of reason. Now <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> excludes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which perfects the reason. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. iii, 18) that "some things done through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> are rightly reproved." Now those things alone are rightly reproved which are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore some things done through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not altogether excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a>, by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, renders the act which it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntary. Now it has already been stated (1,2) that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is said to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the act which the contrary <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> would have prevented; so that this act, if <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> were to hand, would be contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the meaning of the word involuntary. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is removed by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, would not have prevented the act, on account of the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> thereto, the lack of this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not make that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> unwilling, but not willing, as stated in Ethic. iii, 1: and such like <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, as already stated, since it does not make the act to be involuntary, does not excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The same applies to any <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but follows or accompanies the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act.

<p>On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the act, since it makes it to be involuntary, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because voluntariness is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But it may fail to excuse altogether from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and this for two reasons. First, on the part of the thing itself which is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as something is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it may happen that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> ignores some circumstance of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which circumstance would prevent him from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, whether it belong to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or not; and nevertheless his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is sufficient for him to be aware that the act is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>; for instance, if a man strike someone, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is a man (which suffices for it to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>) and yet be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the fact that it is his father, (which is a circumstance constituting another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>); or, suppose that he is unaware that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will defend himself and strike him back, and that if he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> this, he would not have struck him (which does not affect the sinfulness of the act). Wherefore, though this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, yet he is not altogether excused, because, not withstanding, he has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Secondly, this may happen on the part of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> itself, because, to wit, this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, either directly, as when a man wishes of set purpose to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of certain things that he may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the more freely; or indirectly, as when a man, through stress of work or other occupations, neglects to acquire the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which would restrain him from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For such like negligence renders the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> itself <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, provided it be about matters one is bound and able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Consequently this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not altogether excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> be such as to be entirely involuntary, either through being invincible, or through being of matters one is not bound to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, then such like <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not every <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> involuntariness, as stated above (Question 6, Article 8). Hence not every <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> So far as voluntariness remains in the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> remains in him: so that, in this respect, his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> be such as to exclude the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> entirely, it excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether, as is the case with <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a> and imbeciles: but such is not always the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so it does not always excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether ignorance diminishes a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not diminish a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For that which is common to all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> does not diminish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is common to all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 1) that "every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not diminish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> added to another makes a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is itself a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore it does not diminish a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same thing does not both aggravate and diminish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> aggravates <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse4">Romans 2:4</a>, "Knowest thou not that the benignity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> leadeth thee to penance?" says: "Thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is most grievous if thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> not." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not diminish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if any kind of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> diminishes a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this would seem to be chiefly the case as regards the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which removes the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> altogether. Now this kind of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not diminish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but increases it: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 5) that the "punishment is doubled for a <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunken</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not diminish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever is a reason for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be forgiven, diminishes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now such is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, as is clear from <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse13">1 Timothy 1:13</a>: "I obtained . . . mercy . . . because I did it ignorantly." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> diminishes or alleviates <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> can diminish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as it diminishes its voluntariness; and if it does not render it less <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, it nowise alleviates the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether (through making it altogether involuntary) does not diminish a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but does away with it altogether. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being committed, but is concomitant with it, neither diminishes nor increases the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be alleviated by any <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but only by such as is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being committed, and yet does not excuse from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether. Now it happens sometimes that such like <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is directly and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as when a man is purposely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that he may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more freely, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of this kind seems rather to make the act more <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and more <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, since it is through the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that he is willing to bear the hurt of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, for the sake of freedom in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Sometimes, however, the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being committed, is not directly <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, but indirectly or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as when a man is unwilling to work hard at his studies, the result being that he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, or as when a man willfully drinks too much wine, the result being that he becomes drunk and indiscreet, and this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> diminishes voluntariness and consequently alleviates the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For when a thing is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be said to consent to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> directly, but only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; wherefore, in that case there is less contempt, and therefore less <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> whereby "every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>," is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being committed, but something resulting from that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, viz. of the passion or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> inclining to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> One <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is added to another makes more <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but it does not always make a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> greater, since, perchance, the two <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not coincide, but are separate. It may happen, if the first diminishes the second, that the two together have not the same gravity as one of them alone would have; thus <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if committed by a man when sober, than if committed by a man when drunk, although in the latter case there are two <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: because drunkenness diminishes the sinfulness of the resulting <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more than its own gravity implies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The words of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> may be understood as referring to simply affected <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; or they may have reference to a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of ingratitude, the highest degree of which is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> even ignores the benefits he has received; or again, they may be an allusion to the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of unbelief, which undermines the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> edifice.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunken</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deserves a "double punishment" for the two <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he commits, viz. drunkenness, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which results from his drunkenness: and yet drunkenness, on account of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> connected therewith, diminishes the resulting <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and more, perhaps, than the gravity of the drunkenness implies, as stated above (ad 2). It might also be said that the words quoted refer to an ordinance of the legislator named Pittacus, who ordered drunkards to be more severely punished if they assaulted anyone; having an eye, not to the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> which the drunkard might claim, but to expediency, since more harm is done by the drunk than by the sober, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Polit. ii).
