<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the intellectual principle is united to the body as its form?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle is not united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 4) that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is "separate," and that it is not the act of any body. Therefore it is not united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every form is determined according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of which it is the form; otherwise no proportion would be required between <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Therefore if the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, since every body has a determinate <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it would follow that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has a determinate <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and thus, it would not be capable of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> all things, as is clear from what has been said (75, 2); which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever receptive power is an act of a body, receives a form materially and individually; for what is received must be received according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the receiver. But the form of the thing understood is not received into the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> materially and individually, but rather immaterially and universally: otherwise the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> would not be capable of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of immaterial and universal objects, but only of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, like the senses. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, power and action have the same subject; for the same subject is what can, and does, act. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> action is not the action of a body, as appears from above (Question 75, Article 2). Therefore neither is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> faculty a power of the body. But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or power cannot be more abstract or more simple than the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> from which the faculty or power is derived. Therefore neither is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> the form of a body.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, whatever has "per se" <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is not united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; because a form is that by which a thing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>: so that the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a form does not belong to the form by itself. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle has "per se" <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and is subsistent, as was said above (Question 75, Article 2). Therefore it is not united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, whatever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in a thing by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in it always. But to be united to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> belongs to the form by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; because form is the act of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, not by an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, but by its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; otherwise <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> would not make a thing substantially one, but only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> one. Therefore a form cannot be without its own proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle, since it is incorruptible, as was shown above (Question 75, Article 6), remains separate from the body, after the dissolution of the body. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle is not united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, Metaph. viii (Did. vii 2), difference is derived from the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But the difference which constitutes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is "rational," which is applied to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on account of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle is the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must assert that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation is the form of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. For that whereby primarily anything acts is a form of the thing to which the act is to be attributed: for instance, that whereby a body is primarily healed is health, and that whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> primarily is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; hence health is a form of the body, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a form of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The reason is because nothing acts except so far as it is in act; wherefore a thing acts by that whereby it is in act. Now it is clear that the first thing by which the body lives is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And as life appears through various operations in different degrees of living things, that whereby we primarily perform each of all these vital actions is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the primary principle of our nourishment, sensation, and local movement; and likewise of our understanding. Therefore this principle by which we primarily understand, whether it be called the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is the form of the body. This is the demonstration used by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Anima ii, 2).

<p>But if anyone says that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not the form of the body he must first explain how it is that this action of understanding is the action of this particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for each one is conscious that it is himself who understands. Now an action may be attributed to anyone in three ways, as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. v, 1); for a thing is said to move or act, either by virtue of its whole self, for instance, as a physician heals; or by virtue of a part, as a man sees by his eye; or through an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, as when we say that something that is white builds, because it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the builder to be white. So when we say that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> or <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> understands, it is clear that this is not attributed to him <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; since it is ascribed to him as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which is predicated of him <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. We must therefore say either that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> understands by virtue of his whole self, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> maintained, holding that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; or that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>. The first cannot stand, as was shown above (Question 75, Article 4), for this reason, that it is one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is conscious both that he understands, and that he senses. But one cannot sense without a body: therefore the body must be some part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. It follows therefore that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by which <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> understands is a part of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, so that in some way it is united to the body of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> held that this union is through the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as having a double subject, in the possible <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and in the phantasms which are in the corporeal organs. Thus through the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> the possible <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is linked to the body of this or that particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But this link or union does not sufficiently explain the fact, that the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the act of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>. This can be clearly seen from comparison with the sensitive faculty, from which <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> proceeds to consider things relating to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For the relation of phantasms to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is like the relation of colors to the sense of sight, as he says De Anima iii, 5,7. Therefore, as the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of colors are in the sight, so are the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of phantasms in the possible <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now it is clear that because the colors, the images of which are in the sight, are on a wall, the action of seeing is not attributed to the wall: for we do not say that the wall sees, but rather that it is seen. Therefore, from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of phantasms are in the possible <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, in whom are the phantasms, understands, but that he or his phantasms are understood.

<p>Some, however, tried to maintain that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is united to the body as its motor; and hence that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and body form one thing so that the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> could be attributed to the whole. This is, however, absurd for many reasons.

<p>First, because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not move the body except through the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, the movement of which presupposes the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. The reason therefore why <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> understands is not because he is moved by his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but rather, contrariwise, he is moved by his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> because he understands.

<p>Secondly, because since <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> be not the form, it follows that it must be outside the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and then the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the whole <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> as a motor to the thing moved. Whereas the act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> remains in the agent, and does not pass into something else, as does the action of heating. Therefore the action of understanding cannot be attributed to <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> for the reason that he is moved by his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>Thirdly, because the action of a motor is never attributed to the thing moved, except as to an instrument; as the action of a carpenter to a saw. Therefore if understanding is attributed to <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, as the action of what moves him, it follows that it is attributed to him as to an instrument. This is contrary to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, who holds that understanding is not possible through a corporeal instrument (De Anima iii, 4).

<p>Fourthly, because, although the action of a part be attributed to the whole, as the action of the eye is attributed to a man; yet it is never attributed to another part, except perhaps indirectly; for we do not say that the hand sees because the eye sees. Therefore if the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> are united in the above manner, the action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot be attributed to <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>. If, however, <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> be a whole composed of a union of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> with whatever else belongs to <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, and still the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> be united to those other things only as a motor, it follows that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> is not one absolutely, and consequently neither a being absolutely, for a thing is a being according as it is one.

<p>There remains, therefore, no other explanation than that given by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>--namely, that this particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> understands, because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle is his form. Thus from the very operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> it is made clear that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle is united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p>The same can be clearly shown from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of each thing is shown by its operation. Now the proper operation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to understand; because he thereby surpasses all other animals. Whence <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> concludes (Ethic. x, 7) that the ultimate <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> must consist in this operation as properly belonging to him. Man must therefore derive his <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from that which is the principle of this operation. But the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of anything is derived from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. It follows therefore that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle is the proper form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>But we must observe that the nobler a form is, the more it rises above corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the less it is merged in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and the more it excels <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by its power and its operation; hence we find that the form of a mixed body has another operation not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by its elemental <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>. And the higher we advance in the nobility of forms, the more we find that the power of the form excels the elementary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; as the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> excels the form of the metal, and the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> excels the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the highest and noblest of forms. Wherefore it excels corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in its power by the fact that it has an operation and a power in which corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> has no share whatever. This power is called the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>It is well to remark that if anyone holds that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, it would follow that in no way could the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be the form of the body. For since the form is an act, and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is only in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, that which is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> cannot be the form of another by virtue of itself as a whole. But if it is a form by virtue of some part of itself, then that part which is the form we call the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and that of which it is the form we call the "primary animate," as was said above (Question 75, Article 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii, 2), the ultimate <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form to which the consideration of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> philosopher is directed is indeed separate; yet it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. He proves this from the fact that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and the sun generate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>." It is separate indeed according to its <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power, because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power does not belong to a corporeal organ, as the power of seeing is the act of the eye; for understanding is an act which cannot be performed by a corporeal organ, like the act of seeing. But it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> so far as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, to which this power belongs, is the form of the body, and the term of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation. And so the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii) that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is separate, because it is not the faculty of a corporeal organ.

<p>From this it is clear how to answer the Second and Third objections: since, in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be able to understand all things by means of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and that his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> may understand immaterial things and universals, it is sufficient that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power be not the act of the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by reason of its perfection, is not a form merged in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or entirely embraced by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore there is nothing to prevent some power thereof not being the act of the body, although the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the form of the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> communicates that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in which it subsists to the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, out of which and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there results unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; so that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the whole composite is also the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This is not the case with other non-subsistent forms. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> retains its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> after the dissolution of the body; whereas it is not so with other forms.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> To be united to the body belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by reason of itself, as it belongs to a light body by reason of itself to be raised up. And as a light body remains light, when removed from its proper place, retaining meanwhile an aptitude and an inclination for its proper place; so the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> retains its proper <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> when separated from the body, having an aptitude and a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to be united to the body.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the intellectual principle is multiplied according to the number of bodies?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle is not multiplied according to the number of bodies, but that there is one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For an immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is not multiplied in number within one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is an immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; since it is not composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> as was shown above (Question 75, Article 5). Therefore there are not many <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore there is but one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, when the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is removed, the effect is also removed. Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were multiplied according to the number of bodies, it follows that the bodies being removed, the number of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> would not remain; but from all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> there would be but a single remainder. This is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>; for it would do away with the distinction of rewards and punishments.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if my <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is distinct from your <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, my <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and so is yours; for <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> are things which differ in number but agree in one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now whatever is received into anything must be received according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the receiver. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things would be received individually into my <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and also into yours: which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> universals.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the thing understood is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which understands. If, therefore, my <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is distinct from yours, what is understood by me must be distinct from what is understood by you; and consequently it will be reckoned as something <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and be only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> something understood; so that the common <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> will have to be abstracted from both; since from things diverse something intelligible common to them may be abstracted. But this is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; for then the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> would seem not to be distinct from the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. It seems, therefore, to follow that there is one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, when the disciple receives <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from the master, it cannot be said that the master's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> begets <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the disciple, because then also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> would be an active form, such as heat is, which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. It seems, therefore, that the same <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is in the master is communicated to the disciple; which cannot be, unless there is one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in both. Seemingly, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the disciple and master is but one; and, consequently, the same applies to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Quant. Animae xxxii) says: "If I were to say that there are many <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, I should laugh at myself." But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> seems to be one chiefly on account of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore there is one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii, 3) that the relation of universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to universals is like the relation of particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. But it is impossible that a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, one in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, should belong to animals of different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore it is impossible that one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should belong to several <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is absolutely impossible for one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to belong to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. This is clear if, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> maintained, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself. For it would follow that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> are one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and that they are not distinct from each other, except by something outside the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of each. The distinction between <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> would be no other than that of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with a <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a> and another with a cloak; which is quite absurd.

<p>It is likewise clear that this is impossible if, according to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Anima ii, 2), it is supposed that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a part or a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For it is impossible for many distinct <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> to have one form, as it is impossible for them to have one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, for the form is the principle of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<p>Again, this is clearly impossible, whatever one may hold as to the manner of the union of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to this or that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For it is manifest that, supposing there is one principal agent, and two instruments, we can say that there is one agent absolutely, but several actions; as when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> touches several things with his two hands, there will be one who touches, but two contacts. If, on the contrary, we suppose one instrument and several principal agents, we might say that there are several agents, but one act; for example, if there be many drawing a ship by means of a rope; there will be many drawing, but one pull. If, however, there is one principal agent, and one instrument, we say that there is one agent and one action, as when the smith strikes with one hammer, there is one striker and one stroke. Now it is clear that no matter how the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is united or coupled to this or that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has the precedence of all the other things which appertain to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for the sensitive powers obey the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and are at its service. Therefore, if we suppose two men to have several <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> and one sense--for instance, if two men had one eye--there would be several seers, but one sight. But if there is one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, no matter how diverse may be all those things of which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> makes use as instruments, in no way is it possible to say that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> are otherwise than one understanding <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And if to this we add that to understand, which is the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, is not affected by any organ other than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself; it will further follow that there is but one agent and one action: that is to say that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are but one "understander," and have but one act of understanding, in regard, that is, of one intelligible object.

<p>However, it would be possible to distinguish my <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> action form yours by the distinction of the phantasms--that is to say, were there one phantasm of a stone in me, and another in you--if the phantasm itself, as it is one thing in me and another in you, were a form of the possible <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; since the same agent according to divers forms produces divers actions; as, according to divers forms of things with regard to the same eye, there are divers visions. But the phantasm itself is not a form of the possible <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; it is the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> abstracted from the phantasm that is a form. Now in one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, from different phantasms of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, only one intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is abstracted; as appears in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in whom there may be different phantasms of a stone; yet from all of them only one intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a stone is abstracted; by which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by one operation, understands the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a stone, notwithstanding the diversity of phantasms. Therefore, if there were one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the diversity of phantasms which are in this one and that one would not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a diversity of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation in this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. It follows, therefore, that it is altogether impossible and unreasonable to maintain that there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, like an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, has no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from which it is produced, yet it is the form of a certain <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; in which it is unlike an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Therefore, according to the division of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, there are many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; while it is quite impossible for many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to be of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Everything has unity in the same way that it has being; consequently we must judge of the multiplicity of a thing as we judge of its being. Now it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by virtue of its very being, is united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; yet, after the dissolution of the body, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> retains its own being. In like manner the multiplicity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is in proportion to the multiplicity of the bodies; yet, after the dissolution of the bodies, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> retain their multiplied being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Individuality of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> being, or of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> whereby it understands, does not exclude the understanding of universals; otherwise, since separate <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> are subsistent <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, and consequently <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, they could not understand universals. But the materiality of the knower, and of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> whereby it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, impedes the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the universal. For as every action is according to the mode of the form by which the agent acts, as heating is according to the mode of the heat; so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is according to the mode of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by which the knower <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. Now it is clear that common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> becomes distinct and multiplied by reason of the individuating principles which come from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore if the form, which is the means of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, is material--that is, not abstracted from material <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>--its likeness to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or genus will be according to the distinction and multiplication of that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by means of individuating principles; so that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing in general will be impossible. But if the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> be abstracted from the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, there will be a likeness of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> without those things which make it distinct and multiplied; thus there will be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the universal. Nor does it matter, as to this particular point, whether there be one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or many; because, even if there were but one, it would <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> whereby it understands, an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Whether the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> be one or many, what is understood is one; for what is understood is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, not according to its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but according to its likeness; for "the stone is not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but its likeness is," as is said, De Anima iii, 8. Yet it is the stone which is understood, not the likeness of the stone; except by a reflection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> on itself: otherwise, the objects of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> would not be things, but only intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now it happens that different things, according to different forms, are likened to the same thing. And since <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is begotten according to the assimilation of the knower to the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, it follows that the same thing may happen to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by several knowers; as is apparent in regard to the senses; for several see the same color, according to different likenesses. In the same way several <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> understand one object understood. But there is this difference, according to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, between the sense and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>--that a thing is perceived by the sense according to the disposition which it has outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> --that is, in its <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a>; whereas the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing understood is indeed outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but the mode according to which it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not the mode according to which it is understood. For the common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is understood as apart from the individuating principles; whereas such is not its mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But, according to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, the thing understood <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> as those under which it is understood; for he supposed that the natures of things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> separate from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> One <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the disciple and another in the master. How it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> will be shown later on (117, 1).

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that besides the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there are in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> different from one another, such as the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the nutritive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For corruptible and incorruptible are not of the same <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is incorruptible; whereas the other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as the sensitive and the nutritive, are corruptible, as was shown above (Question 75, Article 6). Therefore in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the nutritive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, cannot be the same.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if it be said that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is incorruptible; on the contrary, "corruptible and incorruptible differ generically," says the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, Metaph. x (Did. ix, 10). But the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the horse, the lion, and other brute animals, is corruptible. If, therefore, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> it be incorruptible, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and brute animals will not be of the same "genus." Now an animal is so called from its having a sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and, therefore, "animal" will not be one genus common to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and other animals, which is absurd.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 2), that the genus is taken from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and difference from the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But "rational," which is the difference constituting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is taken from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; while he is called "animal" by reason of his having a body animated by a sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be compared to the body animated by a sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same as the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but presupposes it as a material subject.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in the book De Ecclesiasticis Dogmatibus xv: "Nor do we say that there are two <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as James and other Syrians write; one, animal, by which the body is animated, and which is mingled with the blood; the other, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, which obeys the reason; but we say that it is one and the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that both gives life to the body by being united to it, and orders itself by its own reasoning."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> held that there were several <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in one body, distinct even as to organs, to which <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> he referred the different vital actions, saying that the nutritive power is in the liver, the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> in the heart, and the power of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the brain. Which opinion is rejected by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Anima ii, 2), with regard to those parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which use corporeal organs; for this reason, that in those animals which continue to live when they have been divided in each part are observed the operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as sense and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now this would not be the case if the various principles of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> operations were <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> different, and distributed in the various parts of the body. But with regard to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part, he seems to leave it in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether it be "only <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>" distinct from the other parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, "or also locally."

<p>The opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> might be maintained if, as he held, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was supposed to be united to the body, not as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but as its motor. For it involves nothing unreasonable that the same movable thing be moved by several motors; and still less if it be moved according to its various parts. If we suppose, however, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, it is quite impossible for several <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> different <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to be in one body. This can be made clear by three different reasons.

<p>In the first place, an animal would not be absolutely one, in which there were several <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For nothing is absolutely one except by one form, by which a thing has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>: because a thing has from the same source both <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and unity; and therefore things which are denominated by various forms are not absolutely one; as, for instance, "a white <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were 'living' by one form, the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and 'animal' by another form, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" by another form, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it would follow that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not absolutely one. Thus <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> argues, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 6), against <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, that if the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an animal is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a biped, then a biped animal is not absolutely one. For this reason, against those who hold that there are several <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the body, he asks (De Anima i, 5), "what contains them?"--that is, what makes them one? It cannot be said that they are united by the one body; because rather does the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> contain the body and make it one, than the reverse.

<p>Secondly, this is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be impossible by the manner in which one thing is predicated of another. Those things which are derived from various forms are predicated of one another, either <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, (if the forms are not ordered to one another, as when we say that something white is sweet), or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, in the second manner of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> predication, (if the forms are ordered one to another, the subject belonging to the definition of the predicate; as a surface is presupposed to color; so that if we say that a body with a surface is colored, we have the second manner of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> predication.) Therefore, if we have one form by which a thing is an animal, and another form by which it is a man, it follows either that one of these two things could not be predicated of the other, except <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, supposing these two forms not to be ordered to one another--or that one would be predicated of the other according to the second manner of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> predication, if one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be presupposed to the other. But both of these consequences are clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: because "animal" is predicated of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> and not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not part of the definition of an animal, but the other way about. Therefore of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> by the same form a thing is animal and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; otherwise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not really be the thing which is an animal, so that animal can be <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> predicated of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>Thirdly, this is shown to be impossible by the fact that when one operation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is intense it impedes another, which could never be the case unless the principle of action were <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> one.

<p>We must therefore conclude that in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the nutritive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are numerically one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This can easily be explained, if we consider the differences of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and forms. For we observe that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and forms of things differ from one another, as the perfect and imperfect; as in the order of things, the animate are more perfect than the inanimate, and animals more perfect than plants, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than brute animals; and in each of these genera there are various degrees. For this reason <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 3), compares the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things to numbers, which differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by the addition or subtraction of unity. And (De Anima ii, 3) he compares the various <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of figures, one of which contains another; as a pentagon contains and exceeds a tetragon. Thus the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> contains virtually whatever belongs to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of brute animals, and to the nutritive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of plants. Therefore, as a surface which is of a pentagonal shape, is not tetragonal by one shape, and pentagonal by another--since a tetragonal shape would be superfluous as contained in the pentagonal--so neither is <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> a man by one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and animal by another; but by one and the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> he is both animal and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is incorruptible, not by reason of its being sensitive, but by reason of its being <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. When, therefore, a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sensitive only, it is corruptible; but when with sensibility it has also intellectuality, it is incorruptible. For although sensibility does not give incorruptibility, yet it cannot deprive intellectuality of its incorruptibility.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not forms, but composites, are classified either generically or specifically. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is corruptible like other animals. And so the difference of corruptible and incorruptible which is on the part of the forms does not involve a generic difference between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and the other animals.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The embryo has first of all a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is merely sensitive, and when this is removed, it is supplanted by a more perfect <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is both sensitive and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>: as will be shown further on (118, 2, ad 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> We must not consider the diversity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things as proceeding from the various <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> notions or intentions, which flow from our manner of understanding, because reason can apprehend one and the same thing in various ways. Therefore since, as we have said, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> contains virtually what belongs to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and something more, reason can consider separately what belongs to the power of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as something imperfect and material. And because it observes that this is something common to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and to other animals, it forms thence the notion of the "genus"; while that wherein the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> exceeds the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it takes as formal and perfecting; thence it gathers the "difference" of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether in man there is another form besides the intellectual soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is another form besides the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 1), that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the act of a physical body which has life <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to the body as a form of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But the body has a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form by which it is a body. Therefore some other <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form in the body precedes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> moves himself as every animal does. Now everything that moves itself is divided into two parts, of which one moves, and the other is moved, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. viii, 5). But the part which moves is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the other part must be such that it can be moved. But primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> cannot be moved (Phys. v, 1), since it is a being only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>; indeed everything that is moved is a body. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and in every animal there must be another <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, by which the body is constituted.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the order of forms depends on their relation to primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; for "before" and "after" apply by comparison to some beginning. Therefore if there were not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> some other <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form besides the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and if this were to inhere immediately to primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; it would follow that it ranks among the most imperfect forms which inhere to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> immediately.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is a mixed body. Now mingling does not result from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> alone; for then we should have mere corruption. Therefore the forms of the elements must remain in a mixed body; and these are <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body there are other <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms besides the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Of one thing there is but one <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being. But the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form gives <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being. Therefore of one thing there is but one <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore it is impossible for there to be in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> another <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form besides the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we suppose that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but only as its motor, as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> maintain, it would <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follow that in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is another <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, by which the body is established in its being as movable by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, as we have said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it is impossible for another <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form besides the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be found in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>In order to make this evident, we must consider that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form differs from the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form in this, that the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form does not make a thing to be "simply," but to be "such," as heat does not make a thing to be simply, but only to be hot. Therefore by the coming of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form a thing is not said to be made or generated simply, but to be made such, or to be in some particular <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>; and in like manner, when an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form is removed, a thing is said to be corrupted, not simply, but relatively. Now the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form gives being simply; therefore by its coming a thing is said to be generated simply; and by its removal to be corrupted simply. For this reason, the old <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who held that primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was some actual being--for instance, fire or air, or something of that sort--maintained that nothing is generated simply, or corrupted simply; and stated that "every becoming is nothing but an alteration," as we read, Phys. i, 4. Therefore, if besides the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there pre-existed in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> another <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form by which the subject of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were made an actual being, it would follow that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not give being simply; and consequently that it is not the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form: and so at the advent of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there would not be simple generation; nor at its removal simple corruption, all of which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p>Whence we must conclude, that there is no other <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> besides the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as it virtually contains the sensitive and nutritive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, so does it virtually contain all inferior forms, and itself alone does whatever the imperfect forms do in other things. The same is to be said of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in brute animals, and of the nutritive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in plants, and universally of all more perfect forms with regard to the imperfect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> does not say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the act of a body only, but "the act of a physical organic body which has life <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>"; and that this <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> "does not reject the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Whence it is clear that when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is called the act, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself is included; as when we say that heat is the act of what is hot, and light of what is lucid; not as though lucid and light were two separate things, but because a thing is made lucid by the light. In like manner, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is said to be the "act of a body," etc., because by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> it is a body, and is organic, and has life <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. Yet the first act is said to be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to the second act, which is operation; for such a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> "does not reject"--that is, does not exclude--the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not move the body by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as the form of the body, but by the motive power, the act of which presupposes the body to be already actualized by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: so that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by its motive power is the part which moves; and the animate body is the part moved.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> We observe in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> various degrees of perfection, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, living, sensing, and understanding. Now what is added is always more perfect. Therefore that form which gives <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> only the first degree of perfection is the most imperfect; while that form which gives the first, second, and third degree, and so on, is the most perfect: and yet it inheres to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> immediately.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> held that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms of the elements remain entire in the mixed body; and that the mixture is made by the contrary <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the elements being reduced to an average. But this is impossible, because the various forms of the elements must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be in various parts of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; for the distinction of which we must suppose dimensions, without which <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> cannot be divisible. Now <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> subject to dimension is not to be found except in a body. But various bodies cannot be in the same place. Whence it follows that elements in the mixed body would be distinct as to situation. And then there would not be a real mixture which is in respect of the whole; but only a mixture apparent to sense, by the juxtaposition of particles.

<p><a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a> maintained that the forms of elements, by reason of their imperfection, are a medium between <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> and <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms, and so can be "more" or "less"; and therefore in the mixture they are modified and reduced to an average, so that one form emerges from them. But this is even still more impossible. For the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being of each thing consists in something indivisible, and every addition and subtraction varies the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as in numbers, as stated in Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 3); and consequently it is impossible for any <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form to receive "more" or "less." Nor is it less impossible for anything to be a medium between <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>.

<p>Therefore we must say, in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Gener. i, 10), that the forms of the elements remain in the mixed body, not actually but virtually. For the proper <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the elements remain, though modified; and in them is the power of the elementary forms. This <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the mixture is the proper disposition for the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the mixed body; for instance, the form of a stone, or of any sort of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the intellectual soul is properly united to such a body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is improperly united to such a body. For <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> must be proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is incorruptible. Therefore it is not properly united to a corruptible body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a perfectly immaterial form; a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> whereof is its operation in which corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not share. But the more subtle is the body, the less has it of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should be united to a most subtle body, to fire, for instance, and not to a mixed body, still less to a terrestrial body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since the form is the principle of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, one form cannot produce a variety of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is one form. Therefore, it should not be united to a body which is composed of parts belonging to various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, what is susceptible of a more perfect form should itself be more perfect. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the most perfect of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Therefore since the bodies of other animals are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> provided with a covering, for instance, with hair instead of clothes, and hoofs instead of shoes; and are, moreover, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> provided with arms, as claws, teeth, and horns; it seems that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should not have been united to a body which is imperfect as being deprived of the above means of protection.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 1), that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the act of a physical organic body having life <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the form is not for the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but rather the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for the form, we must gather from the form the reason why the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is such as it is; and not conversely. Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as we have seen above (Question 55, Article 2) in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, holds the lowest place among <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; inasmuch as it is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> gifted with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are; but has to gather <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> things by way of the senses, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii). But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> never fails in <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things: therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had to be endowed not only with the power of understanding, but also with the power of feeling. Now the action of the senses is not performed without a corporeal instrument. Therefore it behooved the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be united to a body fitted to be a convenient organ of sense.

<p>Now all the other senses are based on the sense of touch. But the organ of touch requires to be a medium between contraries, such as hot and cold, wet and dry, and the like, of which the sense of touch has the perception; thus it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> with regard to contraries, and is able to perceive them. Therefore the more the organ of touch is reduced to an equable complexion, the more sensitive will be the touch. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has the power of sense in all its completeness; because what belongs to the inferior <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> more perfectly in the superior, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. v). Therefore the body to which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united should be a mixed body, above others reduced to the most equable complexion. For this reason among animals, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the best sense of touch. And among men, those who have the best sense of touch have the best <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>. A sign of which is that we observe "those who are refined in body are well endowed in mind," as stated in De Anima ii, 9.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Perhaps someone might attempt to answer this by saying that before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was incorruptible. This answer does not seem sufficient; because before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>; otherwise its <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> would not be forfeited through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as neither was the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.

<p>Therefore we answer otherwise by observing that in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> two <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are to be found; one which is chosen in order that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> be suitable to the form; the other which follows by force of the first disposition. The artisan, for instance, for the form of the saw chooses iron adapted for cutting through hard material; but that the teeth of the saw may become blunt and rusted, follows by force of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> itself. So the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> requires a body of equable complexion, which, however, is corruptible by force of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. If, however, it be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could avoid this, we answer that in the formation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things we do not consider what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> might do; but what is suitable to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 1). <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, provided in this case by applying a remedy against death in the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A body is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by reason of its <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation considered as such; but on account of the sensitive power, which requires an organ of equable temperament. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had to be united to such a body, and not to a simple element, or to a mixed body, in which fire was in excess; because otherwise there could not be an equability of temperament. And this body of an equable temperament has a dignity of its own by reason of its being remote from contraries, thereby resembling in a way a heavenly body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The parts of an animal, for instance, the eye, hand, flesh, and bones, and so forth, do not make the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; but the whole does, and therefore, properly speaking, we cannot say that these are of different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but that they are of various dispositions. This is suitable to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which, although it be one in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, yet on account of its perfection, is manifold in power: and therefore, for its various operations it requires various dispositions in the parts of the body to which it is united. For this reason we observe that there is a greater variety of parts in perfect than in imperfect animals; and in these a greater variety than in plants.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as comprehending universals, has a power extending to the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; therefore it cannot be limited by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to certain fixed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> notions, or even to certain fixed means whether of defence or of clothing, as is the case with other animals, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of which are endowed with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and power in regard to fixed particular things. Instead of all these, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and his hands, which are "the organs of organs" (De Anima iii), since by their means <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can make for himself instruments of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> variety, and for any number of purposes.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the intellectual soul is united to the body through the medium of accidental dispositions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body through the medium of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> dispositions. For every form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in its proper disposed <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But dispositions to a form are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. Therefore we must presuppose <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> to be in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> before the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form; and therefore before the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, various forms of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> require various parts of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But various parts of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are unintelligible without division in measurable <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantities</a>. Therefore we must suppose dimensions in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> before the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms, which are many belonging to one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> is connected with what is corporeal by virtual contact. But the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is its power. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body by means of a power, which is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Accident is posterior to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, both in the order of time and in the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says, Metaph. vii (Did. vi, 1). Therefore it is unintelligible that any <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> before the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were united to the body, merely as a motor, there would be nothing to prevent the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of certain dispositions mediating between the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the body; on the contrary, they would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would be required the power to move the body; and on the part of the body, a certain aptitude to be moved by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>If, however, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body as the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, as we have already said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it is impossible for any <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> disposition to come between the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or between any <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form whatever and its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. The reason is because since <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to all manner of acts in a certain order, what is absolutely first among the acts must be understood as being first in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now the first among all acts is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Therefore, it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to be apprehended as hot, or as having <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, before it is actual. But <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> has actual <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, which makes it to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> absolutely, as we have said above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Wherefore it is impossible for any <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> dispositions to pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> before the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, and consequently before the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As appears from what has been already said (4), the more perfect form virtually contains whatever belongs to the inferior forms; therefore while remaining one and the same, it perfects <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> according to the various degrees of perfection. For the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> form makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> an actual being, a body, a living being, an animal, and a man. Now it is clear that to every "genus" follow its own proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. Therefore as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is apprehended as perfected in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, before it is understood as corporeal, and so on; so those <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> which belong to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> are understood to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> before corporeity; and thus dispositions are understood in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> before the form, not as regards all its effects, but as regards the subsequent effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Dimensions of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> consequent to the corporeity which belongs to the whole <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, once understood as corporeal and measurable, can be understood as distinct in its various parts, and as receptive of different forms according to the further degrees of perfection. For although it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same form which gives <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> the various degrees of perfection, as we have said (ad 1), yet it is considered as different when brought under the observation of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> which is united to a body as its motor only, is united thereto by power or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united by its very being to the body as a form; and yet it guides and moves the body by its power and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the soul is united to the animal body by means of a body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the animal body by means of a body. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. vii, 19), that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> administers the body by light," that is, by fire, "and by air, which is most akin to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>." But fire and air are bodies. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body by means of a body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a link between two things seems to be that thing the removal of which involves the cessation of their union. But when breathing ceases, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is separated from the body. Therefore the breath, which is a subtle body, is the means of union between <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things which are very distant from one another, are not united except by something between them. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is very distant from the body, both because it is incorporeal, and because it is incorruptible. Therefore it seems to be united to the body by means of an incorruptible body, and such would be some heavenly light, which would harmonize the elements, and unite them together.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 1): "We need not ask if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body are one, as neither do we ask if wax and its shape are one." But the shape is united to the wax without a body intervening. Therefore also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is thus united to the body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, were united to the body merely as a motor, it would be right to say that some other bodies must intervene between the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or any animal whatever; for a motor <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> moves what is distant from it by means of something nearer.

<p>If, however, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, as we have said (1), it is impossible for it to be united by means of another body. The reason of this is that a thing is one, according as it is a being. Now the form, through itself, makes a thing to be actual since it is itself <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> an act; nor does it give <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by means of something else. Wherefore the unity of a thing composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, is by virtue of the form itself, which by reason of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as its act. Nor is there any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of union except the agent, which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to be in act, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 6).

<p>From this it is clear how <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> are the opinions of those who maintained the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of some mediate bodies between the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Of these certain <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> said that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has an incorruptible body <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> united to it, from which it is never separated, and by means of which it is united to the corruptible body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Others said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body by means of a corporeal spirit. Others said it is united to the body by means of light, which, they say, is a body and of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the fifth <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; so that the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would be united to the body by means of the light of the sidereal <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; the sensible <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by means of the light of the crystal <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by means of the light of the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Now all this is fictious and ridiculous: for light is not a body; and the fifth <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> does not enter materially into the composition of a mixed body (since it is unchangeable), but only virtually: and lastly, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is immediately united to the body as the form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks there of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as it moves the body; whence he uses the word "administration." It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that it moves the grosser parts of the body by the more subtle parts. And the first instrument of the motive power is a kind of spirit, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in De causa motus animalium (De mot. animal. x).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body ceases at the cessation of breath, not because this is the means of union, but because of the removal of that disposition by which the body is disposed for such a union. Nevertheless the breath is a means of moving, as the first instrument of motion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is indeed very distant from the body, if we consider the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of each separately: so that if each had a separate <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, many means of connection would have to intervene. But inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the form of the body, it has not an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> apart from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the body, but by its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is united to the body immediately. This is the case with every form which, if considered as an act, is very distant from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is a being only in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the soul is in each part of the body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not in each part of the body; for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in De causa motus animalium (De mot. animal. x): "It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be in each part of the body; it suffices that it be in some principle of the body <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> the other parts to live, for each part has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement of its own."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in the body of which it is the act. But it is the act of an organic body. Therefore it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> only in an organic body. But each part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is not an organic body. Therefore the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not in each part.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima. ii, 1) that the relation of a part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to a part of the body, such as the sight to the pupil of the eye, is the same as the relation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the whole body of an animal. If, therefore, the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in each part of the body, it follows that each part of the body is an animal.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are rooted in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. If, therefore, the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be in each part of the body, it follows that all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are in each part of the body; thus the sight will be in the ear, and hearing in the eye, and this is absurd.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in each part of the body, each part of the body is immediately dependent on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Thus one part would not depend on another; nor would one part be nobler than another; which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not in each part of the body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 6), that "in each body the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in the whole body, and in each part is entire."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have said, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were united to the body merely as its motor, we might say that it is not in each part of the body, but only in one part through which it would move the others. But since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, it must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be in the whole body, and in each part thereof. For it is not an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form, but the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the body. Now the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form perfects not only the whole, but each part of the whole. For since a whole consists of parts, a form of the whole which does not give <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to each of the parts of the body, is a form consisting in composition and order, such as the form of a house; and such a form is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form; and therefore it must be the form and the act, not only of the whole, but also of each part. Therefore, on the withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as we do not speak of an animal or a man unless equivocally, as we speak of a painted animal or a stone animal; so is it with the hand, the eye, the flesh and bones, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 1). A <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which is, that on the withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, no part of the body retains its proper action; although that which retains its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, retains the action of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But act is in that which it actuates: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must be in the whole body, and in each part thereof.

<p>That it is entire in each part thereof, may be concluded from this, that since a whole is that which is divided into parts, there are three kinds of totality, corresponding to three kinds of division. There is a whole which is divided into parts of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as a whole line, or a whole body. There is also a whole which is divided into <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> parts: as a thing defined is divided into the parts of a definition, and a composite into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. There is, further, a third kind of whole which is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a>, divided into virtual parts. The first kind of totality does not apply to forms, except perhaps <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; and then only to those forms, which have an indifferent relationship to a <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantitative</a> whole and its parts; as whiteness, as far as its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is concerned, is equally disposed to be in the whole surface and in each part of the surface; and, therefore, the surface being divided, the whiteness is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> divided. But a form which requires variety in the parts, such as a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and specially the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of perfect animals, is not equally related to the whole and the parts: hence it is not divided <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> when the whole is divided. So therefore <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantitative</a> totality cannot be attributed to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, either <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. But the second kind of totality, which depends on <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> perfection, properly and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> belongs to forms: and likewise the virtual totality, because a form is the principle of operation.

<p>Therefore if it be asked whether the whole whiteness is in the whole surface and in each part thereof, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to distinguish. If we mean <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantitative</a> totality which whiteness has <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, then the whole whiteness is not in each part of the surface. The same is to be said of totality of power: since the whiteness which is in the whole surface moves the sight more than the whiteness which is in a small part thereof. But if we mean totality of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, then the whole whiteness is in each part of a surface.

<p>Since, however, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has not <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantitative</a> totality, neither <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as we have seen; it is enough to say that the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in each part of the body, by totality of perfection and of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but not by totality of power. For it is not in each part of the body, with regard to each of its powers; but with regard to sight, it is in the eye; and with regard to hearing, it is in the ear; and so forth. We must observe, however, that since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> requires variety of parts, its relation to the whole is not the same as its relation to the parts; for to the whole it is compared primarily and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, as to its proper and proportionate perfectible; but to the parts, secondarily, inasmuch as they are ordained to the whole.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking there of the motive power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the act of an organic body, as of its primary and proportionate perfectible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An animal is that which is composed of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and a whole body, which is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> primary and proportionate perfectible. Thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not in a part. Whence it does not follow that a part of an animal is an animal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Some of the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are in it according as it exceeds the entire capacity of the body, namely the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; whence these powers are not said to be in any part of the body. Other powers are common to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; wherefore each of these powers need not be wherever the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is, but only in that part of the body, which is adapted to the operation of such a power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> One part of the body is said to be nobler than another, on account of the various powers, of which the parts of the body are the organs. For that part which is the organ of a nobler power, is a nobler part of the body: as also is that part which serves the same power in a nobler manner.
