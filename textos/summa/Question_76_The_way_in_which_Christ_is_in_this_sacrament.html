<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the whole Christ is contained under this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not contained under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> begins to be in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by conversion of the bread and wine. But it is evident that the bread and wine cannot be changed either into the Godhead or into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in three <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, namely, the Godhead, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, as shown above (2, 5; 5, 1,3), it seems that the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, forasmuch as it is ordained to the refection of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, which consists in food and drink, as stated above (Question 74, Article 1). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse56">John 6:56</a>): "My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed." Therefore, only the flesh and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are contained in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But there are many other parts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, for instance, the nerves, bones, and such like. Therefore the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not contained under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a body of greater <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> cannot be contained under the measure of a lesser. But the measure of the bread and wine is much smaller than the measure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body. Therefore it is impossible that the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be contained under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Officiis): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to confess according to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Yet we must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is something of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in a twofold manner: first, as it were, by the power of the sacrament; secondly, from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> concomitance. By the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, there is under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that into which the pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine is changed, as expressed by the words of the form, which are effective in this as in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; for instance, by the words: "This is My body," or, "This is My blood." But from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> concomitance there is also in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that which is really united with that thing wherein the aforesaid conversion is terminated. For if any two things be really united, then wherever the one is really, there must the other also be: since things really united together are only distinguished by an operation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Because the change of the bread and wine is not terminated at the Godhead or the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it follows as a consequence that the Godhead or the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> not by the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but from real concomitance. For since the Godhead never set aside the assumed body, wherever the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is, there, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, must the Godhead be; and therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the Godhead to be in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> concomitantly with His body. Hence we read in the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at Ephesus (P. I., chap. xxvi): "We are made partakers of the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not as taking common flesh, nor as of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> united to the Word in dignity, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> life-giving flesh of the Word Himself."

<p>On the other hand, His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> separated from His body, as stated above (Question 50, Article 5). And therefore had this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> been celebrated during those three days when He was dead, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would not have been there, neither by the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, nor from real concomitance. But since "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rising from the dead dieth now no more" (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse9">Romans 6:9</a>), His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is always really united with His body. And therefore in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the body indeed of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is present by the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from real concomitance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By the power of the sacrament there is contained under it, as to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the bread, not only the flesh, but the entire body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, the bones the nerves, and the like. And this is apparent from the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, wherein it is not said: "This is My flesh," but "This is My body." Accordingly, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse56">John 6:56</a>): "My flesh is meat indeed," there the word flesh is put for the entire body, because according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> custom it seems to be more adapted for eating, as men commonly are fed on the flesh of animals, but not on the bones or the like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As has been already stated (75, 5), after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or of the wine into His blood, the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of both remain. From which it is evident that the dimensions of the bread or wine are not changed into the dimensions of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> into <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. And so the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body or blood is under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but not the dimensions of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body or blood. Hence it is clear that the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> "by way of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," and not by way of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But the proper totality of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is contained indifferently in a small or large <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; as the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of air in a great or small amount of air, and the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a man in a big or small <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Wherefore, after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and blood is contained in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, just as the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine was contained there before the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the whole Christ is contained under each species of this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not contained under both <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is ordained for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, not by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but by virtue of what is contained under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> were there even before the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, from which comes the power of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. If nothing, then, be contained under one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but what is contained under the other, and if the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be contained under both, it seems that one of them is superfluous in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it was stated above (1, ad 1) that all the other parts of the body, such as the bones, nerves, and the like, are comprised under the name of flesh. But the blood is one of the parts of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> proves (De Anima Histor. i). If, then, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood be contained under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of bread, just as the other parts of the body are contained there, the blood ought not to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> apart, just as no other part of the body is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> separately.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is once "in being" cannot be again "in becoming." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body has already begun to be in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread. Therefore, it cannot begin again to be there by the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the wine; and so <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body will not be contained under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the wine, and accordingly neither the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not contained under each <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse25">1 Corinthians 11:25</a>, commenting on the word "Chalice," says that "under each <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>," namely, of the bread and wine, "the same is received"; and thus it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is entire under each <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> After what we have said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it must be held most certainly that the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is under each sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> yet not alike in each. For the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is indeed present under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of bread by the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, while the blood is there from real concomitance, as stated above (1, ad 1) in regard to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and Godhead of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; and under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of wine the blood is present by the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and His body by real concomitance, as is also His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and Godhead: because now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood is not separated from His body, as it was at the time of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and death. Hence if this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> had been celebrated then, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would have been under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the bread, but without the blood; and, under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the wine, the blood would have been present without the body, as it was then, in fact.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is under each <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, yet it is so not without purpose. For in the first place this serves to represent <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, in which the blood was separated from the body; hence in the form for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the blood mention is made of its shedding. Secondly, it is in keeping with the use of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body be shown apart to the faithful as food, and the blood as drink. Thirdly, it is in keeping with its effect, in which sense it was stated above (Question 74, Article 1) that "the body is offered for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the body, and the blood for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, of which this is the memorial, the other parts of the body were not separated from one another, as the blood was, but the body remained entire, according to <a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse46">Exodus 12:46</a>: "You shall not break a bone thereof." And therefore in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the blood is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> apart from the body, but no other part is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> separately from the rest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of wine by the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but by real concomitance: and therefore by the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the wine the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not there of itself, but concomitantly.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ is entire under every part of the species of the bread and wine?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not entire under every part of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of bread and wine. Because those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> can be divided <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>. If therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be entirely under every part of the said <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it would follow that He is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of times: which is unreasonable; because the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is repugnant not only to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but likewise to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> is an organic body, it has parts determinately distant. for a determinate distance of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> parts from each other is of the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an organic body, as that of eye from eye, and eye from ear. But this could not be so, if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were entire under every part of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; for every part would have to be under every other part, and so where one part would be, there another part would be. It cannot be then that the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is under every part of the host or of the wine contained in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body always retains the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a body, nor is it ever changed into a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>. Now it is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a body for it to be "<a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> having position" (Predic. iv). But it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> that the various parts <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in various parts of place. Therefore, apparently it is impossible for the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be under every part of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon (<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, Sacramentarium): "Each receives <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the Lord, Who is entire under every morsel, nor is He less in each portion, but bestows Himself entire under each."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was observed above (1, ad 3), because the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, while dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is there by reason of real concomitance, consequently <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> substantively, that is, in the way in which <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is under dimensions, but not after the manner of dimensions, which means, not in the way in which the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of a body is under the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of place.

<p>Now it is evident that the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is under every part of the dimensions under which it is contained; just as the entire <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of air is under every part of air, and the entire <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of bread under every part of bread; and this indifferently, whether the dimensions be actually divided (as when the air is divided or the bread cut), or whether they be actually undivided, but <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> divisible. And therefore it is manifest that the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is under every part of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the bread, even while the host remains entire, and not merely when it is broken, as some say, giving the example of an image which appears in a mirror, which appears as one in the unbroken mirror, whereas when the mirror is broken, there is an image in each part of the broken mirror: for the comparison is not perfect, because the multiplying of such images results in the broken mirror on account of the various reflections in the various parts of the mirror; but here there is only one <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Number follows division, and therefore so long as <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> remains actually undivided, neither is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of any thing several times under its proper dimensions, nor is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body several times under the dimensions of the bread; and consequently not an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of times, but just as many times as it is divided into parts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The determinate distance of parts in an organic body is based upon its dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> precedes even dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. And since the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread is terminated at the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and since according to the manner of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is properly and directly in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; such distance of parts is indeed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body, which, however, is not compared to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> according to such distance, but according to the manner of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as stated above (1, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument is based on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a body, arising from dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But it was said above (ad 2) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is compared with this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> not by reason of dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but by reason of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as already stated.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the whole dimensive quantity of Christ's body is in this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the whole dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For it was said (3) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> entire body is contained under every part of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> host. But no dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is contained entirely in any whole, and in its every part. Therefore it is impossible for the entire dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body to be there.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is impossible for two dimensive quantities to be together, even though one be separate from its subject, and the other in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body, as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. iii). But the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the bread remains in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as is evident to our senses. Consequently, the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not there.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if two unequal dimensive quantities be set side by side, the greater will overlap the lesser. But the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is considerably larger than the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> host according to every dimension. Therefore, if the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body be in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> together with the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the host, the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is extended beyond the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the host, which nevertheless is not without the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body. Therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body will be in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> even outside the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the bread, which is unreasonable, since the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, only by the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Consequently, it is impossible for the whole dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body to be in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of any body cannot be separated from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. But in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the entire <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is present, as stated above (1,3). Therefore the entire dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), any part of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in two ways: in one way, by the power of the sacrament; in another, from real concomitance. By the power of the sacrament the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; for, by the power of the sacrament that is present in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, whereat the conversion is terminated. But the conversion which takes place in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is terminated directly at the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, and not at its dimensions; which is evident from the fact that the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the bread remains after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, while only the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread passes away.

<p>Nevertheless, since the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not really deprived of its dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> and its other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, hence it comes that by reason of real concomitance the whole dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and all its other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The manner of being of every thing is determined by what belongs to it of itself, and not according to what is coupled <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> with it: thus an object is present to the sight, according as it is white, and not according as it is sweet, although the same object may be both white and sweet; hence sweetness is in the sight after the manner of whiteness, and not after that of sweetness. Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is present on the altar by the power of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, while its dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is there concomitantly and as it were <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, therefore the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not according to its proper manner (namely, that the whole is in the whole, and the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> parts in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> parts), but after the manner of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is for the whole to be in the whole, and the whole in every part.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Two dimensive quantities cannot <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> be in the same subject at the same time, so that each be there according to the proper manner of dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the bread is there after its proper manner, that is, according to commensuration: not so the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, for that is there after the manner of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as stated above (ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> not by way of commensuration, which is proper to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, and to which it belongs for the greater to be extended beyond the lesser; but in the way mentioned above (ad 1,2).

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether Christ's body is in this sacrament as in a place?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as in a place. Because, to be in a place definitively or circumscriptively belongs to being in a place. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body seems to be definitively in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because it is so present where the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the bread and wine are, that it is nowhere else upon the altar: likewise it seems to be there circumscriptively, because it is so contained under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> host, that it neither exceeds it nor is exceeded by it. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as in a place.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the place of the bread and wine is not empty, because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> abhors a vacuum; nor is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread there, as stated above (Question 75, Article 2); but only the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is there. Consequently the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> fills that place. But whatever fills a place is there locally. Therefore the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> locally.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> with its dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, and with all its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. But to be in a place is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> of a body; hence "where" is numbered among the nine kinds of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> locally.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The place and the object placed must be equal, as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iv). But the place, where this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is, is much less than the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as in a place.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 3; 3), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> not after the proper manner of dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but rather after the manner of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. But every body occupying a place is in the place according to the manner of dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, namely, inasmuch as it is commensurate with the place according to its dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Hence it remains that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as in a place, but after the manner of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, that is to say, in that way in which <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is contained by dimensions; because the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body succeeds the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: hence as the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread was not locally under its dimensions, but after the manner of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, so neither is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not the subject of those dimensions, as was the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread: and therefore the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread was there locally by reason of its dimensions, because it was compared with that place through the medium of its own dimensions; but the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is compared with that place through the medium of foreign dimensions, so that, on the contrary, the proper dimensions of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body are compared with that place through the medium of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; which is contrary to the notion of a located body.

<p>Hence in no way is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body locally in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> definitively, because then it would be only on the particular altar where this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is performed: whereas it is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> under its own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and on many other altars under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Likewise it is evident that it is not in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> circumscriptively, because it is not there according to the commensuration of its own <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as stated above. But that it is not outside the superficies of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, nor on any other part of the altar, is due not to its being there definitively or circumscriptively, but to its being there by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> and conversion of the bread and wine, as stated above (1; 15, 2, sqq.).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The place in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is, is not empty; nor yet is it properly filled with the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, which is not there locally, as stated above; but it is filled with the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which have to fill the place either because of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of dimensions, or at least <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>, as they also subsist <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> after the fashion of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body are in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by real concomitance. And therefore those <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body which are intrinsic to it are in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But to be in a place is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> when compared with the extrinsic container. And therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as in a place.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether Christ's body is in this sacrament movably?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is movably in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Topic. ii) that "when we are moved, the things within us are moved": and this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> even of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. "But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>," as shown above (74, 1). Therefore He is moved when it is moved.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ought to correspond with the figure. But, according to the commandment (<a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse10">Exodus 12:10</a>), concerning the Paschal Lamb, a figure of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, "there remained nothing until the morning." Neither, therefore, if this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> be reserved until morning, will <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body be there; and so it is not immovably in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body were to remain under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> even until the morrow, for the same reason it will remain there during all coming time; for it cannot be said that it ceases to be there when the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> pass, because the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not dependent on those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> for all coming time. It seems, then, that straightway on the morrow, or after a short time, He ceases to be under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And so it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> movably.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> it is impossible for the same thing to be in motion and at rest, else contradictories would be verified of the same subject. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is at rest in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore it is not movably in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When any thing is one, as to subject, and manifold in being, there is nothing to hinder it from being moved in one respect, and yet to remain at rest in another just as it is one thing for a body to be white, and another thing, to be large; hence it can be moved as to its whiteness, and yet continue unmoved as to its magnitude. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, being in Himself and being under the sacrament are not the same thing, because when we say that He is under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, we express a kind of relationship to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. According to this being, then, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not moved locally of Himself, but only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as in a place, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). But what is not in a place, is not moved of itself locally, but only according to the motion of the subject in which it is.

<p>In the same way neither is it moved of itself according to the being which it has in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, by any other change whatever, as for instance, that it ceases to be under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: because whatever possesses unfailing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of itself, cannot be the principle of failing; but when something else fails, then it ceases to be in it; just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is unfailing and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, ceases to be in some corruptible creature because such corruptible creature ceases to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. And in this way, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has unfailing and incorruptible being, He ceases to be under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not because He ceases to be, nor yet by local movement of His own, as is clear from what has been said, but only by the fact that the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cease to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p>Hence it is clear that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, strictly speaking is immovably in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument deals with <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> movement, whereby things within us are moved together with us. But with things which can of themselves be in a place, like bodies, it is otherwise than with things which cannot of themselves be in a place, such as forms and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. And to this mode can be reduced what we say of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, being moved <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> which He has in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, in which He is not present as in a place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It was this argument which seems to have convinced those who held that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body does not remain under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> if it be reserved until the morrow. It is against these that Cyril says (Ep. lxxxiii): "Some are so foolish as to say that the mystical <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> departs from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, if any of its fragments remain until the next day: for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> body is not changed, and the power of the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, and the life-giving <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is perpetually in it." Thus are all other consecrations irremovable so long as the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> things endure; on which account they are not repeated. And although the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> corresponds with the figure, still the figure cannot equal it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> remains in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> not only until the morrow, but also in the future, so long as the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> remain: and when they cease, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body ceases to be under them, not because it depends on them, but because the relationship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body to those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is taken away, in the same way as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ceases to be the Lord of a creature which ceases to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the body of Christ, as it is in this sacrament, can be seen by any eye, at least by a glorified one?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as it is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, can be seen by the eye, at least by a glorified one. For our eyes are hindered from beholding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, on account of the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> veiling it. But the glorified eye cannot be hindered by anything from seeing bodies as they are. Therefore, the glorified eye can see <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body as it is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the glorified bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be "made like to the body" of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> "<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>," according to <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> eye beholds Himself as He is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore, for the same reason, every other glorified eye can see Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse36">Luke 20:36</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> see the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as it is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, for even the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> are found to pay reverence thereto, and to fear it. Therefore, for like reason, the glorified eye can see <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as He is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As long as a thing remains the same, it cannot at the same time be seen by the same eye under diverse <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the glorified eye sees <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> always, as He is in His own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa033.htm#verse17">Isaiah 33:17</a>: "(His eyes) shall see the king in his beauty." It seems, then, that it does not see <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as He is under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The eye is of two kinds, namely, the bodily eye properly so-called, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> eye, so-called by similitude. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body as it is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> cannot be seen by any bodily eye. First of all, because a body which is visible brings about an alteration in the medium, through its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body are in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by means of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; so that the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body have no immediate relationship either to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> or to adjacent bodies; consequently they do not act on the medium so as to be seen by any corporeal eye. Secondly, because, as stated above (1, ad 3; 3), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is substantially present in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as such, is not visible to the bodily eye, nor does it come under any one of the senses, nor under the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, but solely under the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whose object is "what a thing is" (De Anima iii). And therefore, properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, according to the mode of being which it has in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, is perceptible neither by the sense nor by the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, but only by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is called the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eye.

<p>Moreover it is perceived differently by different <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>. For since the way in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is entirely <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, it is visible in itself to a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, i.e. the Divine, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and consequently to a beatified <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which, through the participated <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, sees all <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> things in the vision of the Divine Essence. But it can be seen by a wayfarer through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, like other <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> things. And not even the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power is capable of beholding it; consequently the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> cannot by their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> perceive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, except through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to which they do not pay willing assent; yet they are convinced of it from the evidence of signs, according to <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse19">James 2:19</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and tremble."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Our bodily eye, on account of the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is hindered from beholding the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> underlying them, not merely as by way of veil (just as we are hindered from seeing what is covered with any corporeal veil), but also because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body bears a relation to the medium surrounding this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not through its own <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, but through the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own bodily eye sees Himself <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> under the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, yet it cannot see the way in which it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> under the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because that belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But it is not the same with any other glorified eye, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> eye is under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, in which no other glorified eye is conformed to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad, can see anything with a bodily eye, but only with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> eye. Hence there is no parallel reason, as is evident from what was said above.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether Christ's body is truly there when flesh or a child appears miraculously in this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> there when flesh or a child appears <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Because His body ceases to be under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> when the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cease to be present, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>). But when flesh or a child appears, the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cease to be present. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> there.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, wherever <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is, it is there either under its own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, or under those of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But when such apparitions occur, it is evident that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not present under His own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, because the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is contained in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and He remains entire under the form in which He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended to heaven</a>: yet what appears <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is sometimes seen as a small particle of flesh, or at times as a small child. Now it is evident that He is not there under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which is that of bread or wine. Consequently, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not there in any way.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body begins to be in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> and conversion, as was said above (75, 2,3,4). But the flesh and blood which appear by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> are not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, nor are they converted into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body and blood. Therefore the body or the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not under those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> When such apparition takes place, the same reverence is shown to it as was shown at first, which would not be done if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> there, to Whom we show reverence of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." Therefore, when such apparition occurs, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is under the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Such apparition comes about in two ways, when occasionally in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> flesh, or blood, or a child, is seen. Sometimes it happens on the part of the beholders, whose eyes are so affected as if they outwardly saw flesh, or blood, or a child, while no change takes place in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And this seems to happen when to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> it is seen under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of flesh or of a child, while to others it is seen as before under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of bread; or when to the same <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> it appears for an hour under the appearance of flesh or a child, and afterwards under the appearance of bread. Nor is there any deception there, as occurs in the feats of magicians, because such <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is divinely formed in the eye in order to represent some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, namely, for the purpose of showing that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> without deception appeared to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who were going to <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Qq. Evang. ii) that "when our pretense is referred to some significance, it is not a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, but a figure of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." And since in this way no change is made in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it is manifest that, when such apparition occurs, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not cease to be under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>But it sometimes happens that such apparition comes about not merely by a change wrought in the beholders, but by an appearance which really <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> outwardly. And this indeed is seen to happen when it is beheld by everyone under such an appearance, and it remains so not for an hour, but for a considerable time; and, in this case some think that it is the proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body. Nor does it matter that sometimes <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> entire body is not seen there, but part of His flesh, or else that it is not seen in youthful guise. but in the semblance of a child, because it lies within the power of a glorified body for it to be seen by a non-glorified eye either entirely or in part, and under its own semblance or in strange guise, as will be said later (XP, 85, 2,3).

<p>But this seems unlikely. First of all, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body under its proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> can be seen only in one place, wherein it is definitively contained. Hence since it is seen in its proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, it is not seen under its proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Secondly, because a glorified body, which appears at will, disappears when it wills after the apparition; thus it is related (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse31">Luke 24:31</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> "vanished out of sight" of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. But that which appears under the likeness of flesh in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, continues for a long time; indeed, one reads of its being sometimes enclosed, and, by order of many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, preserved in a pyx, which it would be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to think of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> under His proper semblance.

<p>Consequently, it remains to be said, that, while the dimensions remain the same as before, there is a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> change wrought in the other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, such as shape, color, and the rest, so that flesh, or blood, or a child, is seen. And, as was said already, this is not deception, because it is done "to represent the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," namely, to show by this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> apparition that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and blood are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And thus it is clear that as the dimensions remain, which are the foundation of the other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, as we shall see later on (77, 2), the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> remains in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When such apparition takes place, the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> sometimes continue entire in themselves; and sometimes only as to that which is principal, as was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above, during such apparitions Christ's proper semblance is not seen, but a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> formed either in the eyes of the beholders, or in the sacramental dimensions themselves, as was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The dimensions of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> bread and wine continue, while a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> change is wrought in the other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, as stated above.
