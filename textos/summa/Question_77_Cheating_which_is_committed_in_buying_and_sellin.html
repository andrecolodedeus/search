<h1>Question 77. Cheating, which is committed in buying and selling</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3077.htm#article1"> Unjust sales as regards the price: namely, is it lawful to sell a thing for more than its worth?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3077.htm#article2"> Unjust sales on the part of the thing sold</a> <li><a href="../summa/3077.htm#article3"> Is the seller bound to reveal a fault in the thing sold?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3077.htm#article4"> Is it lawful in trading to sell a thing at a higher price than was paid for it?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is lawful to sell a thing for more than its worth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is lawful to sell a thing for more than its worth. On the commutations of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, civil laws determine that which is just. Now according to these laws it is just for buyer and seller to deceive one another (Cod. IV, xliv, De Rescind. Vend. 8,15): and this occurs by the seller selling a thing for more than its worth, and the buyer buying a thing for less than its worth. Therefore it is lawful to sell a thing for more than its worth.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is common to all would seem to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> relates that the saying of a certain jester was accepted by all, "You wish to buy for a song and to sell at a premium," which agrees with the saying of <a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse14">Proverbs 20:14</a>, "It is naught, it is naught, saith every buyer: and when he is gone away, then he will boast." Therefore it is lawful to sell a thing for more than its worth.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it does not seem unlawful if that which honesty demands be done by mutual agreement. Now, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 13), in the friendship which is based on utility, the amount of the recompense for a favor received should depend on the utility accruing to the receiver: and this utility sometimes is worth more than the thing given, for instance if the receiver be in great need of that thing, whether for the purpose of avoiding a danger, or of deriving some particular benefit. Therefore, in contracts of buying and selling, it is lawful to give a thing in return for more than its worth.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse12">Matthew 7:12</a>): "All things . . . whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you also to them." But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wishes to buy a thing for more than its worth. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should sell a thing to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for more than its worth.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is altogether <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to have recourse to deceit in order to sell a thing for more than its just price, because this is to deceive one's neighbor so as to injure him. Hence Tully says (De Offic. iii, 15): "Contracts should be entirely free from double-dealing: the seller must not impose upon the bidder, nor the buyer upon one that bids against him."

<p>But, apart from <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, we may speak of buying and selling in two ways. First, as considered in themselves, and from this point of view, buying and selling seem to be established for the common advantage of both parties, one of whom requires that which belongs to the other, and vice versa, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Polit. i, 3). Now whatever is established for the common advantage, should not be more of a burden to one party than to another, and consequently all contracts between them should observe equality of thing and thing. Again, the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of a thing that comes into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> use is measured by the price given for it, for which purpose money was invented, as stated in Ethic. v, 5. Therefore if either the price exceed the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the thing's worth, or, conversely, the thing exceed the price, there is no longer the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and consequently, to sell a thing for more than its worth, or to buy it for less than its worth, is in itself <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and unlawful.

<p>Secondly we may speak of buying and selling, considered as <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> tending to the advantage of one party, and to the disadvantage of the other: for instance, when a man has great need of a certain thing, while an other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will suffer if he be without it. On such a case the just price will depend not only on the thing sold, but on the loss which the sale brings on the seller. And thus it will be lawful to sell a thing for more than it is worth in itself, though the price paid be not more than it is worth to the owner. Yet if the one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> derive a great advantage by becoming possessed of the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> property, and the seller be not at a loss through being without that thing, the latter ought not to raise the price, because the advantage accruing to the buyer, is not due to the seller, but to a circumstance affecting the buyer. Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should sell what is not his, though he may charge for the loss he suffers.

<p>On the other hand if a man find that he derives great advantage from something he has bought, he may, of his own accord, pay the seller something over and above: and this pertains to his honesty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (I-II, 96, 2) <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is given to the people among whom there are many lacking <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and it is not given to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> alone. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was unable to forbid all that is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and it suffices for it to prohibit whatever is destructive of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> intercourse, while it treats other matters as though they were lawful, not by approving of them, but by not punishing them. Accordingly, if without employing deceit the seller disposes of his goods for more than their worth, or the buyer obtain them for less than their worth, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> looks upon this as licit, and provides no punishment for so doing, unless the excess be too great, because then even <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> demands restitution to be made, for instance if a man be deceived in regard to more than half the amount of the just price of a thing [Cod. IV, xliv, De Rescind. Vend. 2,8.

<p>On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> leaves nothing unpunished that is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence, according to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, it is reckoned unlawful if the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be not observed in buying and selling: and he who has received more than he ought must make compensation to him that has suffered loss, if the loss be considerable. I add this <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, because the just price of things is not fixed with mathematical precision, but depends on a kind of estimate, so that a slight addition or subtraction would not seem to destroy the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says "this jester, either by looking into himself or by his experience of others, thought that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are inclined to wish to buy for a song and sell at a premium. But since in reality this is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, it is in every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power to acquire that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> whereby he may resist and overcome this inclination." And then he gives the example of a man who gave the just price for a book to a man who through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> asked a low price for it. Hence it is evident that this common desire is not from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, wherefore it is common to many who walk along the broad road of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> we consider chiefly real equality. On the other hand, in friendship based on utility we consider equality of usefulness, so that the recompense should depend on the usefulness accruing, whereas in buying it should be equal to the thing bought.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a sale is rendered unlawful through a fault in the thing sold?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a sale is not rendered <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and unlawful through a fault in the thing sold. For less account should be taken of the other parts of a thing than of what belongs to its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Yet the sale of a thing does not seem to be rendered unlawful through a fault in its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>: for instance, if a man sell instead of the real metal, silver or gold produced by some chemical process, which is adapted to all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> uses for which silver and gold are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for instance in the making of vessels and the like. Much less therefore will it be an unlawful sale if the thing be defective in other ways.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, any fault in the thing, affecting the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, would seem chiefly to be opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which consists in equality. Now <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by being measured: and the measures of things that come into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> use are not fixed, but in some places are greater, in others less, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. v, 7). Therefore just as it is impossible to avoid defects on the part of the thing sold, it seems that a sale is not rendered unlawful through the thing sold being defective.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the thing sold is rendered defective by lacking a fitting <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. But in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of a thing, much <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is required that is lacking in most buyers. Therefore a sale is not rendered unlawful by a fault (in the thing sold).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. iii, 11): "It is manifestly a rule of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not depart from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor inflict an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> injury on anyone, nor have any connection with <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A threefold fault may be found pertaining to the thing which is sold. One, in respect of the thing's <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>: and if the seller be aware of a fault in the thing he is selling, he is guilty of a fraudulent sale, so that the sale is rendered unlawful. Hence we find it written against certain people (<a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse22">Isaiah 1:22</a>), "Thy silver is turned into dross, thy wine is mingled with water": because that which is mixed is defective in its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p>Another defect is in respect of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by being measured: wherefore if anyone knowingly make use of a faulty measure in selling, he is guilty of <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, and the sale is illicit. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 25:13-14</a>): "Thou shalt not have divers weights in thy bag, a greater and a less: neither shall there be in thy house a greater bushel and a less," and further on (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy 25:16</a>): "For the Lord . . . abhorreth him that doth these things, and He hateth all <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>."

<p>A third defect is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, for instance, if a man sell an unhealthy animal as being a healthy one: and if anyone do this knowingly he is guilty of a fraudulent sale, and the sale, in consequence, is illicit.

<p>In all these cases not only is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> guilty of a fraudulent sale, but he is also bound to restitution. But if any of the foregoing defects be in the thing sold, and he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing about this, the seller does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he does that which is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> materially, nor is his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, as shown above (Question 59, Article 2). Nevertheless he is bound to compensate the buyer, when the defect comes to his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Moreover what has been said of the seller applies equally to the buyer. For sometimes it happens that the seller thinks his goods to be specifically of lower value, as when a man sells gold instead of copper, and then if the buyer be aware of this, he buys it <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> and is bound to restitution: and the same applies to a defect in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> as to a defect in <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Gold and silver are costly not only on account of the usefulness of the vessels and other like things made from them, but also on account of the excellence and purity of their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Hence if the gold or silver produced by alchemists has not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of gold and silver, the sale thereof is fraudulent and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, especially as real gold and silver can produce certain results by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> action, which the counterfeit gold and silver of alchemists cannot produce. Thus the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> metal has the property of making people <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyful</a>, and is helpful medicinally against certain maladies. Moreover real gold can be employed more frequently, and lasts longer in its <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of purity than counterfeit gold. If however real gold were to be produced by alchemy, it would not be unlawful to sell it for the genuine article, for nothing prevents art from employing certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> for the production of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> effects, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 8) of things produced by the art of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The measures of salable commodities must needs be different in different places, on account of the difference of supply: because where there is greater abundance, the measures are wont to be larger. However in each place those who govern the state must determine the just measures of things salable, with due consideration for the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of place and time. Hence it is not lawful to disregard such measures as are established by public authority or custom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xi, 16) the price of things salable does not depend on their degree of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since at times a horse fetches a higher price than a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>; but it depends on their usefulness to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the seller or buyer to be cognizant of the hidden <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the thing sold, but only of such as render the thing adapted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> use, for instance, that the horse be strong, run well and so forth. Such <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> the seller and buyer can easily discover.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the seller is bound to state the defects of the thing sold?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the seller is not bound to state the defects of the thing sold. Since the seller does not bind the buyer to buy, he would seem to leave it to him to judge of the goods offered for sale. Now judgment about a thing and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that thing belong to the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore it does not seem imputable to the seller if the buyer be deceived in his judgment, and be hurried into buying a thing without carefully inquiring into its <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it seems foolish for anyone to do what prevents him carrying out his work. But if a man states the defects of the goods he has for sale, he prevents their sale: wherefore Tully (De Offic. iii, 13) pictures a man as saying: "Could anything be more absurd than for a public crier, instructed by the owner, to cry: 'I offer this unhealthy horse for sale?'" Therefore the seller is not bound to state the defects of the thing sold.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs more to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the road of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the faults of things offered for sale. Now one is not bound to offer advice to all or to tell them the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, though one should not tell anyone what is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Much less therefore is a seller bound to tell the faults of what he offers for sale, as though he were counseling the buyer.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if one were bound to tell the faults of what one offers for sale, this would only be in order to lower the price. Now sometimes the price would be lowered for some other reason, without any defect in the thing sold: for instance, if the seller carry wheat to a place where wheat fetches a high price, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that many will come after him carrying wheat; because if the buyers <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this they would give a lower price. But apparently the seller need not give the buyer this information. Therefore, in like manner, neither need he tell him the faults of the goods he is selling.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. iii, 10): "In all contracts the defects of the salable commodity must be stated; and unless the seller make them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, although the buyer has already acquired a right to them, the contract is voided on account of the fraudulent action."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is always unlawful to give anyone an occasion of danger or loss, although a man need not always give another the help or counsel which would be for his advantage in any way; but only in certain fixed cases, for instance when someone is subject to him, or when he is the only one who can assist him. Now the seller who offers goods for sale, gives the buyer an occasion of loss or danger, by the very fact that he offers him defective goods, if such defect may occasion loss or danger to the buyer--loss, if, by reason of this defect, the goods are of less value, and he takes nothing off the price on that account--danger, if this defect either hinder the use of the goods or render it hurtful, for instance, if a man sells a lame for a fleet horse, a tottering house for a safe one, rotten or poisonous food for wholesome. Wherefore if such like defects be hidden, and the seller does not make them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the sale will be illicit and fraudulent, and the seller will be bound to compensation for the loss incurred.

<p>On the other hand, if the defect be manifest, for instance if a horse have but one eye, or if the goods though useless to the buyer, be useful to someone else, provided the seller take as much as he ought from the price, he is not bound to state the defect of the goods, since perhaps on account of that defect the buyer might want him to allow a greater rebate than he need. Wherefore the seller may look to his own indemnity, by withholding the defect of the goods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Judgment cannot be pronounced save on what is manifest: for "a man judges of what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>" (Ethic. i, 3). Hence if the defects of the goods offered for sale be hidden, judgment of them is not sufficiently left with the buyer unless such defects be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him. The case would be different if the defects were manifest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There is no need to publish beforehand by the public crier the defects of the goods one is offering for sale, because if he were to begin by announcing its defects, the bidders would be frightened to buy, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of other <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> that might render the thing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and serviceable. Such defect ought to be stated to each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> that offers to buy: and then he will be able to compare the various points one with the other, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> with the bad: for nothing prevents that which is defective in one respect being useful in many others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although a man is not bound strictly speaking to tell everyone the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, yet he is so bound in a case when, unless he tells the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, his conduct would endanger another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in detriment to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and so it is in this case.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The defect in a thing makes it of less value now than it seems to be: but in the case cited, the goods are expected to be of less value at a future time, on account of the arrival of other merchants, which was not foreseen by the buyers. Wherefore the seller, since he sells his goods at the price actually offered him, does not seem to act contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> through not stating what is going to happen. If however he were to do so, or if he lowered his price, it would be exceedingly <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> on his part: although he does not seem to be bound to do this as a debt of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether, in trading, it is lawful to sell a thing at a higher price than what was paid for it?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not lawful, in trading, to sell a thing for a higher price than we paid for it. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xxxviii in the Opus Imperfectum, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] says on <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse12">Matthew 21:12</a>: "He that buys a thing in order that he may sell it, entire and unchanged, at a profit, is the trader who is cast out of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> temple." <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> speaks in the same sense in his commentary on <a href="../bible/psa070.htm#verse15">Psalm 70:15</a>, "Because I have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> learning, or trading" according to another version [the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>]: "What is trade," says he, "but buying at a cheap price with the purpose of retailing at a higher price?" and he adds: "Such were the tradesmen whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> cast out of the temple." Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is cast out of the temple except for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore such like trading is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to sell goods at a higher price than their worth, or to buy them for less than their value, as shown above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now if you sell a thing for a higher price than you paid for it, you must either have bought it for less than its value, or sell it for more than its value. Therefore this cannot be done without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. ad Nepot. lii): "Shun, as you would the plague, a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> who from being poor has become wealthy, or who, from being a nobody has become a celebrity." Now trading would net seem to be forbidden to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> except on account of its sinfulness. Therefore it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in trading, to buy at a low price and to sell at a higher price.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> commenting on <a href="../bible/psa070.htm#verse15">Psalm 70:15</a>, "Because I have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> learning," [Cf. Objection 1 says: "The greedy tradesman blasphemes over his losses; he lies and perjures himself over the price of his wares. But these are <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not of the craft, which can be exercised without these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>." Therefore trading is not in itself unlawful.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A tradesman is one whose business consists in the exchange of things. According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Polit. i, 3), exchange of things is twofold; one, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> as it were, and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, whereby one commodity is exchanged for another, or money taken in exchange for a commodity, in order to satisfy the needs of life. Such like trading, properly speaking, does not belong to tradesmen, but rather to housekeepers or civil servants who have to provide the household or the state with the necessaries of life. The other kind of exchange is either that of money for money, or of any commodity for money, not on account of the necessities of life, but for profit, and this kind of exchange, properly speaking, regards tradesmen, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Polit. i, 3). The former kind of exchange is commendable because it supplies a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> need: but the latter is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> deserving of blame, because, considered in itself, it satisfies the greed for gain, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no limit and tends to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Hence trading, considered in itself, has a certain debasement attaching thereto, in so far as, by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it does not imply a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> end. Nevertheless gain which is the end of trading, though not implying, by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, anything <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, does not, in itself, connote anything <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> or contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: wherefore nothing prevents gain from being directed to some <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> or even <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> end, and thus trading becomes lawful. Thus, for instance, a man may intend the moderate gain which he seeks to acquire by trading for the upkeep of his household, or for the assistance of the needy: or again, a man may take to trade for some public advantage, for instance, lest his country lack the necessaries of life, and seek gain, not as an end, but as payment for his labor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The saying of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> refers to the trading which seeks gain as a last end. This is especially the case where a man sells something at a higher price without its undergoing any change. For if he sells at a higher price something that has changed for the better, he would seem to receive the reward of his labor. Nevertheless the gain itself may be lawfully intended, not as a last end, but for the sake of some other end which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not everyone that sells at a higher price than he bought is a tradesman, but only he who buys that he may sell at a profit. If, on the contrary, he buys not for sale but for possession, and afterwards, for some reason wishes to sell, it is not a trade transaction even if he sell at a profit. For he may lawfully do this, either because he has bettered the thing, or because the value of the thing has changed with the change of place or time, or on account of the danger he incurs in transferring the thing from one place to another, or again in having it carried by another. On this sense neither buying nor selling is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Clerics should abstain not only from things that are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in themselves, but even from those that have an appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. This happens in trading, both because it is directed to worldly gain, which <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> should despise, and because trading is open to so many <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, since "a merchant is hardly free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the lips" ['A merchant is hardly free from negligence, and a huckster shall not be justified from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the lips'] (<a href="../bible/sir026.htm#verse28">Sirach 26:28</a>). There is also another reason, because trading engages the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> too much with worldly cares, and consequently withdraws it from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> cares; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse4">2 Timothy 2:4</a>): "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> being a soldier to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> entangleth himself with secular businesses." Nevertheless it is lawful for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to engage in the first mentioned kind of exchange, which is directed to supply the necessaries of life, either by buying or by selling.
