<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the accidents remain in this sacrament without a subject?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> do not remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> without a subject, because there ought not to be anything disorderly or deceitful in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But for <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> to be without a subject is contrary to the order which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> established in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and furthermore it seems to savor of deceit, since <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> the signs of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the subject. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are not without a subject in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, not even by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> can the definition of a thing be severed from it, or the definition of another thing be applied to it; for instance, that, while <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> remains a man, he can be an irrational animal. For it would follow that contradictories can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> at the one time: for the "definition of a thing is what its name expresses," as is said in Metaph. iv. But it belongs to the definition of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> for it to be in a subject, while the definition of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is that it must subsist of itself, and not in another. Therefore it cannot come to pass, even by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without a subject in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is individuated by its subject. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> without a subject, they will not be <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but general, which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because thus they would not be sensible, but merely intelligible.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> do not obtain any composition. But before the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> they were not composed either of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, nor of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> [quo est] and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> [quod est]. Therefore, even after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> they are not composite in either of these ways. But this is unreasonable, for thus they would be simpler than <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, whereas at the same time these <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are perceptible to the senses. Therefore, in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> do not remain without a subject.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in an <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Homily (Lanfranc, De Corp. et Sang. Dom. xx) that "the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are the names of those things which were there before, namely, of the bread and wine." Therefore since the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and the wine does not remain, it seems that these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> remain without a subject.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the bread and wine, which are perceived by our senses to remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, are not subjected in the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine, for that does not remain, as stated above (Question 75, Article 2); nor in the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, for that does not remain (75, 6), and if it did remain, "it could not be a subject," as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> declares (De Trin. i). Furthermore it is manifest that these <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are not subjected in the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and blood, because the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body cannot in any way be affected by such <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>; nor is it possible for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and impassible body to be altered so as to receive these <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>.

<p>Now there are some who say that they are in the surrounding atmosphere as in a subject. But even this cannot be: in the first place, because atmosphere is not susceptive of such <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. Secondly, because these <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are not where the atmosphere is, nay more, the atmosphere is displaced by the motion of these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Thirdly, because <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> do not pass from subject to subject, so that the same identical <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> which was first in one subject be afterwards in another; because an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is individuated by the subject; hence it cannot come to pass for an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> remaining identically the same to be at one time in one subject, and at another time in another. Fourthly, since the atmosphere is not deprived of its own <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, it would have at the one time its own <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> and others foreign to it. Nor can it be maintained that this is done <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, because the words of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> do not signify this, and they effect only what they signify.

<p>Therefore it follows that the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> continue in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> without a subject. This can be done by Divine power: for since an effect depends more upon the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> than on the second, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> both of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, can by His unlimited power preserve an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> when the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is withdrawn whereby it was preserved in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as by its proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, just as without <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> He can produce other effects of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, even as He formed a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body in the Virgin's womb, "without the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" (Hymn for Christmas, First Vespers).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is nothing to hinder the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from ordaining a thing, the contrary of which is nevertheless ordained by a special privilege of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as is evident in the raising of the dead, and in the restoring of sight to the blind: even thus in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, to some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> some things are granted by special privilege which are outside the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. And so, even though it be according to the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> for an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> to be in a subject, still for a special reason, according to the order of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> without a subject, on account of the reasons given above (75, 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since being is not a genus, then being cannot be of itself the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of either <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Consequently, the definition of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is not--"a being of itself without a subject," nor is the definition of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>--"a being in a subject"; but it belongs to the quiddity or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> "to have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> not in a subject"; while it belongs to the quiddity or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> "to have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in a subject." But in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> it is not in virtue of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> that <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are not in a subject, but through the Divine power sustaining them; and consequently they do not cease to be <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, because neither is the definition of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> withdrawn from them, nor does the definition of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> apply to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> acquired <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> being in the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine; and when this <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is changed into the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they remain in that individuated being which they possessed before, hence they are <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> and sensible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> These <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> had no being of their own nor other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, so long as the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine remained; but their subjects had "such" being through them, just as snow is "white" through whiteness. But after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> which remain have being; hence they are compounded of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as was said of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in I, 50, 2, ad 3; and besides they have composition of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantitative</a> parts.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether in this sacrament the dimensive quantity of the bread or wine is the subject of the other accidents?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the bread or wine is not the subject of the other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is not the subject of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; because no form can be a subject, since to be a subject is a property of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Therefore dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> cannot be the subject of the other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is individuated by <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, so also are the other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. If, then, the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the bread or wine remains individuated according to the being it had before, in which it is preserved, for like reason the other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> remain individuated according to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> which they had before in the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore they are not in dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> as in a subject, since every <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is individuated by its own subject.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, among the other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> that remain, of the bread and wine, the senses perceive also rarity and density, which cannot be in dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> outside <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; because a thing is rare which has little <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> under great dimensions. while a thing is dense which has much <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> under small dimensions, as is said in Phys. iv. It does not seem, then, that dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> can be the subject of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> which remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> abstract from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> seems to be mathematical <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, which is not the subject of sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>. Since, then, the remaining <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> are sensible, it seems that in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> they cannot be subjected in the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the bread and wine that remains after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Qualities are divisible only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, that is, by reason of the subject. But the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> remaining in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> are divided by the division of dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as is evident through our senses. Therefore, dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is the subject of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> which remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that the other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> which remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> are subjected in the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the bread and wine that remains: first of all, because something having <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> and color and affected by other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> is perceived by the senses; nor is sense deceived in such. Secondly, because the first disposition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, hence <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> also assigned "great" and "small" as the first differences of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> (<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Metaph. iv). And because the first subject is <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the consequence is that all other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are related to their subject through the medium of dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; just as the first subject of color is said to be the surface, on which account some have maintained that dimensions are the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> of bodies, as is said in Metaph. iii. And since, when the subject is withdrawn, the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> remain according to the being which they had before, it follows that all <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> remain founded upon dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>.

<p>Thirdly, because, since the subject is the principle of individuation of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for what is admitted as the subject of some <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> to be somehow the principle of individuation: for it is of the very notion of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> that it cannot be in several; and this happens in two ways. First, because it is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to it to be in any one; and in this way immaterial separated forms, subsisting of themselves, are also <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> of themselves. Secondly, because a form, be it <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> in someone indeed, not in several, as this whiteness, which is in this body. As to the first, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the principle of individuation of all inherent forms, because, since these forms, considered in themselves, are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> in something as in a subject, from the very fact that one of them is received in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is not in another, it follows that neither can the form itself thus <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> be in another. As to the second, it must be maintained that the principle of individuation is dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. For that something is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> in another one solely, is due to the fact that that other is undivided in itself, and distinct from all others. But it is on account of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> that <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> can be divided, as is said in Phys. i. And therefore dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> itself is a particular principle of individuation in forms of this kind, namely, inasmuch as forms numerically distinct are in different parts of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence also dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> has of itself a kind of individuation, so that we can <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> several lines of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, differing in position, which is included in the notion of this <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; for it belongs to dimension for it to be "<a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> having position" (<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Categor. iv), and therefore dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> can be the subject of the other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, rather than the other way about.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> One <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> cannot of itself be the subject of another, because it does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> of itself. But inasmuch as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is received in another thing, one is said to be the subject of the other, inasmuch as one is received in a subject through another, as the surface is said to be the subject of color. Hence when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> of itself, it can also be of itself the subject of another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, even as they were in the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread, were individuated by means of dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as stated above. And therefore dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is the subject of the other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> remaining in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, rather than conversely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Rarity and density are particular <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> accompanying bodies, by reason of their having much or little <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> under dimensions; just as all other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> likewise follow from the principles of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. And consequently, as the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are preserved by Divine power when the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is withdrawn, so, when <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is withdrawn, the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> which go with <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, such as rarity and density, are preserved by Divine power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Mathematical <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> abstracts not from intelligible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but from sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as is said in Metaph. vii. But <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is termed sensible because it underlies sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>. And therefore it is manifest that the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, which remains in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> without a subject, is not mathematical <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the species remaining in this sacrament can change external objects?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> cannot affect external objects. For it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. vii, that forms which are in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are produced by forms that are in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but not from forms which are without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, because like makes like. But the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since they remain without a subject, as is evident from what was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore they cannot affect other <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by producing any form in it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, when the action of the principal agent ceases, then the action of the instrument must cease, as when the carpenter rests, the hammer is moved no longer. But all <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> forms act instrumentally in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form as the principal agent. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the bread and wine does not remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as was shown above (Question 75, Article 6), it seems that the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> forms which remain cannot act so as to change external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing acts outside its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, because an effect cannot surpass its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But all the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. Therefore they cannot change external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, at least as to a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If they could not change external bodies, they could not be felt; for a thing is felt from the senses being changed by a sensible thing, as is said in De Anima ii.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Because everything acts in so far as it is an actual being, the consequence is that everything stands in the same relation to action as it does to being. Therefore, because, according to what was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it is an effect of the Divine power that the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> continue in the being which they had when the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine was present, it follows that they continue in their action. Consequently they retain every action which they had while the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine remained, now that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine has passed into the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that they can change external bodies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, although they are forms <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, still retain the same being which they had before in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and therefore as to their being they are like forms which are in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The action of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form depends upon the action of a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form in the same way as the being of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> depends upon the being of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; and therefore, as it is an effect of Divine power that the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, so is it an effect of Divine power that they can act without a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, because every action of a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form depends upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the first agent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The change which terminates in a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form is not effected by a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form directly, but by means of the active and passive <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, which act in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form. But by Divine power this instrumental energy is retained in the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, just as it was before: and consequently their action can be directed to a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form instrumentally, just in the same way as anything can act outside its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, not as by its own power, but by the power of the chief agent.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the sacramental species can be corrupted?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cannot be corrupted, because corruption comes of the separation of the form from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the bread does not remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as is clear from what was said above (Question 75, Article 2). Therefore these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cannot be corrupted.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no form is corrupted except <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, that is, when its subject is corrupted; hence self-subsisting forms are incorruptible, as is seen in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. But the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are forms without a subject. Therefore they cannot be corrupted.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if they be corrupted, it will either be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> or <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>. But they cannot be corrupted <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, because no subject of corruption can be assigned as remaining after the corruption has taken place. Neither can they be corrupted <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which occur in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> take place in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, whereby the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are preserved: and the same thing is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of preservation and of corruption. Therefore, in no way can the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> be corrupted.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We perceive by our senses that the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> hosts become putrefied and corrupted.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Corruption is "movement from being into non-being" (<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Phys. v). Now it has been stated (3) that the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> retain the same being as they had before when the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread was present. Consequently, as the being of those <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> could be corrupted while the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine was present, so likewise they can be corrupted now that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> has passed away.

<p>But such <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> could have been previously corrupted in two ways: in one way, of themselves; in another way, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. They could be corrupted of themselves, as by alteration of the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, and increase or decrease of the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, not in the way in which increase or decrease is found only in animated bodies, such as the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> of the bread and wine are not, but by addition or division; for, as is said in Metaph. iii, one dimension is dissolved by division, and two dimensions result; while on the contrary, by addition, two dimensions become one. And in this way such <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> can be corrupted manifestly after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, because the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> which remains can receive division and addition; and since it is the subject of sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it can likewise be the subject of their alteration, for instance, if the color or the savor of the bread or wine be altered.

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> can be corrupted in another way, through the corruption of its subject, and in this way also they can be corrupted after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; for although the subject does not remain, still the being which they had in the subject does remain, which being is proper, and suited to the subject. And therefore such being can be corrupted by a contrary agent, as the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread or wine was subject to corruption, and, moreover, was not corrupted except by a preceding alteration regarding the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>.

<p>Nevertheless, a distinction must be made between each of the aforesaid corruptions; because, when the body and the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> succeed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine, if there be such change on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> as would not have sufficed for the corruption of the bread and wine, then the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> do not cease to be under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> on account of such change, whether the change be on the part of the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, as for instance, when the color or the savor of the bread or wine is slightly modified; or on the part of the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as when the bread or the wine is divided into such parts as to keep in them the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of bread or of wine. But if the change be so great that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread or wine would have been corrupted, then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and blood do not remain under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; and this either on the part of the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, as when the color, savor, and other <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the bread and wine are so altered as to be incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of bread or of wine; or else on the part of the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as, for instance, if the bread be reduced to fine particles, or the wine divided into such tiny drops that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of bread or wine no longer remain.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since it belongs <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to corruption to take away the being of a thing, in so far as the being of some form is in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it results that by corruption the form is separated from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But if such being were not in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, yet like such being as is in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it could be taken away by corruption, even where there is no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; as takes place in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as is evident from what was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are forms not in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, yet they have the being which they had in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This corruption of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>, but <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>; nevertheless, it presupposes the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> which is wrought in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, namely, that those sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> retain without a subject, the same being as they had in a subject; just as a blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to whom sight is given <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>, sees <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether anything can be generated from the sacramental species?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that nothing can be generated from the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: because, whatever is generated, is generated out of some <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: for nothing is generated out of nothing, although by creation something is made out of nothing. But there is no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> underlying the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> except that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, and that body is incorruptible. Therefore it seems that nothing can be generated from the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, things which are not of the same genus cannot spring from one another: thus a line is not made of whiteness. But <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> and <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> differ generically. Therefore, since the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, it seems that no <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> can be generated from them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if any corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> be generated from them, such <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> will not be without <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Therefore, if any corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> be generated from the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, then <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> would be generated from <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, namely, two things from one, which is impossible. Consequently, it is impossible for any corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> to be generated out of the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The senses are witness that something is generated out of the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, either ashes, if they be burned, worms if they putrefy, or dust if they be crushed.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since "the corruption of one thing is the generation of another" (De Gener. i), something must be generated <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> from the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> if they be corrupted, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>); for they are not corrupted in such a way that they disappear altogether, as if reduced to nothing; on the contrary, something sensible manifestly succeeds to them.

<p>Nevertheless, it is difficult to see how anything can be generated from them. For it is quite evident that nothing is generated out of the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> there, because these are incorruptible. But if the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, or even the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, of the bread and wine were to remain in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, then, as some have maintained, it would be easy to account for this sensible object which succeeds to them. But that supposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as was stated above (75, 2,4,8).

<p>Hence it is that others have said that the things generated have not sprung from the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but from the surrounding atmosphere. But this can be shown in many ways to be impossible. In the first place, because when a thing is generated from another, the latter at first appears changed and corrupted; whereas no alteration or corruption appeared previously in the adjacent atmosphere; hence the worms or ashes are not generated therefrom. Secondly, because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the atmosphere is not such as to permit of such things being generated by such alterations. Thirdly, because it is possible for many <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> hosts to be burned or putrefied; nor would it be possible for an earthen body, large enough to be generated from the atmosphere, unless a great and, in fact, exceedingly sensible condensation of the atmosphere took place. Fourthly, because the same thing can happen to the solid bodies surrounding them, such as iron or stone, which remain entire after the generation of the aforesaid things. Hence this opinion cannot stand, because it is opposed to what is manifest to our senses.

<p>And therefore others have said that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine returns during the corruption of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and so from the returning <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine, ashes or worms or something of the kind are generated. But this explanation seems an impossible one. First of all, because if the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> into the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as was shown above (75, 2,4), the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine cannot return, except the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be again changed back into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread and wine, which is impossible: thus if air be turned into fire, the air cannot return without the fire being again changed into air. But if the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread or wine be annihilated, it cannot return again, because what lapses into nothing does not return numerically the same. Unless perchance it be said that the said <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> returns, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> creates anew another new <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> to replace the first. Secondly, this seems to be impossible, because no time can be assigned when the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread returns. For, from what was said above (4; 76, 6, ad 3), it is evident that while the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the bread and wine remain, there remain also the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which are not present together with the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, according to what was stated above (Question 75, Article 2). Hence the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine cannot return while the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> remain; nor, again, when these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> pass away; because then the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread and wine would be without their proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, which is impossible. Unless perchance it be said that in the last instant of the corruption of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> there returns (not, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread and wine, because it is in that very instant that they have the being of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> generated from the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but) the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the bread and wine; which, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, properly speaking, would be more correctly described as <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> anew, than as returning. And in this sense the aforesaid position might be held.

<p>However, since it does not seem reasonable to say that anything takes place <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, except in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> itself, which does not imply either creation or return of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it seems better to say that in the actual <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> it is <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> bestowed on the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the bread and wine to be the subject of subsequent forms. Now this is proper to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and therefore as a consequence everything which goes with <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is bestowed on dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; and therefore everything which could be generated from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of bread or wine, if it were present, can be generated from the aforesaid dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the bread or wine, not, indeed, by a new <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, but by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> which has already taken place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is there out of which a thing may be generated, nevertheless dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> supplies the place of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are indeed <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, yet they have the act and power of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the bread and wine retains its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and receives <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> the power and property of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; and therefore it can pass to both, that is, into <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and dimension.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the sacramental species can nourish?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cannot nourish, because, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. v), "it is not this bread that enters into our body, but the bread of everlasting life, which supports the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." But whatever nourishes enters into the body. Therefore this bread does not nourish: and the same reason holds good of the wine.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as is said in De Gener. ii, "We are nourished by the very things of which we are made." But the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not made of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, because <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore it seems that the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cannot nourish.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii) that "food nourishes according as it is a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but it gives increase by reason of its <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>." But the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are not a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Consequently they cannot nourish.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> speaking of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse21">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>): "One, indeed, is hungry, and another is drunk": upon which the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes that "he alludes to those who after the celebration of the sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, and after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread and wine, claimed their oblations, and not sharing them with others, took the whole, so as even to become intoxicated thereby." But this could not happen if the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> did not nourish. Therefore the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> do nourish.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This question presents no difficulty, now that we have solved the preceding question. Because, as stated in De Anima ii, food nourishes by being converted into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> nourished. Now it has been stated (5) that the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> can be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> into a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> generated from them. And they can be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> into the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body for the same reason as they can into ashes or worms. Consequently, it is evident that they nourish.

<p>But the senses witness to the untruth of what some maintain; viz. that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> do not nourish as though they were changed into the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, but merely refresh and hearten by acting upon the senses (as a man is heartened by the odor of meat, and intoxicated by the fumes of wine). Because such refreshment does not suffice long for a man, whose body needs repair owing to constant waste: and yet a man could be supported for long if he were to take hosts and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine in great <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>.

<p>In like manner the statement advanced by others cannot stand, who hold that the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> nourish owing to the remaining <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the bread and wine: both because the form does not remain, as stated above (Question 75, Article 6): and because to nourish is the act not of a form but rather of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which takes the form of the one nourished, while the form of the nourishment passes away: hence it is said in De Anima ii that nourishment is at first unlike, but at the end is like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> After the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> bread can be said to be in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in two ways. First, as to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which retain the name of the previous <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in an <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Homily (Lanfranc, De Corp. et Sang. Dom. xx). Secondly, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> very body can be called bread, since it is the mystical bread "coming down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Consequently, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> uses the word "bread" in this second meaning, when he says that "this bread does not pass into the body," because, to wit, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not changed into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body, but nourishes his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But he is not speaking of bread taken in the first acceptation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are not those things out of which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is made, yet they are changed into those things stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are not a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, still they have the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as stated above.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the sacramental species are broken in this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are not broken in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in Meteor. iv that bodies are breakable owing to a certain disposition of the pores; a thing which cannot be attributed to the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cannot be broken.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, breaking is followed by sound. But the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> emit no sound: because the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii), that what emits sound is a hard body, having a smooth surface. Therefore the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are not broken.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, breaking and mastication are seemingly of the same object. But it is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body that is eaten, according to <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse57">John 6:57</a>: "He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood." Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body that is broken and masticated: and hence it is said in the confession of Berengarius: "I agree with the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church, and with heart and lips I profess, that the bread and wine which are placed on the altar, are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> handled and broken by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> hands, broken and crushed by the teeth of believers." Consequently, the breaking ought not to be ascribed to the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Breaking arises from the division of that which has <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But nothing having <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> except the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is broken here, because neither <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is broken, as being incorruptible, nor is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread, because it no longer remains. Therefore the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are broken.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Many opinions prevailed of old on this matter. Some held that in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> there was no breaking at all in reality, but merely in the eyes of the beholders. But this contention cannot stand, because in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the sense is not deceived with regard to its proper object of judgment, and one of these objects is breaking, whereby from one thing arise many: and these are common sensibles, as is stated in De Anima ii.

<p>Others accordingly have said that there was indeed a genuine breaking, but without any subject. But this again contradicts our senses; because a <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantitative</a> body is seen in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which formerly was one, and is now divided into many, and this must be the subject of the breaking.

<p>But it cannot be said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body is broken. First of all, because it is incorruptible and impassible: secondly, because it is entire under every part, as was shown above (Question 76, Article 3), which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing broken.

<p>It remains, then, that the breaking is in the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the bread, as in a subject, just as the other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. And as the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body, so is the breaking of these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, which was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As rarity and density remain under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (2, ad 3), so likewise porousness remains, and in consequence breakableness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Hardness results from density; therefore, as density remains under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, hardness remains there too, and the capability of sound as a consequence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> What is eaten under its own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is also broken and masticated under its own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is eaten not under its proper, but under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Hence in explaining <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse64">John 6:64</a>, "The flesh profiteth nothing," <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. xxvii in Joan.) says that this is to be taken as referring to those who understood carnally: "for they understood the flesh, thus, as it is divided piecemeal, in a dead body, or as sold in the shambles." Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> very body is not broken, except according to its sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. And the confession made by Berengarius is to be understood in this sense, that the breaking and the crushing with the teeth is to be referred to the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, under which the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether any liquid can be mingled with the consecrated wine?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that no liquid can be mingled with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine, because everything mingled with another partakes of its <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. But no liquid can share in the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, because those <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are without a subject, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore it seems that no liquid can be mingled with the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the wine.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if any kind of liquid be mixed with those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, then some one thing must be the result. But no one thing can result from the liquid, which is a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>; nor from the liquid and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood, which owing to its incorruptibility suffers neither increase nor decrease. Therefore no liquid can be mixed with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if any liquid be mixed with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine, then that also would appear to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>; just as water added to holy-water becomes <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood. Therefore the liquid added would likewise be <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood otherwise than by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, which is unbecoming. Therefore no liquid can be mingled with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if one of two things be entirely corrupted, there is no mixture (De Gener. i). But if we mix any liquid, it seems that the entire <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the sacramental wine is corrupted, so that the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ceases to be beneath it; both because great and little are difference of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, and alter it, as white and black <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a difference of color; and because the liquid mixed, as having no obstacle, seems to permeate the whole, and so <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood ceases to be there, since it is not there with any other <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Consequently, no liquid can be mixed with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is evident to our senses that another liquid can be mixed with the wine after it is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, just as before.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this question is evident from what has been said already. For it was said above (3; 5, ad 2) that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> remaining in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as they acquire the manner of being of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, so likewise do they obtain the mode of acting and of being acted upon, so that they can do or receive whatever their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> could do or receive, were it there present. But it is evident that if the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of wine were there present, then some other liquid could be mingled with it.

<p>Nevertheless there would be a different effect of such mixing both according to the form and according to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the liquid. For if sufficient liquid were mixed so as to spread itself all through the wine, then the whole would be a mixed <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Now what is made up of things mixed is neither of them, but each passes into a third resulting from both: hence it would result that the former wine would remain no longer. But if the liquid added were of another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, for instance, if water were mixed, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the wine would be dissolved, and there would be a liquid of another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But if liquid of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> were added, of instance, wine with wine, the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> would remain, but the wine would not be the same numerically, as the diversity of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> shows: for instance, if one wine were white and the other red.

<p>But if the liquid added were of such minute <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> that it could not permeate the whole, the entire wine would not be mixed, but only part of it, which would not remain the same numerically owing to the blending of extraneous <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: still it would remain the same specifically, not only if a little liquid of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> were mixed with it, but even if it were of another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, since a drop of water blended with much wine passes into the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of wine (De Gener. i).

<p>Now it is evident that the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> abide in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> so long as the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> remain numerically the same, as stated above (4; 76, 6, ad 3); because it is this bread and this wine which is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Hence, if the liquid of any kind whatsoever added be so much in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> as to permeate the whole of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine, and be mixed with it throughout, the result would be something numerically distinct, and the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will remain there no longer. But if the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the liquid added be so slight as not to permeate throughout, but to reach only a part of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood will cease to be under that part of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine, yet will remain under the rest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> writes thus: "The very <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> appear to affect the wine that is added, because, if water is added, it takes the savor of the wine. The result is, then, that the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> change the subject, just as subject changes <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>; for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> yields to <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, and power works beyond custom." But this must not be understood as if the same identical <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, which was in the wine previous to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, is afterwards in the wine that is added; but such change is the result of action; because the remaining <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of the wine retain the action of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as stated above, and so they act upon the liquid added, by changing it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The liquid added to the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine is in no way mixed with the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood. Nevertheless it is mixed with the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, yet so that after such mixing the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are corrupted entirely or in part, after the way mentioned above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), whereby something can be generated from those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. And if they be entirely corrupted, there remains no further question, because the whole will be uniform. But if they be corrupted in part, there will be one dimension according to the continuity of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but not one according to the mode of being, because one part thereof will be without a subject while the other is in a subject; as in a body that is made up of two metals, there will be one body quantitatively, but not one as to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent</a> says in the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a>, "if after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> other wine be put in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, it is not changed into the blood, nor is it mingled with the blood, but, mixed with the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of the previous wine, it is diffused throughout the body which underlies them, yet without wetting what surrounds it." Now this is to be understood when there is not sufficient mixing of extraneous liquid to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to cease to be under the whole; because a thing is said to be "diffused throughout," not because it touches the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to its proper dimensions, but according to the sacramental dimensions, under which it is contained. Now it is not the same with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> water, because the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> works no change in the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the water, as the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the wine does.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Some have held that however slight be the mixing of extraneous liquid, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood ceases to be under the whole, and for the reason given above (Objection 4); which, however, is not a cogent one; because "more" or "less" diversify dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, not as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but as to the determination of its measure. In like manner the liquid added can be so small as on that account to be hindered from permeating the whole, and not simply by the dimensions; which, although they are present without a subject, still they are opposed to another liquid, just as <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> would be if it were present, according to what was said at the beginning of the article.
