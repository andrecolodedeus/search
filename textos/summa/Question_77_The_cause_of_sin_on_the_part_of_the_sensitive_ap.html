<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the will is moved by a passion of the senstive appetite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not moved by a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. For no passive power is moved except by its object. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a power both passive and active, inasmuch as it is mover and moved, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power in general (De Anima iii, text. 54). Since therefore the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> defined by the reason, it seems that a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> does not move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the higher mover is not moved by the lower; thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not moved by the body. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, is compared to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as a higher mover to a lower: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, text. 57) that "the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> moves the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, even as, in the heavenly bodies, one sphere moves another." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be moved by a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing immaterial can be moved by that which is material. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is an immaterial power, because it does not use a corporeal organ, since it is in the reason, as stated in De Anima iii, text. 42: whereas the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a material force, since it is seated in an organ of the body. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> cannot move the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/dan013.htm#verse56">Daniel 13:56</a>): "Lust hath perverted thy heart."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A passion of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> cannot draw or move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> directly; but it can do so indirectly, and this in two ways. First, by a kind of distraction: because, since all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers are rooted in the one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that, when one power is intent in its act, another power becomes remiss, or is even altogether impeded, in its act, both because all energy is weakened through being divided, so that, on the contrary, through being centered on one thing, it is less able to be directed to several; and because, in the operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, a certain attention is requisite, and if this be closely fixed on one thing, less attention is given to another. In this way, by a kind of distraction, when the movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is enforced in respect of any passion whatever, the proper movement of the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or will must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, become remiss or altogether impeded.

<p>Secondly, this may happen on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> object, which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apprehended by reason. Because the judgment and apprehension of reason is impeded on account of a vehement and inordinate apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and judgment of the estimative power, as appears in those who are out of their mind. Now it is evident that the apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and the judgment of the estimative power follow the passion of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, even as the verdict of the taste follows the disposition of the tongue: for which reason we observe that those who are in some kind of passion, do not easily turn their <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> away from the object of their emotion, the result being that the judgment of the reason often follows the passion of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and consequently the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> movement follows it also, since it has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination always to follow the judgment of the reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the passion of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not the direct object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, yet it occasions a certain change in the judgment about the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The higher mover is not directly moved by the lower; but, in a manner, it can be moved by it indirectly, as stated.

<p>The Third Objection is solved in like manner.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the reason can be overcome by a passion, against its knowledge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the reason cannot be overcome by a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, against its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For the stronger is not overcome by the weaker. Now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, on account of its <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a>, is the strongest thing in us. Therefore it cannot be overcome by a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, which is weak and soon passes away.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not directed save to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or the apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now when a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> draws the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to that which is really <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it does not influence the reason against its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and when it draws it to that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apparently, but not really, it draws it to that which appears <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the reason. But what appears to the reason is in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the reason. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> never influences the reason against its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if it be said that it draws the reason from its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of something in general, to form a contrary judgment about a particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>--on the contrary, if a universal and a particular proposition be opposed, they are opposed by contradiction, e.g. "Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," and "Not every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Now if two opinions contradict one another, they are contrary to one another, as stated in Peri Herm. ii. If therefore anyone, while <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> something in general, were to pronounce an opposite judgment in a particular case, he would have two contrary opinions at the same time, which is impossible.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whoever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the universal, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also the particular which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be contained in the universal: thus who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that every mule is sterile, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that this particular animal is sterile, provided he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it to be a mule, as is clear from Poster. i, text. 2. Now he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> something in general, e.g. that "no fornication is lawful," <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> this general proposition to contain, for example, the particular proposition, "This is an act of fornication." Therefore it seems that his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> extends to the particular.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Peri Herm. i), "words express the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>." Now it often happens that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, while in a state of passion, confesses that what he has chosen is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, even in that particular case. Therefore he has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, even in particular.

<p>Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> cannot draw the reason against its universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; because it is impossible for it to have universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> together with an opposite particular judgment.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans 7:23</a>): "I see another <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in my members, fighting against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of my mind, and captivating me in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that is in the members is <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, of which he had been speaking previously. Since then <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, it seems that a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> draws the reason counter to its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. vii, 2), the opinion of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> was that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> can never be overcome by passion; wherefore he held every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be a kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> a kind of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. In this he was somewhat right, because, since the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or an apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is never moved to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, unless that which is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> appear <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in some respect to the reason; so that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> would never tend to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, unless there were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in the reason. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse22">Proverbs 14:22</a>): "They <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> that work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<p>Experience, however, shows that many act contrary to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that they have, and this is confirmed by Divine authority, according to the words of <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse47">Luke 12:47</a>: "The servant who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his lord . . . and did not . . . shall be beaten with many stripes," and of <a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse17">James 4:17</a>: "To him . . . who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and doth it not, to him it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Consequently he was not altogether right, and it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 3) to make a distinction. Because, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to right action by a twofold <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, viz. universal and particular, a defect in either of them suffices to hinder the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, as stated above (Question 76, Article 1). It may happen, then, that a man has some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in general, e.g. that no fornication is lawful, and yet he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in particular that this act, which is fornication, must not be done; and this suffices for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> not to follow the universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the reason. Again, it must be observed that nothing prevents a thing which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> from not being considered actually: so that it is possible for a man to have correct <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> not only in general but also in particular, and yet not to consider his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> actually: and in such a case it does not seem difficult for a man to act counter to what he does not actually consider. Now, that a man sometimes fails to consider in particular what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>, may happen through mere lack of attention: for instance, a man who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> geometry, may not attend to the consideration of geometrical conclusions, which he is ready to consider at any moment. Sometimes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> fails to consider actually what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>, on account of some hindrance supervening, e.g. some external occupation, or some bodily infirmity; and, in this way, a man who is in a state of passion, fails to consider in particular what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> in general, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> hinder him from considering it. Now it hinders him in three ways. First, by way of distraction, as explained above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Secondly, by way of opposition, because a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> often inclines to something contrary to what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> in general. Thirdly, by way of bodily transmutation, the result of which is that the reason is somehow fettered so as not to exercise its act freely; even as sleep or drunkenness, on account of some change wrought on the body, fetters the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. That this takes place in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> is evident from the fact that sometimes, when the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are very intense, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loses the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> altogether: for many have gone out of their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> through excess of love or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. It is in this way that passion draws the reason to judge in particular, against the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which it has in general.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is most certain, does not hold the foremost place in action, but rather particular <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, since actions are about singulars: wherefore it is not astonishing that, in matters of action, passion acts counter to universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, if the consideration of particular <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> be lacking.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The fact that something appears <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in particular to the reason, whereas it is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is due to a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>: and yet this particular judgment is contrary to the universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is impossible for anyone to have an actual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion about a universal affirmative proposition, and at the same time a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion about a particular negative proposition, or vice versa: but it may well happen that a man has <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about a universal affirmative proposition, and actually a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion about a particular negative: because an act is directly opposed, not to a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but to an act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> He that has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in a universal, is hindered, on account of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, from reasoning about that universal, so as to draw the conclusion: but he reasons about another universal proposition suggested by the inclination of the passion, and draws his conclusion accordingly. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 3) that the syllogism of an incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has four propositions, two particular and two universal, of which one is of the reason, e.g. No fornication is lawful, and the other, of passion, e.g. Pleasure is to be pursued. Hence passion fetters the reason, and hinders it from arguing and concluding under the first proposition; so that while the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> lasts, the reason argues and concludes under the second.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Even as a <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunken</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sometimes gives utterance to words of deep signification, of which, however, he is incompetent to judge, his drunkenness hindering him; so that a man who is in a state of passion, may indeed say in words that he ought not to do so and so, yet his inner thought is that he must do it, as stated in Ethic. vii, 3.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a sin committed through passion, should be called a sin of weakness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through passion should not be called a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of weakness. For a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> is a vehement movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now vehemence of movements is evidence of strength rather than of weakness. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through passion, should not be called a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of weakness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, weakness in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> regards that which is most fragile in him. Now this is the flesh; whence it is written (<a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse39">Psalm 77:39</a>): "He remembered that they are flesh." Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of weakness should be those which result from bodily defects, rather than those which are due to a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not seem to be weak in respect of things which are subject to his will. Now it is subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will, whether he do or do not the things to which his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> incline him, according to <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse7">Genesis 4:7</a>: "Thy <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> shall be under thee [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'The <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> thereof shall be under thee.'], and thou shalt have dominion over it." Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through passion is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of weakness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Cicero (De Quaest. Tusc. iv) calls the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> diseases of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now weakness is another name for disease. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that arises from passion should be called a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of weakness.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in which, chiefly, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> resides. Now weakness may be applied to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by way of likeness to weakness of the body. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body is said to be weak, when it is disabled or hindered in the execution of its proper action, through some disorder of the body's parts, so that the humors and members of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body cease to be subject to its governing and motive power. Hence a member is said to be weak, when it cannot do the work of a healthy member, the eye, for instance, when it cannot see clearly, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (De Hist. Animal. x, 1). Therefore weakness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is hindered from fulfilling its proper action on account of a disorder in its parts. Now as the parts of the body are said to be out of order, when they fail to comply with the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so too the parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are said to be inordinate, when they are not subject to the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, for the reason is the ruling power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> parts. Accordingly, when the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> or irascible power is affected by any passion contrary to the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, the result being that an impediment arises in the aforesaid manner to the due action of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it is said to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of weakness. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 8) compares the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to an epileptic, whose limbs move in a manner contrary to his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as in the body the stronger the movement against the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the greater the weakness, so likewise, the stronger the movement of passion against the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, the greater the weakness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sin consists chiefly in an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is not hindered by weakness of the body: for he that is weak in body may have a will ready for action, and yet be hindered by a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Hence when we speak of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of weakness, we refer to weakness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rather than of body. And yet even weakness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is called weakness of the flesh, in so far as it is owing to a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the flesh that the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> arise in us through the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> being a power using a corporeal organ.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> power to give or refuse its consent to what passion inclines us to do, and it is in this sense that our <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is said to be under us; and yet this consent or dissent of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is hindered in the way already explained (1).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether self-love is the source of every sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that self-love is not the source of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and right in itself is not the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now love of self is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and right thing in itself: wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is commanded to love his neighbor as himself (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus 19:18</a>). Therefore self-love cannot be the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse8">Romans 7:8</a>): "Sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>"; on which words a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since by forbidding <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, it forbids all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>," the reason for which is that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is a distinct passion from love, as stated above (3, 2; 23, 4). Therefore self-love is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in commenting on <a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse17">Psalm 79:17</a>, "Things set on fire and dug down," says that "every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is due either to love arousing us to undue ardor or to fear inducing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>." Therefore self-love is not the only <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> at times through inordinate love of self, so does he sometimes through inordinate love of his neighbor. Therefore self-love is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 28) that "self-love, amounting to contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, builds up the city of Babylon." Now every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a citizen of Babylon. Therefore self-love is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 75, Article 1), the proper and direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to be considered on the part of the adherence to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; in which respect every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act proceeds from inordinate desire for some temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now the fact that anyone desires a temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> inordinately, is due to the fact that he loves himself inordinately; for to wish anyone some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to love him. Therefore it is evident that inordinate love of self is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Well ordered self-love, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires a fitting <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for himself, is right and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>; but it is inordinate self-love, leading to contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xiv, 28) reckons to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Concupiscence, whereby a man desires <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for himself, is reduced to self-love as to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is said to love both the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he desires for himself, and himself to whom he desires it. Love, in so far as it is directed to the object of desire (e.g. a man is said to love wine or money) admits, as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, fear which pertains to avoidance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: for every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> arises either from inordinate desire for some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or from inordinate avoidance of some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But each of these is reduced to self-love, since it is through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> himself that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> either desires <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, or avoids <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A friend is like another self (Ethic. ix): wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is committed through love for a friend, seems to be committed through self-love.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether concupiscence of the flesh, concupiscence of the eyes, and pride of life are fittingly described as causes of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes, and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life" are unfittingly described as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Because, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1 Timothy 6:10</a>), "<a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'The desire of money'] is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life is not included in <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Therefore it should not be reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh is aroused chiefly by what is seen by the eyes, according to <a href="../bible/dan013.htm#verse56">Daniel 13:56</a>: "Beauty hath deceived thee." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes should not be condivided with <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is desire for pleasure, as stated above (Question 30, Article 2). Now objects of pleasure are perceived not only by the sight, but also by the other senses. Therefore "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the hearing" and of the other senses should also have been mentioned.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is induced to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through inordinate desire of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, so is he also, through inordinate avoidance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, as stated above (4, ad 3). But nothing is mentioned here pertaining to avoidance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are insufficiently described.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse16">1 John 2:16</a>): "All that is in the world is <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh, or [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'and'] <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life." Now a thing is said to be "in the world" by reason of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse19">1 John 5:19</a>): "The whole world is seated in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>." Therefore these three are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), inordinate self-love is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now self-love includes inordinate desire of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for a man desires <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the one he loves. Hence it is evident that inordinate desire of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is, in two ways, the object of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, wherein are the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: first, absolutely, according as it is the object of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part; secondly, under the aspect of difficulty, according as it is the object of the irascible part, as stated above (Question 23, Article 1). Again, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is twofold, as stated above (Question 30, Article 3). One is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and is directed to those things which sustain the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body, whether as regards the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, such as food, drink, and the like, or as regards the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, such as sexual matters: and the inordinate <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of such things is called "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh." The other is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, and is directed to those things which do not afford sustentation or pleasure in respect of the fleshly senses, but are delectable in respect of the apprehension or <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, or some similar mode of perception; such are money, apparel, and the like; and this <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is called "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes," whether this be taken as referring to the sight itself, of which the eyes are the organ, so as to denote curiosity according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> exposition (Confess. x); or to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of things which are proposed outwardly to the eyes, so as to denote <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, according to the explanation of others.

<p>The inordinate <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of the arduous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pertains to the "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life"; for <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the inordinate <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of excellence, as we shall state further on (84, 2; II-II, 162, 1).

<p>It is therefore evident that all <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that are a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be reduced to these three: since all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part can be reduced to the first two, and all the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> to the third, which is not divided into two because all the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> conform to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "Pride of life" is included in <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> according as the latter denotes any kind of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for any kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. How <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, as a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, which goes by the name of "avarice," is the root of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, shall be explained further on (84, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> "Concupiscence of the eyes" does not mean here the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> for all things which can be seen by the eyes, but only for such things as afford, not carnal pleasure in respect of touch, but in respect of the eyes, i.e. of any apprehensive power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The sense of sight is the most excellent of all the senses, and covers a larger ground, as stated in Metaph. i: and so its name is transferred to all the other senses, and even to the inner apprehensions, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Verb. Dom., serm. xxxiii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Avoidance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (25, 2; 39, 2); and so those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> alone are mentioned which incline to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of those which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> inordinately the avoidance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether sin is alleviated on account of a passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not alleviated on account of passion. For increase of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> adds to the effect: thus if a hot thing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> something to melt, a hotter will do so yet more. Now passion is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated (5). Therefore the more intense the passion, the greater the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore passion does not diminish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but increases it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> passion stands in the same relation to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> passion does to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> passion increases <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>: for a man seems to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the more, according as he is moved by a greater pity to help a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> passion also increases rather than diminishes a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man seems to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the more grievously, according as he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with a more intense will. But the passion that impels the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> makes it tend with greater intensity to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act. Therefore passion aggravates a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The passion of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is called a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of the flesh. But the greater the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> that overcomes a man, the less grievous his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Civ. Dei iv, 12).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sin consists <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in an act of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, which is a faculty of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and reason; while passion is a movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> can be related to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, antecedently and consequently: antecedently, according as a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> draws or inclines the reason or will, as stated above (1,2; 10, 3); and consequently, in so far as the movements of the higher powers redound on to the lower, since it is not possible for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to be moved to anything intensely, without a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> being aroused in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p>Accordingly if we take passion as preceding the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, it must needs diminish the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because the act is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, and under our control. Now a thing is said to be under our control, through the reason and will: and therefore the more the reason and will do anything of their own accord, and not through the impulse of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, the more is it <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and under our control. In this respect passion diminishes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as it diminishes its voluntariness.

<p>On the other hand, a consequent passion does not diminish a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but increases it; or rather it is a sign of its gravity, in so far, to wit, as it shows the intensity of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act; and so it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the greater the pleasure or the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> with which anyone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the greater the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on the part of that to which the sinner turns. But the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is measured on the part of that from which he turns, which results <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> from his turning to something else--<a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, i.e. beside his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Now an effect is increased by the increase, not of its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but of its direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> passion consequent to the judgment of reason increases <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; but if it precede, so that a man is moved to do well, rather by his passion than by the judgment of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, such a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> diminishes the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and praiseworthiness of his action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> incited by the passion is more intense, yet it is not so much the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> own movement, as if it were moved to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the reason alone.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether passion excuses from sin altogether?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that passion excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether. For whatever <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an act to be involuntary, excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether. But <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh, which is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, makes an act to be involuntary, according to <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians 5:17</a>: "The flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusteth</a> against the spirit . . . so that you do not the things that you would." Therefore passion excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, passion <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a certain <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of a particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as stated above (2; 76, 3). But <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of a particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether, as stated above (Question 6, Article 8). Therefore passion excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, disease of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is graver than disease of the body. But bodily disease excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether, as in the case of mad people. Much more, therefore, does passion, which is a disease of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse5">Romans 7:5</a>) speaks of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as "<a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," for no other reason than that they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: which would not be the case if they excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether. Therefore passion does not excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An act which, in its genus, is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, cannot be excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether, unless it be rendered altogether involuntary. Consequently, if the passion be such that it renders the subsequent act wholly involuntary, it entirely excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; otherwise, it does not excuse entirely. In this matter two points apparently should be observed: first, that a thing may be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> either "in itself," as when the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends towards it directly; or "in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>," when the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends towards that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and not towards the effect; as is the case with one who wilfully gets drunk, for in that case he is considered to do <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> whatever he does through being drunk. Secondly, we must observe that a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> "directly" or "indirectly"; directly, if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends towards it; indirectly, if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> could have prevented it, but did not.

<p>Accordingly therefore we must make a distinction: because a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> is sometimes so strong as to take away the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> altogether, as in the case of those who are mad through love or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and then if such a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> were <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> from the beginning, the act is reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as we have stated with regard to drunkenness. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> but <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, for instance, if anyone through sickness or some such <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> fall into such a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> as deprives him of the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, his act is rendered wholly involuntary, and he is entirely excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Sometimes, however, the passion is not such as to take away the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> altogether; and then reason can drive the passion away, by turning to other thoughts, or it can prevent it from having its full effect; since the members are not put to work, except by the consent of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated above (Question 17, Article 9): wherefore such a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> does not excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words, "So that you do not the things that you would" are not to be referred to outward deeds, but to the inner movement of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; for a man would wish never to desire <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in which sense we are to understand the words of <a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse19">Romans 7:19</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which I <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> not, that I do." Or again they may be referred to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as preceding the passion, as is the case with the incontinent, who act counter to their resolution on account of their <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The particular <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which excuses altogether, is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of a circumstance, which a man is unable to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even after taking due precautions. But passion <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in a particular case, by preventing universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from being applied to a particular act, which passion the reason is able to drive away, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Bodily disease is involuntary: there would be a comparison, however, if it were <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as we have stated about drunkenness, which is a kind of bodily disease.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether a sin committed through passion can be mortal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through passion cannot be mortal. Because venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is condivided with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed from weakness is venial, since it has in itself a motive for pardon [venia]. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through passion is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of weakness, it seems that it cannot be mortal.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is more powerful than its effect. But passion cannot be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for there is no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the sensuality, as stated above (Question 74, Article 4). Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through passion cannot be mortal.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, passion is a hindrance to reason, as explained above (1,2). Now it belongs to the reason to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or to turn away from Him, which is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through passion cannot be mortal.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse5">Romans 7:5</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> . . . work [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'did work'] in our members to bring forth fruit unto death." Now it is proper to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to bring forth fruit unto death. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through passion may be mortal.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 72, Article 5), consists in turning away from our last end which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which aversion pertains to the deliberating reason, whose function it is also to direct towards the end. Therefore that which is contrary to the last end can happen not to be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, only when the deliberating reason is unable to come to the rescue, which is the case in sudden movements. Now when anyone proceeds from passion to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, or to a deliberate consent, this does not happen suddenly: and so the deliberating reason can come to the rescue here, since it can drive the passion away, or at least prevent it from having its effect, as stated above: wherefore if it does not come to the rescue, there is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and it is thus, as we see, that many murders and adulteries are committed through passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be venial in three ways. First, through its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, i.e. through having <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be forgiven, which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> lessens the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; thus a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is committed through weakness or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is said to be venial. Secondly, through its issue; thus every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through repentance, becomes venial, i.e. receives pardon [veniam]. Thirdly, by its genus, e.g. an idle word. This is the only kind of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is opposed to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: whereas the objection regards the first kind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as regards the adherence to something. But that this be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> regards the aversion, which follows <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> from the adherence, as stated above (6, ad 1): hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> does not always hinder the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> altogether: consequently the reason remains in possession of its <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, so as to turn away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or turn to Him. If, however, the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> be taken away altogether, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is no longer either mortal or venial.
