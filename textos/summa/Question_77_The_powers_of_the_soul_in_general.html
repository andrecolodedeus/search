<h1>Question 77. The powers of the soul in general</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1077.htm#article1"> Is the essence of the soul its power?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1077.htm#article2"> Is there one power of the soul, or several?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1077.htm#article3"> How are the powers of the soul distinguished from one another?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1077.htm#article4"> The orders of the powers, one to another</a> <li><a href="../summa/1077.htm#article5"> Are the powers of the soul in it as in their subject?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1077.htm#article6"> Do the powers flow from the essence of the soul?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1077.htm#article7"> Does one power rise from another?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1077.htm#article8"> Do all the powers of the soul remain in the soul after death?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the essence of the soul is its power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is its power. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ix, 4), that "mind, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and love are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> substantially, or, which is the same thing, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>": and (De Trin. x, 11), that "<a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, understanding, and will are one life, one mind, one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is nobler than primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is its own <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Much more therefore is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> its own power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form is simpler than the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form; a sign of which is that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form is not intensified or relaxed, but is indivisible. But the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form is its own power. Much more therefore is that <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form which is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, we sense by the sensitive power and we understand by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power. But "that by which we first sense and understand" is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, 2). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is its own power.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, whatever does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Therefore if the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is something else besides the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> thereof, it is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, who says that the foregoing (see Objection 1) "are not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as in a subject as color or shape, or any other <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, are in a body; for whatever is so, does not exceed the subject in which it is: Whereas the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> can love and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> other things" (De Trin. ix, 4).

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, " a simple form cannot be a subject." But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a simple form; since it is not composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, as we have said above (Question 75, Article 5). Therefore the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be in it as in a subject.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is not the principle of a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> difference. But sensitive and rational are <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> differences; and they are taken from sense and reason, which are powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>; and so it would seem that the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. xi) says that "heavenly spirits are divided into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, power, and operation." Much more, then, in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> distinct from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible to admit that the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, although some have maintained it. For the present purpose this may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in two ways.

<p>First, because, since power and act divide being and every kind of being, we must refer a power and its act to the same genus. Therefore, if the act be not in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, the power directed to that act cannot be in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Now the operation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; for this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, whose operation is His own <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Wherefore the Divine power which is the principle of His operation is the Divine Essence itself. This cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> either of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or of any creature; as we have said above when speaking of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (54, 3).

<p>Secondly, this may be also shown to be impossible in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by its very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is an act. Therefore if the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were the immediate principle of operation, whatever has a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would always have actual vital actions, as that which has a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is always an actually living thing. For as a form the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not an act ordained to a further act, but the ultimate term of generation. Wherefore, for it to be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to another act, does not belong to it according to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as a form, but according to its power. So the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, as the subject of its power, is called the first act, with a further relation to the second act. Now we observe that what has a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not always actual with respect to its vital operations; whence also it is said in the definition of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that it is "the act of a body having life <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>"; which <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, however, "does not exclude the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Therefore it follows that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not its power. For nothing is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> by reason of an act, as act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> as it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and loves itself. Thus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love as referred to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and loved, are substantially or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and loved. In the same way are we to understand what he says in the other passage, that those things are "one life, one mind, one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>." Or, as some say, this passage is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the sense in which the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> whole is predicated of its parts, being midway between the universal whole, and the integral whole. For the universal whole is in each part according to its entire <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and power; as animal in a man and in a horse; and therefore it is properly predicated of each part. But the integral whole is not in each part, neither according to its whole <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, nor according to its whole power. Therefore in no way can it be predicated of each part; yet in a way it is predicated, though improperly, of all the parts together; as if we were to say that the wall, roof, and foundations are a house. But the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> whole is in each part according to its whole <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, not, however, according to its whole power. Therefore in a way it can be predicated of each part, but not so properly as the universal whole. In this sense, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, understanding, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> are the one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The act to which primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is nothing else but its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Action belongs to the composite, as does <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; for to act belongs to what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. Now the composite has <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> through the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form; and it operates by the power which results from the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form. Hence an active <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form is to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the agent (for instance, heat compared to the form of fire) as the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> That the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form is a principle of action is due to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form is the first principle of action; but not the proximate principle. In this sense the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is that whereby we understand and sense."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> If we take <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> as meaning what is divided against <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, then there can be no medium between <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; because they are divided by affirmation and negation, that is, according to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in a subject, and non-existence in a subject. In this sense, as the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it must be an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; and it belongs to the second <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. But if we take <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> as one of the five universals, in this sense there is a medium between <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is all that belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing; whereas whatever is beyond the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing cannot be called <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in this sense; but only what is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> principle of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For the 'proper' does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing, but is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> principles of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; wherefore it is a medium between the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> thus understood. In this sense the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be said to be a medium between <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, as being <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> properties of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. When <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love are not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> in a subject, this must be understood in the sense given above, inasmuch as they are compared to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, but as loved and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. His argument proceeds in this sense; for if love were in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> loved as in a subject, it would follow that an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> transcends its subject, since even other things are loved through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, yet it has an admixture of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, as we have said above (75, 5, ad 4); and for this reason it can be the subject of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. The statement quoted is verified in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the Pure Act; in treating of which subject <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> employs that phrase (De Trin. i).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> Rational and sensitive, as differences, are not taken from the powers of sense and reason, but from the sensitive and rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself. But because <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms, which in themselves are unknown to us, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>; nothing prevents us from sometimes substituting <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> for <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> differences.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there are several powers of the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are not several powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> approaches nearest to the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is one simple power: and therefore also in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the higher a power is, the more unified it is. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> excels all other forms in power. Therefore above all others it has one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to operate belongs to what is in act. But by the one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has actual <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the different degrees of perfection, as we have seen above (76, 3,4). Therefore by the one power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> he performs operations of various degrees.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> places several powers in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (De Anima ii, 2,3).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> we must place several powers in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. To make this evident, we observe that, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Coelo ii, 12), the lowest order of things cannot acquire perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, but they acquire a certain imperfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, by few movements; and those which belong to a higher order acquire perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> by many movements; and those yet higher acquire perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> by few movements; and the highest perfection is found in those things which acquire perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> without any movement whatever. Thus he is least of all disposed of health, who can only acquire imperfect health by means of a few remedies; better disposed is he who can acquire perfect health by means of many remedies; and better still, he who can by few remedies; best of all is he who has perfect health without any remedies. We conclude, therefore, that things which are below <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquire a certain limited <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; and so they have a few determinate operations and powers. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can acquire universal and perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, because he can acquire beatitude. Yet he is in the last degree, according to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, of those to whom beatitude is possible; therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> requires many and various operations and powers. But to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> a smaller variety of powers is sufficient. In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no power or action beyond His own Essence.

<p>There is yet another reason why the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> abounds in a variety of powers--because it is on the confines of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and corporeal creatures; and therefore the powers of both meet together in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> approaches to the Divine likeness, more than inferior creatures, in being able to acquire perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; although by many and various means; and in this it falls short of more perfect creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A unified power is superior if it extends to equal things: but a multiform power is superior to it, if it is over many things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One thing has one <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but may have several operations. So there is one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, with several powers.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the powers are distinguished by their acts and objects?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are not distinguished by acts and objects. For nothing is determined to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by what is subsequent and extrinsic to it. But the act is subsequent to the power; and the object is extrinsic to it. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers are not specifically distinct by acts and objects.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, contraries are what differ most from each other. Therefore if the powers are distinguished by their objects, it follows that the same power could not have contrary objects. This is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in almost all the powers; for the power of vision extends to white and black, and the power to taste to sweet and bitter.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be removed, the effect is removed. Hence if the difference of powers came from the difference of objects, the same object would not come under different powers. This is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; for the same thing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the cognitive power, and desired by the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, that which of itself is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of anything, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof, wherever it is. But various objects which belong to various powers, belong also to some one power; as sound and color belong to sight and hearing, which are different powers, yet they come under the one power of <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a>. Therefore the powers are not distinguished according to the difference of their objects.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Things that are subsequent are distinguished by what precedes. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 4) that "acts and operations precede the powers according to reason; and these again are preceded by their opposites," that is their objects. Therefore the powers are distinguished according to their acts and objects.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A power as such is directed to an act. Wherefore we seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a power from the act to which it is directed, and consequently the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a power is diversified, as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the act is diversified. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an act is diversified according to the various natures of the objects. For every act is either of an active power or of a passive power. Now, the object is to the act of a passive power, as the principle and moving <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: for color is the principle of vision, inasmuch as it moves the sight. On the other hand, to the act of an active power the object is a term and end; as the object of the power of growth is perfect <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, which is the end of growth. Now, from these two things an act receives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, namely, from its principle, or from its end or term; for the act of heating differs from the act of cooling, in this, that the former proceeds from something hot, which is the active principle, to heat; the latter from something cold, which is the active principle, to cold. Therefore the powers are of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> distinguished by their acts and objects.

<p>Nevertheless, we must observe that things which are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> do not change the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For since to be colored is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to an animal, its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is not changed by a difference of color, but by a difference in that which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an animal, that is to say, by a difference in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is sometimes rational, and sometimes otherwise. Hence "rational" and "irrational" are differences dividing animal, constituting its various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. In like manner therefore, not any variety of objects diversifies the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but a difference in that to which the power of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is directed. Thus the senses of their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are directed to the passive <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> which of itself is divided into color, sound, and the like, and therefore there is one sensitive power with regard to color, namely, the sight, and another with regard to sound, namely, hearing. But it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to a passive <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, for instance, to something colored, to be a musician or a grammarian, great or small, a man or a stone. Therefore by reason of such differences the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are not distinct.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Act, though subsequent in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to power, is, nevertheless, prior to it in <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>; as the end is with regard to the agent. And the object, although extrinsic, is, nevertheless, the principle or end of the action; and those <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> which are intrinsic to a thing, are proportionate to its principle and end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If any power were to have one of two contraries as such for its object, the other contrary would belong to another power. But the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not regard the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the contrary as such, but rather the common aspect of both contraries; as sight does not regard white as such, but as color. This is because of two contraries one, in a manner, includes the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the other, since they are to one another as perfect and imperfect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing prevents things which coincide in subject, from being considered under different aspects; therefore they can belong to various powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The higher power of itself regards a more universal formality of the object than the lower power; because the higher a power is, to a greater number of things does it extend. Therefore many things are combined in the one formality of the object, which the higher power considers of itself; while they differ in the formalities regarded by the lower powers of themselves. Thus it is that various objects belong to various lower powers; which objects, however, are subject to one higher power.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether among the powers of the soul there is order?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no order among the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For in those things which come under one division, there is no before and after, but all are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> simultaneous. But the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are contradistinguished from one another. Therefore there is no order among them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are referred to their objects and to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself. On the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, there is not order among them, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is one. In like manner the objects are various and dissimilar, as color and sound. Therefore there is no order among the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, where there is order among powers, we find that the operation of one depends on the operation of another. But the action of one power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not depend on that of another; for sight can act independently of hearing, and conversely. Therefore there is no order among the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, 3) compares the parts or powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to figures. But figures have an order among themselves. Therefore the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> have order.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is one, and the powers are many; and since a number of things that proceed from one must proceed in a certain order; there must be some order among the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Accordingly we may observe a triple order among them, two of which correspond to the dependence of one power on another; while the third is taken from the order of the objects. Now the dependence of one power on another can be taken in two ways; according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, forasmuch as perfect things are by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> prior to imperfect things; and according to the order of generation and time; forasmuch as from being imperfect, a thing comes to be perfect. Thus, according to the first kind of order among the powers, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> powers are prior to the sensitive powers; wherefore they direct them and command them. Likewise the sensitive powers are prior in this order to the powers of the nutritive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>In the second kind of order, it is the other way about. For the powers of the nutritive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are prior by way of generation to the powers of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for which, therefore, they prepare the body. The same is to be said of the sensitive powers with regard to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. But in the third kind of order, certain sensitive powers are ordered among themselves, namely, sight, hearing, and smelling. For the visible <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> comes first; since it is common to higher and lower bodies. But sound is audible in the air, which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to the mingling of elements, of which smell is the result.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a given genus are to one another as before and after, like numbers and figures, if considered in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; although they may be said to be simultaneous, according as they receive the predication of the common genus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This order among the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is both on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (which, though it be one according to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, has a certain aptitude to various acts in a certain order) and on the part of the objects, and furthermore on the part of the acts, as we have said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument is verified as regards those powers among which order of the third kind <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. Those powers among which the two other kinds of order <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> are such that the action of one depends on another.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether all the powers of the soul are in the soul as their subject?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as their subject. For as the powers of the body are to the body; so are the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the body is the subject of the corporeal powers. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the subject of the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the operations of the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are attributed to the body by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; because, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 2), "The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is that by which we sense and understand primarily." But the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles of the operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are the powers. Therefore the powers are primarily in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 7,24) that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> senses certain things, not through the body, in fact, without the body, as fear and such like; and some things through the body. But if the sensitive powers were not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone as their subject, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could not sense anything without the body. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the subject of the sensitive powers; and for a similar reason, of all the other powers.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Somno et Vigilia i) that "sensation belongs neither to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nor to the body, but to the composite." Therefore the sensitive power is in "the composite" as its subject. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone is not the subject of all the powers.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The subject of operative power is that which is able to operate, for every <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> denominates its proper subject. Now the same is that which is able to operate, and that which does operate. Wherefore the "subject of power" is of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> "the subject of operation," as again the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in the beginning of De Somno et Vigilia. Now, it is clear from what we have said above (75, 2,3; 76, 1, ad 1), that some operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are performed without a corporeal organ, as understanding and will. Hence the powers of these operations are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as their subject. But some operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are performed by means of corporeal organs; as sight by the eye, and hearing by the ear. And so it is with all the other operations of the nutritive and sensitive parts. Therefore the powers which are the principles of these operations have their subject in the composite, and not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All the powers are said to belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not as their subject, but as their principle; because it is by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that the composite has the power to perform such operations.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All such powers are primarily in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as compared to the composite; not as in their subject, but as in their principle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> opinion was that sensation is an operation proper to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, just as understanding is. Now in many things relating to Philosophy <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> makes use of the opinions of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, not asserting them as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but relating them. However, as far as the present question is concerned, when it is said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> senses some things with the body, and some without the body, this can be taken in two ways.

<p>Firstly, the words "with the body or without the body" may determine the act of sense in its mode of proceeding from the sentient. Thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> senses nothing without the body, because the action of sensation cannot proceed from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> except by a corporeal organ.

<p>Secondly, they may be understood as determining the act of sense on the part of the object sensed. Thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> senses some things with the body, that is, things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the body, as when it feels a wound or something of that sort; while it senses some things without the body, that is, which do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the body, but only in the apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as when it feels sad or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyful</a> on hearing something.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the powers of the soul flow from its essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> do not flow from its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For different things do not proceed from one simple thing. But the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is one and simple. Since, therefore, the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are many and various, they cannot proceed from its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that from which a thing proceeds is its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be said to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the powers; as is clear if one considers the different kinds of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Therefore the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> do not flow from its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, emanation involves some sort of movement. But nothing is moved by itself, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. vii, 1,2); except, perhaps, by reason of a part of itself, as an animal is said to be moved by itself, because one part thereof moves and another is moved. Neither is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> moved, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (De Anima i, 4). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not produce its powers within itself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> properties. But the subject is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>; whence also it is included in the definition of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, as is clear from Metaph. vii (Did. vi, 4). Therefore the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> proceed from its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> as their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form partly agree and partly differ. They agree in this, that each is an act; and that by each of them something is after a manner actual. They differ, however, in two respects.

<p>First, because the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form makes a thing to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> absolutely, and its subject is something purely <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form does not make a thing to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> absolutely but to be such, or so great, or in some particular <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>; for its subject is an actual being. Hence it is clear that <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> is observed in the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form prior to its being observed in the subject: and since that which is first in a genus is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in that genus, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in its subject. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> is observed in the subject of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form prior to its being observed in the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> of the subject. So the subject, forasmuch as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, is receptive of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form: but forasmuch as it is in act, it produces it. This I say of the proper and "per se" <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; for with regard to the extraneous <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, the subject is receptive only, the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> being <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an extrinsic agent.

<p>Secondly, <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> forms differ, because, since that which is the less principal <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> for the sake of that which is the more principal, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> therefore <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form; while on the contrary, the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> on account of the completeness of the subject.

<p>Now it is clear, from what has been said (5), that either the subject of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself alone, which can be the subject of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, forasmuch as it has something of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, as we have said above (1, ad 6); or else this subject is the composite. Now the composite is actual by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Whence it is clear that all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whether their subject be the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, or the composite, flow from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as from their principle; because it has already been said that the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the subject according as it is actual, and is received into it according as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> From one simple thing many things may proceed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, in a certain order; or again if there be diversity of recipients. Thus, from the one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> many and various powers proceed; both because order <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> among these powers; and also by reason of the diversity of the corporeal organs.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The subject is both the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and in a way the active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, of its proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. It is also as it were the material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, inasmuch as it is receptive of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. From this we may gather that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all its powers, as their end, and as their active principle; and of some as receptive thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The emanation of proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> from their subject is not by way of transmutation, but by a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> resultance; thus one thing results <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> from another, as color from light.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether one power of the soul arises from another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not arise from another. For if several things arise together, one of them does not arise from another. But all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at the same time with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore one of them does not arise from another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> arises from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> from the subject. But one power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be the subject of another; because nothing is the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Therefore one power does not arise from another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one opposite does not arise from the other opposite; but everything arises from that which is like it in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are oppositely divided, as various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore one of them does not proceed from another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Powers are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their actions. But the action of one power is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the action of another power, as the action of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> by the action of the senses. Therefore one power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In those things which proceed from one according to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, as the first is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all, so that which is nearer to the first is, in a way, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of those which are more remote. Now it has been shown above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>) that among the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there are several kinds of order. Therefore one power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the medium of another. But since the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is compared to the powers both as a principle active and final, and as a receptive principle, either separately by itself, or together with the body; and since the agent and the end are more perfect, while the receptive principle, as such, is less perfect; it follows that those powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which precede the others, in the order of perfection and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, are the principles of the others, after the manner of the end and active principle. For we see that the senses are for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, and not the other way about. The senses, moreover, are a certain imperfect participation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>; wherefore, according to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> origin, they proceed from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> as the imperfect from the perfect. But considered as receptive principles, the more perfect powers are principles with regard to the others; thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according as it has the sensitive power, is considered as the subject, and as something material with regard to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>. On this account, the more imperfect powers precede the others in the order of generation, for the animal is generated before the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> flows from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, not by a transmutation, but by a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> resultance, and is simultaneous with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so is it the case with one power as regards another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> cannot of itself be the subject of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; but one <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is received prior to another into <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> prior to <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. In this sense one <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is said to be the subject of another; as surface is of color, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> receives an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> through the means of another. The same thing may be said of the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are opposed to one another, as perfect and imperfect; as also are the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of numbers and figures. But this opposition does not prevent the origin of one from another, because imperfect things <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> proceed from perfect things.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether all the powers remain in the soul when separated from the body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body. For we read in the book De Spiritu et Anima that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> withdraws from the body, taking with itself sense and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, reason and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, concupiscibility and irascibility."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> properties. But properties are always in that to which they belong; and are never separated from it. Therefore the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are in it even after death.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the powers even of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are not weakened when the body becomes weak; because, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima i, 4), "If an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were given the eye of a young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he would see even as well as a young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." But weakness is the road to corruption. Therefore the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are not corrupted when the body is corrupted, but remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is a power of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (De Memor. et Remin. 1). But <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> remains in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for it was said to the rich <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">glutton</a> whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>: "Remember that thou didst receive <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things during thy lifetime" (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse25">Luke 16:25</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> remains in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and consequently the other powers of the sensitive part.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sorrow are in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part, which is a power of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But it is clear that separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> grieve or rejoice at the pains or rewards which they receive. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power remains in the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 32) that, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when the body lies senseless, yet not quite dead, sees some things by <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision; so also when by death the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is quite separate from the body. But the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is a power of the sensitive part. Therefore the power of the sensitive part remains in the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and consequently all the other powers.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (De Eccl. Dogm. xix) that "of two <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> only does <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> consist; the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with its reason, and the body with its senses." Therefore the body being dead, the sensitive powers do not remain.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have said already (5,6,7), all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone as their principle. But some powers belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone as their subject; as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. These powers must remain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, after the destruction of the body. But other powers are subjected in the composite; as all the powers of the sensitive and nutritive parts. Now <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> cannot remain after the destruction of the subject. Wherefore, the composite being destroyed, such powers do not remain actually; but they remain virtually in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as in their principle or root.

<p>So it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that, as some say, these powers remain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> even after the corruption of the body. It is much more <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that, as they say also, the acts of these powers remain in the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; because these powers have no act apart from the corporeal organ.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That book has no authority, and so what is there written can be despised with the same facility as it was said; although we may say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> takes with itself these powers, not actually but virtually.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These powers, which we say do not actually remain in the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, are not the properties of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, but of the composite.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These powers are said not to be weakened when the body becomes weak, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remains unchangeable, and is the virtual principle of these powers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The recollection spoken of there is to be taken in the same way as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. x, 11; xiv, 7) places <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; not as a part of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> In the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, sorrow and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> are not in the sensitive, but in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in that passage is speaking as inquiring, not as asserting. Wherefore he retracted some things which he had said there (Retrac. ii, 24).
