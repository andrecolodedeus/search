<h1>Question 77. The time and manner of the resurrection</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5077.htm#article1"> Should the time of the resurrection be delayed until the end of the world?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5077.htm#article2"> Is that time hidden?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5077.htm#article3"> Will the resurrection occur at night-time?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5077.htm#article4"> Will it happen suddenly?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the time of our resurrection should be delayed till the end of the world?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the time of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> ought not to be delayed till the end of the world, so that all may rise together. For there is more conformity between head and members than between one member and another, as there is more between <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect than between one effect and another. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is our Head, did not delay His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> until the end of the world, so as to rise again together with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Therefore there is no need for the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of the early <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to be deferred until the end of the world, so that they may rise again together with the others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of the Head</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the members</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of certain members that desire nobility from their being closely connected with the Head was not delayed till the end of the world, but followed immediately after <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a>, as is piously <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the Evangelist</a> [Ep. de Assump. B.V., cap. ii, among <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> works]. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of others</a> will be so much nearer <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a>, according as they have been more conformed to Him by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the state of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is more perfect, and bears a closer resemblance to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, than the state of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Yet some of the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> rose again when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rose, according to <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse52">Matthew 27:52</a>: "Many of the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, that had slept, arose." Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> should not be delayed till the end of the world, so that all may rise together.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, there will be no numbering of years after the end of the world. Yet after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>, the years are still reckoned until the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of others, as appears from <a href="../bible/rev020.htm#verse4">Apocalypse 20:4-5</a>. For it is stated there that "I saw . . . the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of them that were beheaded for the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and for the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and further on: "And they lived and reigned with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a thousand years." And "the rest of the dead lived not till the thousand years were finished." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of all is not delayed until the end of the world, that all may <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise</a> together.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse12">Job 14:12</a>): "Man when he is fallen asleep shall not rise again till the heavens be broken, he shall not wake, nor rise out of his sleep," and it is a question of the sleep of death. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of men</a> will be delayed until the end of the world when the heavens shall be broken.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse39">Hebrews 11:39</a>): "All these being approved by the testimony of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> received not the promise," i.e. full beatitude of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, since "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has provided something better for us, lest they should be consummated," i.e. perfected, "without us--in order that," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes, "through all rejoicing each one might rejoice the more." But the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will not precede the glorification of bodies, because "He will reform the body of our lowness made like to the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>" (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a>), and the children of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will be "as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> . . . in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will be delayed till the end of the world, when all shall rise together.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Trin. iii, 4) "<a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> decreed that the grosser and lower bodies should be ruled in a certain order by the more subtle and powerful bodies": wherefore the entire <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the lower bodies is subject to variation according to the movement of the heavenly bodies. Hence it would be contrary to the order established in things by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> if the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of lower bodies were brought to the state of incorruption, so long as there remains movement in the higher bodies. And since, according to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will bring men to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life conformably to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who "rising again from the dead dieth now no more" (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse9">Romans 6:9</a>), the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of human bodies</a> will be delayed until the end of the world when the heavenly movement will cease. For this reason, too, certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who held that the movement of the heavens will never cease, maintained that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will return to mortal bodies such as we have now--whether, as Empedocles, they stated that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would return to the same body at the end of the great year, or that it would return to another body; thus <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoras</a> asserted that "any <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will enter any body," as stated in De Anima i, 3.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the head is more conformed to the members by conformity of proportion (which is requisite in order that it have influence over the members) than one member is to another, yet the head has a certain <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> over the members which the members have not; and in this the members differ from the head and agree with one another. Hence <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> is an exemplar of ours, and through our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> therein there arises in us the hope of our own <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of one of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> members is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of other members, and consequently <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> had to precede the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of others</a> who have all to rise again at the consummation of the world.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although among the members some rank higher than others and are more conformed to the Head, they do not attain to the character of headship so as to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of others. Consequently greater conformity to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not give them a right to rise again before others as though they were exemplar and the others exemplate, as we have said in reference to <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a>: and if it has been granted to others that their resurrection should not be delayed until the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">general resurrection</a>, this has been by special privilege of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and not as due on account of conformity to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Assumption</a> [Ep. x ad Paul. et Eustoch., now recognized as spurious], seems to be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> of this <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, namely as to whether, having been <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, they died again, so that theirs was a resuscitation (as in the case of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> who died again) rather than a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> such as will be at the end of the world--or really rose again to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life, to live for ever in the body, and to ascend bodily into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse52">Matthew 27:52</a>. The latter seems more probable, because, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says, in order that they might bear <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> witness to <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's true resurrection</a>, it was fitting that they should <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> rise again. Nor was their <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> hastened for their sake, but for the sake of bearing witness to <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a>: and that by bearing witness thereto they might lay the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>: wherefore it was more fitting that it should be borne by the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, than by those who died after the foundation of the New. It must, however, be observed that, although the Gospel mentions <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">their resurrection</a> before <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's</a>, we must take this statement as made in anticipation, as is often the case with writers of history. For none rose again with a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">true resurrection</a> before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since He is the "first-fruits of them that sleep" (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>), although some were resuscitated before <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a>, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> On account of these words, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> relates (De Civ. Dei xx, 7), certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> asserted that there will be a first <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> that they may reign with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on earth for a thousand years; whence they were called "chiliasts" or "millenarians." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xx, 7) that these words are to be understood otherwise, namely of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> resurrection, whereby men shall rise again from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: while the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">second resurrection</a> is of bodies. The reign of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> denotes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> wherein not only <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> but also the other elect reign, the part denoting the whole; or they reign with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as regards all, special mention being made of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, because they especially reign after death who fought for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, even unto death. The number of a thousand years denotes not a fixed number, but the whole of the present time wherein the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> now reign with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because the number 1,000 designates universality more than the number 100, since 100 is the square of 10, whereas 1,000 is a cube resulting from the multiplication of ten by its square, for 10 X 10 = 100, and 100 X 10 = 1,000. Again in <a href="../bible/psa104.htm#verse8">Psalm 104:8</a>, "The word which He commanded to a thousand," i.e. all, "generations."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the time of our resurrection is hidden?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this time is not hidden. Because when we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> exactly the beginning of a thing, we can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its end exactly, since "all things are measured by a certain period" (De Generat. ii). Now the beginning of the world is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> exactly. Therefore its end can also be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> exactly. But this will be the time of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> and judgment. Therefore that time is not hidden.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is stated (<a href="../bible/rev012.htm#verse6">Apocalypse 12:6</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who represents the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had a place prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that there she might feed [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'they should feed her'] a thousand two hundred sixty days." Again (<a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse11">Daniel 12:11</a>), a certain fixed number of days is mentioned, which apparently signify years, according to <a href="../bible/eze004.htm#verse6">Ezekiel 4:6</a>: "A day for a year, yea a day for a year I have appointed to thee." Therefore the time of the end of the world and of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> exactly from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the state of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> was foreshadowed in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> exactly the time wherein the state of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> endured. Therefore we can also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> exactly the time wherein the state of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> will endure. But the state of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> will last to the end of the world, wherefore it is said (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew 28:20</a>): "Behold I am with you . . . to the consummation of the world." Therefore the time of the end of the world and of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> exactly.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which is unknown to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will be much more unknown to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: because those things to which men attain by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> are much more clearly and certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Moreover <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelations</a> are not made to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> save by means of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> asserts (Coel. Hier. iv). Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have no exact <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that time, as appears from <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse36">Matthew 24:36</a>: "Of that day and hour no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>, no not the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Therefore that time is hidden from men.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were more cognizant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> secrets than others who followed them, because they had "the first-fruits of the spirit" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse23">Romans 8:23</a>)--" before others in point of time and more abundantly," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes. And yet when they questioned <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> about this very <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, He answered them (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse7">Acts 1:7</a>): "It is not for you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the times or moments which the Father hath put in His own power." Much more, therefore, is it hidden from others.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 58) "as to the last age of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, which begins from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> coming and lasts until the end of the world, it is uncertain of how many generations it will consist: even so old age, which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last age, has no fixed time according to the measure of the other ages, since sometimes alone it lasts as long a time as all the others." The reason of this is because the exact length of future time cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> except either by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> or by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: and the time until the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> cannot be reckoned by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> and the end of the heavenly movement will be simultaneous as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). And all things that are foreseen by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> to happen at a fixed time are reckoned by movement: and it is impossible from the movement of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to reckon its end, for since it is circular, it is for this very reason able by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to endure for ever: and consequently the time between this and the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> cannot be reckoned by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Again it cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, so that all may be on the watch and ready to meet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: and for this reason when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> asked Him about this, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> answered (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse7">Acts 1:7</a>): "It is not for you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the times or moments which the Father hath put in His own power," whereby, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xviii, 53): "He scatters the fingers of all calculators and bids them be still." For what He refused to tell the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, He will not reveal to others: wherefore all those who have been misled to reckon the aforesaid time have so far <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be untruthful; for some, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xviii, 53), stated that from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>'s <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> to His last coming 400 years would elapse, others 500, others 1,000. The falseness of these calculators is evident, as will likewise be the falseness of those who even now cease not to calculate.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a thing's beginning and also its end it follows that its measure is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us: wherefore if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the beginning of a thing the duration of which is measured by the movement of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, we are able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its end, since the movement of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us. But the measure of the duration of the heavenly movement is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ordinance alone, which is unknown to us. Wherefore however much we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its beginning, we are unable to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The thousand two hundred sixty days mentioned in the Apocalypse (12:6) denote all the time during which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> endures, and not any definite number of years. The reason whereof is because the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is built lasted three years and a half, which time contains almost an equal number of days as the aforesaid number. Again the number of days appointed by <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> does not refer to a number of years to elapse before the end of the world or until the preaching of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, but to the time of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist's</a> preaching and the duration of his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the state of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> in general is foreshadowed by the state of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> correspond to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>: especially since all the figures of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xviii, 52) answers certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who wished to liken the number of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> suffered by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the number of the <a href="../cathen/12143a.htm">plagues of Egypt</a>, in these words: "I do not think that the occurrences in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> were in their signification <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> of these <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, although those who think so have shown nicety and ingenuity in adapting them severally the one to the other, not indeed by a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> spirit, but by the guess-work of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, which sometimes reaches the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and sometimes not." The same remarks would seem applicable to the statements of <a href="../cathen/08406c.htm">Abbot Joachim</a>, who by means of such conjectures about the future foretold some things that were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and in others was deceived.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the resurrection will take place at night-time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will not be at night-time. For the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will not be "till the heavens be broken" (<a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse12">Job 14:12</a>). Now when the heavenly movement ceases, which is signified by its breaking, there will be no time, neither night nor day. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will not be at night-time.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the end of a thing ought to be most perfect. Now the end of time will be then: wherefore it is said (<a href="../bible/rev010.htm#verse6">Apocalypse 10:6</a>) that "time shall be no longer." Therefore time ought to be then in its most perfect disposition and consequently it should be the daytime.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the time should be such as to be adapted to what is done therein: wherefore (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse30">John 13:30</a>) the night is mentioned as being the time when <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> went out from the fellowship of the light. Now, all things that are hidden at the present time will then be made most manifest, because when the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> shall come He "will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts" (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>). Therefore it ought to be during the day.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> is the exemplar of ours. Now <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> was at night, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> for <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> (xxi in Evang.). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a> will also be at night-time.

<p>Further, the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> is compared to the coming of a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> into the house (<a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse39">Luke 12:39-40</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> comes to the house at night-time. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> will also come in the night. Now, when He comes the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will take place, as stated above (Question 76, Article 2). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will be at night-time.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The exact time and hour at which the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will be cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> for certain, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 43). Nevertheless some assert with sufficient probability that it will be towards the twilight, the moon being in the east and the sun in the west; because the sun and moon are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in these positions, and thus their revolutions will be altogether completed by their return to the same point. Wherefore it is said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> arose at such an hour.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> occurs, it will not be time but the end of time; because at the very instant that the heavens will cease to move the dead will rise again. Nevertheless the stars will be in the same position as they occupy now at any fixed hour: and accordingly it is said that the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will be at this or that hour.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The most perfect disposition of time is said to be midday, on account of the light given by the sun. But then the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will need neither sun nor moon, because the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will enlighten it (<a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse5">Apocalypse 22:5</a>). Wherefore in this respect it matters not whether the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> be in the day or in the night.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That time should be adapted to manifestation as regards the things that will happen then, and to secrecy as regards the fixing of the time. Hence either may happen fittingly, namely that the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> be in the day or in the night.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the resurrection will happen suddenly or by degrees?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will not happen suddenly but by degrees. For the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> is foretold (<a href="../bible/eze037.htm#verse7">Ezekiel 37:7-8</a>) where it is written: "The bones came together . . . and I saw and behold the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin was stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them." Therefore the restoration of the bodies will precede in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> their reunion with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and thus the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will not be sudden.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing does not happen suddenly if it require several actions following one another. Now the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> requires several actions following one another, namely the gathering of the ashes, the refashioning of the body, the infusion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will not be sudden.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all sound is measured by <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Now the sound of the trumpet will be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, as stated above (Question 76, Article 2). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will take time and will not happen suddenly.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no local movement can be sudden as stated in De Sensu et Sensato vii. Now the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> requires local movement in the gathering of the ashes. Therefore it will not happen suddenly.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse51">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a>): "We shall all indeed rise again . . . in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will be sudden.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power works suddenly. But the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv): "Thou shalt <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> to be wrought by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and it is evident that this is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will be sudden.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> At the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> something will be done by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and something immediately by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (Question 76, Article 3). Accordingly that which is done by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, will not be instantaneous, if by instant we mean an indivisible point of time, but it will be instantaneous if by instant we mean an imperceptible time. But that which will be done immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power will happen suddenly, namely at the end of the time wherein the work of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will be done, because the higher power brings the lower to perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05737b.htm">Ezechiel</a> spoke, like <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, to a rough people, and therefore, just as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> divided the works of the six days into days, in order that the uncultured people might be able to understand, although all things were made together according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. iv), so <a href="../cathen/05737b.htm">Ezechiel</a> expressed the various things that will happen in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, although they will all happen together in an instant.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although these actions follow one another in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, they are all together in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>: because either they are together in the same instant, or one is in the instant that terminates the other.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> The same would seem to apply to that sound as to the forms of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, namely that the sound will produce its effect in its last instant.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The gathering of the ashes which cannot be without local movement will be done by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Hence it will be in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> though imperceptible on account of the facility of operation which is competent to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.
