<h1>Question 78. That cause of sin which is malice</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2078.htm#article1"> Is it possible for anyone to sin through certain malice, i.e. purposely?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2078.htm#article2"> Does everyone who sins through habit, sin through certain malice?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2078.htm#article3"> Does everyone who sins through certain malice, sin through habit?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2078.htm#article4"> Is it more grievous to sin through certain malice, than through passion?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether anyone sins through certain malice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> purposely, or through certain malice. Because <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is opposed to purpose or certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. Now "every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 1); and it is written (<a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse22">Proverbs 14:22</a>): "They <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> that work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Therefore no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "no one works intending <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Now to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> seems to denote the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> [Alluding to the derivation of "malitia" (<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>) from "malum" (<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>)] in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, because an act is not denominated from that which is unintentional and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. Therefore no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> itself is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it follows that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> goes on <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> indefinitely, which is absurd. Therefore no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job034.htm#verse27">Job 34:27</a>): "[Who] as it were on purpose have revolted from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Him'], and would not understand all His ways." Now to revolt from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> purposely or through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Man like any other being has <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and so if his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> incline away to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, this is due to corruption or disorder in some one of the principles of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for it is thus that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> occurs in the actions of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things. Now the principles of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, both rational (i.e. the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>) and sensitive. Therefore even as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> occurs in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, sometimes through a defect of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as when anyone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and sometimes through a defect in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as when anyone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through passion, so too does it occur through a defect consisting in a disorder of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is out of order when it loves more the lesser <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Again, the consequence of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> a thing less is that one chooses to suffer some hurt in its regard, in order to obtain a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that one loves more: as when a man, even knowingly, suffers the loss of a limb, that he may save his life which he loves more. Accordingly when an inordinate will loves some temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> or pleasure, more than the order of reason or <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, or Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, or some such thing, it follows that it is willing to suffer the loss of some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so that it may obtain possession of some temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is merely the privation of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and so a man wishes knowingly a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> simply, whereby he is deprived of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in order to possess a temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: wherefore he is said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> or on purpose, because he chooses <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> knowingly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> sometimes excludes the simple <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that a particular action is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and then <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: sometimes it excludes the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that a particular action is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> at this particular moment, as when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through passion: and sometimes it excludes the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that a particular <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not to be suffered for the sake of possessing a particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but not the simple <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: it is thus that a man is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> cannot be intended by anyone for its own sake; but it can be intended for the sake of avoiding another <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or obtaining another <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above: and in this case anyone would choose to obtain a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> intended for its own sake, without suffering loss of the other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; even as a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would wish to enjoy a pleasure without offending <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but with the two set before him to choose from, he prefers <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> and thereby incurring <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, to being deprived of the pleasure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> through which anyone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, may be taken to denote <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, in the sense in which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 1) calls an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> by the name of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, just as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and in this way anyone is said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through the inclination of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. It may also denote actual <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, whether by <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> we mean the choice itself of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (and thus anyone is said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, in so far as he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through making a choice of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>), or whether by <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> we mean some previous fault that gives rise to a subsequent fault, as when anyone impugns the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of his brother through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. Nor does this imply that a thing is its own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: for the interior act is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the exterior act, and one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another; not indefinitely, however, since we can trace it back to some previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by any previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as was explained above (75, 4, ad 3).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether everyone that sins through habit, sins through certain malice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not every one who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain malice. Because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, seems to be most grievous. Now it happens sometimes that a man commits a slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as when he utters an idle word. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not always committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Acts proceeding from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are like the acts by which those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> were formed" (Ethic. ii, 1,2). But the acts which precede a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> are not committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that arise from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> are not committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when a man commits a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, he is glad after having done it, according to <a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse14">Proverbs 2:14</a>: "Who are glad when they have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and rejoice in most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> things": and this, because it is pleasant to obtain what we desire, and to do those actions which are connatural to us by reason of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, are sorrowful after committing a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because "bad men," i.e. those who have a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, "are full of remorse" (Ethic. ix, 4). Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that arise from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> are not committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is one that is done through choice of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now we make choice of those things to which we are inclined by <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as stated in Ethic. vi, 2 with regard to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that arises from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is a difference between a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed by one who has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed by <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: for it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to use a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, since it is subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is defined as being "something we use when we will," as stated above (Question 50, Article 1). And thus, even as it may happen that one who has a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> may break forth into a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act, because a bad <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> does not corrupt reason altogether, something of which remains unimpaired, the result being that a sinner does some works which are generically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; so too it may happen sometimes that one who has a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, acts, not from that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but through the uprising of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, or again through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. But whenever he uses the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> he must needs <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>: because to anyone that has a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, whatever is befitting to him in respect of that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, has the aspect of something lovable, since it thereby becomes, in a way, connatural to him, according as custom and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> are a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the very thing which befits a man in respect of a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, is something that excludes a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: the result being that a man chooses a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that he may obtain possession of what befits him in respect of that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: and this is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. Wherefore it is evident that whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not exclude <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, consisting in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Wherefore it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not simply, but in a relative sense: and for that reason the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> thereof is not a simple but a relative <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Acts proceeding from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are of like <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as the acts from which those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> were formed: but they differ from them as perfect from imperfect. Such is the difference between <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is always glad for what he does through <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as long as he uses the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But since he is able not to use the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and to think of something else, by means of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which is not altogether corrupted, it may happen that while not using the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> he is sorry for what he has done through the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. And so it often happens that such a man is sorry for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in itself is displeasing to him, but on account of his reaping some disadvantage from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether one who sins through certain malice, sins through habit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 9) that "an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> action is not done as an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does it," i.e. through choice, "unless it be done through <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>." Now to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through making a choice of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, unless he has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Peri Archon iii) that "a man is not suddenly ruined and lost, but must needs fall away little by little." But the greatest fall seems to be that of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. Therefore a man comes to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, not from the outset, but from inveterate custom, which may engender a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whenever a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, his will must needs be inclined of itself to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> he chooses. But by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that power <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is inclined, not to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> but to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore if he chooses <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, this must be due to something supervening, which is passion or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now when a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through passion, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, but through weakness, as stated (77, 3). Therefore whenever anyone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> stands in the same relation to the choice of something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as the bad <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to the choice of something <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But it happens sometimes that a man, without having the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, chooses that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> according to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore sometimes also a man, without having the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, may choose <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is related differently to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Because from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the power, it is inclined to the rational <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as its proper object; wherefore every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is said to be contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, if a will be inclined, by its choice, to some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, this must be occasioned by something else. Sometimes, in fact, this is occasioned through some defect in the reason, as when anyone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; and sometimes this arises through the impulse of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as when anyone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through passion. Yet neither of these amounts to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>; for then alone does anyone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, when his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of its own accord. This may happen in two ways. First, through his having a corrupt disposition inclining him to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so that, in respect of that disposition, some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is, as it were, suitable and similar to him; and to this thing, by reason of its suitableness, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends, as to something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because everything tends, of its own accord, to that which is suitable to it. Moreover this corrupt disposition is either a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> acquired by custom, or a sickly <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> on the part of the body, as in the case of a man who is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> inclined to certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, by reason of some <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> corruption in himself. Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, of its own accord, may tend to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, through the removal of some obstacle: for instance, if a man be prevented from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, not through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being in itself displeasing to him, but through hope of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, or fear of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, if hope give place to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, or fear to presumption, he will end in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, being freed from the bridle, as it were.

<p>It is evident, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, always presupposes some inordinateness in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which, however, is not always a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: so that it does not follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, if a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To do an action as an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does, may be not only to do <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> things through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, but also to do them with pleasure, and without any notable resistance on the part of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and this occurs only in one who has a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that a man does not fall suddenly into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and that something is presupposed; but this something is not always a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which inclines the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is not always a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, but at times is something else. Moreover, there is no comparison between choosing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and choosing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is never without some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> can be perfect without the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is more grievous to sin through certain malice than through passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not more grievous to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> than through passion. Because <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> either altogether or in part. Now <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is greater in one who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, than in one who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through passion; since he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> suffers from the worst form of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, which according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 8) is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of principle, for he has a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> estimation of the end, which is the principle in matters of action. Therefore there is more excuse for one who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, than for one who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through passion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more a man is impelled to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the less grievous his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as is clear with regard to a man who is thrown headlong into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by a more impetuous passion. Now he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, is impelled by <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, the impulse of which is stronger than that of passion. Therefore to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is less grievous than to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through passion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through choosing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through passion, also chooses <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> less than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is committed on purpose, for this very reason deserves heavier punishment, according to <a href="../bible/job034.htm#verse26">Job 34:26</a>: "He hath struck them as being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, in open sight, who, as it were, on purpose, have revolted from Him." Now punishment is not increased except for a graver fault. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is aggravated through being done on purpose, i.e. through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is more grievous than a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through passion, for three reasons. First, because, as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists chiefly in an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, it follows that, other things being equal, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is all the more grievous, according as the movement of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> belongs more to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now when a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, the movement of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> belongs more to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is then moved to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of its own accord, than when a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed through passion, when the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is impelled to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by something extrinsic, as it were. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is aggravated by the very fact that it is committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and so much the more, as the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is greater; whereas it is diminished by being committed through passion, and so much the more, as the passion is stronger. Secondly, because the passion which incites the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, soon passes away, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> repents of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and soon returns to his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> intentions; whereas the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, through which a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is a permanent <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, so that he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, abides longer in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 8) compares the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, to a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who suffers from a chronic disease, while he compares the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through passion, to one who suffers intermittently. Thirdly, because he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is ill-disposed in respect of the end itself, which is the principle in matters of action; and so the defect is more dangerous than in the case of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through passion, whose purpose tends to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end, although this purpose is interrupted on account of the passion, for the time being. Now the worst of all defects is defect of principle. Therefore it is evident that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is more grievous than one committed through passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> of choice, to which the objection refers, neither excuses nor diminishes a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 76, Article 4). Therefore neither does a greater <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the kind make a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be less grave.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The impulse due to passion, is, as it were, due to a defect which is outside the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: whereas, by a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is inclined from within. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is one thing to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> while choosing, and another to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through choosing. For he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through passion, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> while choosing, but not through choosing, because his choosing is not for him the first principle of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for he is induced through the passion, to choose what he would not choose, were it not for the passion. On the other hand, he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, chooses <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of his own accord, in the way already explained (2,3), so that his choosing, of which he has full control, is the principle of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and for this reason he is said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> "through" choosing.
