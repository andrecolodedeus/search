<h1>Question 78. The form of this sacrament</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4078.htm#article1"> What is the form of this sacrament?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4078.htm#article2"> Is the form for the consecration of the bread appropriate?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4078.htm#article3"> Is the form for the consecration of the blood appropriate?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4078.htm#article4"> The power of each form</a> <li><a href="../summa/4078.htm#article5"> The truth of the expression</a> <li><a href="../summa/4078.htm#article6"> The comparison of the one form with the other</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether this is the form of this sacrament: "This is My body," and "This is the chalice of My blood"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this is not the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: "This is My body," and, "This is the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of My blood." Because those words seem to belong to the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, wherewith Christ <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> His body and blood. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> first blessed the bread which He took, and said afterwards: "Take ye and eat; this is My body" (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse26">Matthew 26:26</a>). Therefore the whole of this seems to belong to the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: and the same reason holds good of the words which go with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the blood.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Eusebius Emissenus (Pseudo-Hieron: Ep. xxix; Pseudo-Isid.: Hom. iv) says: "The invisible Priest changes visible creatures into His own body, saying: 'Take ye and eat; this is My body.'" Therefore, the whole of this seems to belong to the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: and the same hold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the works appertaining to the blood.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> both the minister and his act are expressed, when it is said, "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee." But in the words set forth above there is no mention made either of the minister or of his act. Therefore the form of the sacrament is not a suitable one.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the form of the sacrament suffices for its perfection; hence the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> can be performed sometimes by pronouncing the words of the form only, omitting all the others. Therefore, if the aforesaid words be the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it would seem as if this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> could be performed sometimes by uttering those words alone, while leaving out all the others which are said in the mass; yet this seems to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because, were the other words to be passed over, the said words would be taken as spoken in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> saying them, whereas the bread and wine are not changed into his body and blood. Consequently, the aforesaid words are not the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. iv): "The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is accomplished by the words and expressions of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. Because, by all the other words spoken, praise is rendered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is put up for the people, for kings, and others; but when the time comes for perfecting the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> uses no longer his own words, but the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore, it is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words that perfect this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This sacrament differs from the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in two respects. First of all, in this, that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is accomplished by the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, while the rest are perfected in the use of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Secondly, because in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> consists only in a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, from which the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> derives instrumentally a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power, which through the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who is an animated instrument, can pass on to inanimate instruments. But in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> change of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, which can only be done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; hence the minister in performing this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> has no other act save the pronouncing of the words. And because the form should suit the thing, therefore the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> differs from the forms of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in two respects. First, because the form of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> implies the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as for instance, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, or signing; but the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> implies merely the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which consists in transubstantiation, as when it is said, "This is My body," or, "This is the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of My blood." Secondly, because the forms of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are pronounced in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the minister, whether by way of exercising an act, as when it is said, "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee," or "I confirm thee," etc.; or by way of command, as when it is said in the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a>, "Take the power," etc.; or by way of entreaty, as when in the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> it is said, "By this anointing and our intercession," etc. But the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is pronounced as if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were speaking in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so that it is given to be understood that the minister does nothing in perfecting this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, except to pronounce the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There are many opinions on this matter. Some have said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who had power of excellence in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, performed this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> without using any form of words, and that afterwards He pronounced the words under which others were to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> thereafter. And the words of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> seem to convey the same sense (De Sacr. Alt. Myst. iv), where he says: "In <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> sooth it can be said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> accomplished this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by His Divine power, and subsequently expressed the form under which those who came after were to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>." But in opposition to this view are the words of the Gospel in which it is said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "blessed," and this <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> was effected by certain words. Accordingly those words of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent</a> are to be considered as expressing an opinion, rather than determining the point.

<p>Others, again, have said that the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> was effected by other words not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us. But this statement cannot stand, because the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is now performed by reciting the things which were then accomplished; hence, if the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was not performed then by these words, neither would it be now.

<p>Accordingly, others have maintained that this <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> was effected by the same words as are used now; but that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spoke them twice, at first secretly, in order to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>, and afterwards openly, to instruct others. But even this will not hold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> uses these words, not as spoken in secret, but as openly pronounced. Accordingly, since these words have no power except from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> pronouncing them, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by pronouncing them openly.

<p>And therefore others said that the Evangelists did not always follow the precise order in their narrative as that in which things actually happened, as is seen from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Consens. Evang. ii). Hence it is to be understood that the order of what took place can be expressed thus: "Taking the bread He blessed it, saying: This is My body, and then He broke it, and gave it to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>." But the same sense can be had even without changing the words of the Gospel; because the participle "saying" implies sequence of the words uttered with what goes before. And it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the sequence to be understood only with respect to the last word spoken, as if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had just then pronounced those words, when He gave it to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; but the sequence can be understood with regard to all that had gone before; so that the sense is: "While He was <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, and breaking, and giving it to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, He spoke the words, 'Take ye,'" etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In these words, "Take ye and eat," the use of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is indicated, which is not of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (Question 74, Article 7). And therefore not even these words belong to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Nevertheless, because the use of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> belongs to a certain perfection of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, in the same way as operation is not the first but the second perfection of a thing, consequently, the whole perfection of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is expressed by all those words: and it was in this way that <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> understood that the sacrament was accomplished by those words, as to its first and second perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> the minister exercises an act regarding the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the sacrament: such is not the case in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; hence there is no parallel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Some have contended that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> cannot be accomplished by uttering the aforesaid words, while leaving out the rest, especially the words in the Canon of the Mass. But that this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can be seen both from <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose's</a> words quoted above, as well as from the fact that the Canon of the Mass is not the same in all places or times, but various portions have been introduced by various people.

<p>Accordingly it must be held that if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> were to pronounce only the aforesaid words with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> this sacrament, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> would be valid because the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> these words to be understood as spoken in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even though the words were pronounced without those that precede. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, however, would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> gravely in <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the sacrament thus, as he would not be observing the rite of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nor does the comparison with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> anything; for it is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>: whereas the lack of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can be supplied by the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> partaking thereof, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (cf. 73, 3, ad 1).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether this is the proper form for the consecration of the bread: "This is My body"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this is not the proper form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: "This is My body." For the effect of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought to be expressed in its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But the effect of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread is the change of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and this is better expressed by the word "becomes" than by "is." Therefore, in the form of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> we ought to say: "This becomes My body."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. iv), "Christ's words <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. What word of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>? This word, whereby all things are made. The Lord commanded, and the heavens and earth were made. " Therefore, it would be a more proper form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> if the imperative mood were employed, so as to say: "Be this My body."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is changed is implied in the subject of this phrase, just as the term of the change is implied in the predicate. But just as that into which the change is made is something determinate, for the change is into nothing else but the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so also that which is converted is determinate, since only bread is converted into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore, as a noun is inserted on the part of the predicate, so also should a noun be inserted in the subject, so that it be said: "This bread is My body."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as the term of the change is determinate in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because it is a body, so also is it determinate in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Consequently, in order to determine the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, it ought to be said: "This is the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, nothing ought to be inserted in the form except what is <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> to it. Consequently, the conjunction "for" is improperly added in some books, since it does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> used this form in <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a>, as is evident from <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse26">Matthew 26:26</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This is the proper form for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread. For it was said (1) that this <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> consists in changing the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now the form of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought to denote what is done in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Consequently the form for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread ought to signify the actual conversion of the bread into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And herein are three things to be considered: namely, the actual conversion, the term "whence," and the term "whereunto."

<p>Now the conversion can be considered in two ways: first, in "becoming," secondly, in "being." But the conversion ought not to be signified in this form as in "becoming," but as in "being." First, because such conversion is not successive, as was said above (Question 75, Article 7), but instantaneous; and in such changes the "becoming" is nothing else than the "being." Secondly, because the sacramental forms bear the same relation to the signification of the sacramental effect as artificial forms to the representation of the effect of art. Now an artificial form is the likeness of the ultimate effect, on which the artist's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is fixed;. just as the art-form in the builder's mind is principally the form of the house constructed, and secondarily of the constructing. Accordingly, in this form also the conversion ought to be expressed as in "being," to which the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is referred.

<p>And since the conversion is expressed in this form as in "being," it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the extremes of the conversion to be signified as they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the fact of conversion. But then the term "whereunto" has the proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its own <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; whereas the term "whence" does not remain in its own <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but only as to the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> whereby it comes under the senses, and can be determined in relation to the senses. Hence the term "whence" of the conversion is conveniently expressed by the demonstrative pronoun, relative to the sensible <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> which continue; but the term "whereunto" is expressed by the noun signifying the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing which terminates the conversion, and this is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> entire body, and not merely His flesh; as was said above (76, 1, ad 2). Hence this form is most appropriate: "This is My body."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The ultimate effect of this conversion is not a "becoming" but a "being," as stated above, and consequently prominence should be given to this in the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word operated in the creation of things, and it is the same which operates in this <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, yet each in different fashion: because here it operates effectively and sacramentally, that is, in virtue of its signification. And consequently the last effect of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> must needs be signified in this sentence by a substantive verb of the indicative mood and present time. But in the creation of things it worked merely effectively, and such efficiency is due to the command of His wisdom; and therefore in the creation of things the Lord's word is expressed by a verb in the imperative mood, as in <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse3">Genesis 1:3</a>: "Let there be light, and light was made."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The term "whence" does not retain the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in the "being" of the conversion, as the term "whereunto" does. Therefore there is no parallel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The pronoun "My," which implicitly points to the chief <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the speaker, sufficiently indicates <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, in Whose <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> these words are uttered, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The conjunction "for" is set in this form according to the custom of the Roman Church, who derived it from <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter the Apostle</a>; and this on account of the sequence with the words preceding: and therefore it is not part of the form, just as the words preceding the form are not.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether this is the proper form for the consecration of the wine: "This is the chalice of My blood," etc.?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this is not the proper form for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the wine. "This is the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of My blood, of the New and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Testament, the Mystery of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, which shall be shed for you and for many unto the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." For as the bread is changed by the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, so is the wine changed into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood, as is clear from what was said above (76, 1,2,3). But in the form of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is expressly mentioned, without any addition. Therefore in this form the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is improperly expressed in the oblique case, and the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> in the nominative, when it is said: "This is the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of My blood."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the words spoken in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread are not more efficacious than those spoken in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the wine, since both are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words. But directly the words are spoken--"This is My body," there is perfect <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread. Therefore, directly these other words are uttered--"This is the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of My blood," there is perfect <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the blood; and so the words which follow do not appeal to be of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the form, especially since they refer to the properties of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> seems to be an internal inspiration, as is evident from the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> quoting the words of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> (<a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse31">31:31</a>): "I will perfect unto the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> a <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> . . . I will give My laws into their mind" (<a href="../bible/heb008.htm#verse8">Hebrews 8:8</a>). But a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is an outward visible act. Therefore, in the form of the sacrament the words "of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>" are improperly added.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a thing is said to be new which is near the beginning of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But what is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> has no beginning of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Therefore it is incorrect to say "of the New and Eternal," because it seems to savor of a contradiction.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, occasions of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> ought to be withheld from men, according to <a href="../bible/isa057.htm#verse14">Isaiah 57:14</a>: "Take away the stumbling blocks out of the way of My people." But some have fallen into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in thinking that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and blood are only mystically present in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore it is out of place to add "the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, it was said above (73, 3, ad 3), that as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so is the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Consequently, in this form the word "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>" ought rather to be used than "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, the whole of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, both as to body and blood, is a memorial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse26">1 Corinthians 11:26</a>: "As often as you shall eat this bread and drink the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, you shall show the death of the Lord." Consequently, mention ought to be made of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and its fruit rather in the form of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the blood, than in the form of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the body, especially since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said: "This is My body, which shall be delivered up for you" (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse19">Luke 22:19</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, as was already observed (48, 2; 49, 3), <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> sufficed for all; while as to its efficacy it was profitable for many. Therefore it ought to be said: "Which shall be shed for all," or else "for many," without adding, "for you."

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, the words whereby this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> draw their efficacy from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> institution. But no Evangelist narrates that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spoke all these words. Therefore this is not an appropriate form for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the wine.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Church, instructed by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, uses this form.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is a twofold opinion regarding this form. Some have maintained that the words "This is the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of My blood" alone belong to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of this form, but not those words which follow. Now this seems incorrect, because the words which follow them are determinations of the predicate, that is, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood. Consequently they belong to the integrity of the expression.

<p>And on this account others say more accurately that all the words which follow are of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the form down to the words, "As often as ye shall do this," which belong to the use of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and consequently do not belong to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Hence it is that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> pronounces all these words, under the same rite and manner, namely, holding the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> in his hands. Moreover, in <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse20">Luke 22:20</a>, the words that follow are interposed with the preceding words: "This is the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, the new testament in My blood."

<p>Consequently it must be said that all the aforesaid words belong to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the form; but that by the first words, "This is the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of My blood," the change of the wine into blood is denoted, as explained above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) in the form for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread; but by the words which come after is shown the power of the blood shed in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, which power works in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and is ordained for three purposes. First and principally for securing our <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> heritage, according to <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse19">Hebrews 10:19</a>: "Having confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ"; and in order to denote this, we say, "of the New and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Testament." Secondly, for justifying by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse25">Romans 3:25-26</a>: "Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed to be a propitiation, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His blood . . . that He Himself may be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and the justifier of him who is of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>": and on this account we add, "The Mystery of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>." Thirdly, for removing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are the <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to both of these things, according to <a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse14">Hebrews 9:14</a>: "The blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> . . . shall cleanse our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> from dead works," that is, from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and on this account, we say, "which shall be shed for you and for many unto the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The expression "This is the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of My blood" is a figure of speech, which can be understood in two ways. First, as a figure of metonymy; because the container is put for the contained, so that the meaning is: "This is My blood contained in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>"; of which mention is now made, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, inasmuch as it is the drink of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, which is not implied under the notion of blood; consequently this had to be denoted by the vessel adapted for such usage. Secondly, it can be taken by way of metaphor, so that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>

<p>is understood by the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> by way of comparison, because, like a cup, it inebriates, according to <a href="../bible/lam003.htm#verse15">Lamentations 3:15</a>: "He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath inebriated me with wormwood": hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself spoke of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> as a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, when He said (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew 26:39</a>): "Let this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> pass away from Me": so that the meaning is: "This is the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of My <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>." This is denoted by the blood being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> apart from the body; because it was by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> that the blood was separated from the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As was said above (ad 1; 76, 2, ad 1), the blood <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> apart expressly represents <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, and therefore mention is made of the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the blood rather than in that of the body, since the body is the subject of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. This is also pointed out in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> saying, "which shall be delivered up for you," as if to say, "which shall undergo the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> for you."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A testament is the disposal of a heritage. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> disposed of a heavenly heritage to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to be bestowed through the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; because, according to <a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse16">Hebrews 9:16</a>: "Where there is a testament the death of the testator must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> come in." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood was exhibited to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in two ways. First of all in figure, and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; consequently the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> concludes (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse16">Hebrews 9:16</a>): "Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood," which is evident from this, that as related in <a href="../bible/exo024.htm#verse7">Exodus 24:7-8</a>, "when every" commandment of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> "had been read" by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, "he sprinkled all the people" saying: "This is the blood of the testament which the Lord hath enjoined unto you."

<p>Secondly, it was shown in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. This is what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> premises when he says (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse15">Romans 9:15</a>): "Therefore He is the Mediator of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, that by means of His death . . . they that are called may receive the promise of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> inheritance." Consequently, we say here, "The blood of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>," because it is shown now not in figure but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and therefore we add, "which shall be shed for you." But the internal inspiration has its origin in the power of this blood, according as we are justified by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This Testament is a "new one" by reason of its showing forth: yet it is called "<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>" both on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> pre-ordination, as well as on account of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> heritage which is prepared by this testament. Moreover, Christ's Person is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, in Whose blood this testament is appointed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The word "<a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>" is inserted, not in order to exclude reality, but to show that the reality is hidden, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in a hidden manner, and His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was dimly foreshadowed in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> It is called the "Sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>," as being an object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: because by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone do we hold the presence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Moreover <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> justifies by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is called the "Sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>" because it is a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This is called the "Sacrament of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>," as being figurative and effective thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> As stated above (ad 2), the blood <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> apart represents <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood more expressively; and therefore mention is made of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and its fruits, in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the blood rather than in that of the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> The blood of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> has its efficacy not merely in the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, to whom the blood of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> was exhibited, but also in the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; nor only in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> this sacrament, and in those others who partake of it; but likewise in those for whom it is offered. And therefore He says expressly, "for you," the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, "and for many," namely the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; or, "for you" who eat of it, and "for many," for whom it is offered.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> The Evangelists did not intend to hand down the forms of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which in the primitive Church had to be kept concealed, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> observes at the close of his book on the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>; their object was to write the story of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Nevertheless nearly all these words can be culled from various passages of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. Because the words, "This is the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>," are found in <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse20">Luke 22:20</a>, and <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse25">1 Corinthians 11:25</a>, while Matthew says in <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse28">26:28</a>: "This is My blood of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which shall be shed for many unto the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." The words added, namely, "<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>" and "<a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," were handed down to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who received them from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse23">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>: "I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether in the aforesaid words of the forms there be any created power which causes the consecration?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that in the aforesaid words of the forms there is no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the consecration. Because <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv): "The change of the bread into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> solely by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." But the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is uncreated. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power of those words.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> works are wrought not by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power, but solely by Divine power, as was stated in I, 110, 4. But the change of the bread and wine into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and blood is a work not less <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> than the creation of things, or than the formation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body in the womb of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>: which things could not be done by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power. Therefore, neither is this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power of the aforesaid words.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the aforesaid words are not simple, but composed of many; nor are they uttered simultaneously, but successively. But, as stated above (Question 75, Article 7), this change is wrought instantaneously. hence it must be done by a simple power. Therefore it is not effected by the power of those words.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. iv): "If there be such might in the word of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> that things non-existent came into being, how much more efficacious is it to make things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> to continue, and to be changed into something else? And so, what was bread before <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is now the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> word changes a creature into something different."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have maintained that neither in the above words is there any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power for <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> the transubstantiation, nor in the other forms of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, or even in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> themselves, for producing the sacramental effects. This, as was shown above (62, 1), is both contrary to the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and detracts from the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Hence, since this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is of greater worth than the others, as stated above (Question 65, Article 3), the result is that there is in the words of the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the change to be wrought in it: instrumental, however, as in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as stated above (62, 3,4). For since these words are uttered in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it is from His command that they receive their instrumental power from Him, just as His other <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and sayings derive their salutary power instrumentally, as was observed above (48, 6; 56, 1, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When the bread is said to be changed into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body solely by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the instrumental power which lies in the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not excluded: just as when we say that the smith alone makes a knife we do not deny the power of the hammer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> No creature can work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> as the chief agent. yet it can do so instrumentally, just as the touch of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> hand healed the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>. And in this fashion <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words change the bread into His body. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception, whereby His body was fashioned, it was impossible for anything derived from His body to have the instrumental power of forming that very body. Likewise in creation there was no term wherein the instrumental action of a creature could be received. Consequently there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The aforesaid words, which work the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, operate sacramentally. Consequently, the converting power latent under the forms of these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> follows the meaning, which is terminated in the uttering of the last word. And therefore the aforesaid words have this power in the last instant of their being uttered, taken in conjunction with those uttered before. And this power is simple by reason of the thing signified, although there be composition in the words uttered outwardly.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the aforesaid expressions are true?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the aforesaid expressions are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Because when we say: "This is My body," the word "this" designates a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. But according to what was said above (1,4, ad 3; 75, 2,7), when the pronoun "this" is spoken, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread is still there, because the transubstantiation takes place in the last instant of pronouncing the words. But it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> to say: "Bread is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body." Consequently this expression, "This is My body," is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the pronoun "this" appeals to the senses. But the sensible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> are neither <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body nor even its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. Therefore this expression, "This is My body," cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as was observed above (4, ad 3), these words, by their signification, effect the change of the bread into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But an effective <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is understood as preceding its effect. Therefore the meaning of these words is understood as preceding the change of the bread into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But previous to the change this expression, "This is My body," is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore the expression is to be judged as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> simply; and the same reason holds good of the other phrase: "This is the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of My blood," etc.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> These words are pronounced in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who says of Himself (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John 14:6</a>): "I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There have been many opinions on this point. Some have said that in this expression, "This is My body," the word "this" implies demonstration as conceived, and not as exercised, because the whole phrase is taken materially, since it is uttered by a way of narration: for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> relates that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> said: "This is My body."

<p>But such a view cannot hold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because then these words would not be applied to the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> present, and consequently the sacrament would not be valid: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.): "The word is added to the element, and this becomes a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>." Moreover this solution ignores entirely the difficulty which this question presents: for there is still the objection in regard to the first uttering of these words by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; since it is evident that then they were employed, not materially, but significatively. And therefore it must be said that even when spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> they are taken significatively, and not merely materially. Nor does it matter that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> pronounces them by way of recital, as though they were spoken by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because owing to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, just as through contact with His flesh the regenerative power entered not only into the waters which came into contact with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but into all waters throughout the whole world and during all future ages, so likewise from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> uttering these words they derived their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> power, by whatever <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> they be uttered, as if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> present were saying them.

<p>And therefore others have said that in this phrase the word "this" appeals, not to the senses, but to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; so that the meaning is, "This is My body"--i.e. "The thing signified by 'this' is My body." But neither can this stand, because, since in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> the effect is that which is signified, from such a form it would not result that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but merely as in a sign, which is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, as stated above (Question 85, Article 1).

<p>Consequently, others have said that the word "this" appeals to the senses; not at the precise instant of its being uttered, but merely at the last instant thereof; as when a man says, "Now I am silent," this adverb "now" points to the instant immediately following the speech: because the sense is: "Directly these words are spoken I am silent." But neither can this hold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because in that case the meaning of the sentence would be: "My body is My body," which the above phrase does not effect, because this was so even before the utterance of the words: hence neither does the aforesaid sentence mean this.

<p>Consequently, then, it remains to be said, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), that this sentence possesses the power of effecting the conversion of the bread into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And therefore it is compared to other sentences, which have power only of signifying and not of producing, as the concept of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is productive of the thing, is compared to the concept of our speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which is drawn from things. because "words are signs of concepts," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Peri Herm. i). And therefore as the concept of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not presuppose the thing understood, but makes it, so the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this expression does not presuppose the thing signified, but makes it; for such is the relation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word to the things made by the Word. Now this change takes place not successively, but in an instant, as stated above (Question 77, Article 7). Consequently one must understand the aforesaid expression with reference to the last instant of the words being spoken, yet not so that the subject may be understood to have stood for that which is the term of the conversion; viz. that the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the body of Christ; nor again that the subject be understood to stand for that which it was before the conversion, namely, the bread. but for that which is commonly related to both, i.e. that which is contained in general under those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For these words do not make the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor do they make the bread to be the body of Christ; but what was contained under those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and was formerly bread, they make to be the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And therefore expressly <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> did not say: "This bread is My body," which would be the meaning of the second opinion; nor "This My body is My body," which would be the meaning of the third opinion: but in general: "This is My body," assigning no noun on the part of the subject, but only a pronoun, which signifies <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in common, without <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, that is, without a determinate form.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The term "this" points to a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, yet without determining its proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The pronoun "this" does not indicate the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> underlying the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, which at first was bread, and is afterwards the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which body, although not informed by those <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, is yet contained under them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The meaning of this expression is, in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, understood before the thing signified, just as a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to the effect; but not in order of time, because this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> has its effect with it at the same time, and this suffices for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the expression.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the form of the consecration of the bread accomplishes its effect before the form of the consecration of the wine be completed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the form of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread does not accomplish its effect until the form for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the wine be completed. For, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body begins to be in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread, so does His blood come to be there by the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the wine. If, then, the words for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the bread were to produce their effect before the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the wine, it would follow that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body would be present in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> without the blood, which is improper.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one sacrament has one completion: hence although there be three immersions in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, yet the first immersion does not produce its effect until the third be completed. But all this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is one, as stated above (Question 73, Article 2). Therefore the words whereby the bread is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> do not bring about their effect without the sacramental words whereby the wine is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there are several words in the form for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the bread, the first of which do not secure their effect until the last be uttered, as stated above (4, ad 3). Therefore, for the same reason, neither do the words for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body produce their effect, until the words for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> Christ's blood are spoken.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Directly the words are uttered for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the bread, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> host is shown to the people to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>, which would not be done if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body were not there, for that would be an act of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> words of the bread produce their effect before. the words are spoken for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the wine.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some of the earlier <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> said that these two forms, namely, for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the bread and the wine, await each other's action, so that the first does not produce its effect until the second be uttered.

<p>But this cannot stand, because, as stated above (5, ad 3), for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this phrase, "This is My body," wherein the verb is in the present tense, it is required for the thing signified to be present simultaneously in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> with the signification of the expression used; otherwise, if the thing signified had to be awaited for afterwards, a verb of the future tense would be employed, and not one of the present tense, so that we should not say, "This is My body," but "This will be My body." But the signification of this speech is complete directly those words are spoken. And therefore the thing signified must be present instantaneously, and such is the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; otherwise it would not be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> speech. Moreover, this opinion is against the rite of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which forthwith adores the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> after the words are uttered.

<p>Hence it must be said that the first form does not await the second in its action, but has its effect on the instant.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is on this account that they who maintained the above opinion seem to have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a>. Hence it must be understood that directly the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread is complete, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is indeed present by the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and the blood by real concomitance; but afterwards by the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the wine, conversely, the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is there by the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and the body by real concomitance, so that the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is under either <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (Question 76, Article 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This sacrament is one in perfection, as stated above (73, 2), namely, inasmuch as it is made up of two things, that is, of food and drink, each of which of itself has its own perfection; but the three immersions of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> are ordained to one simple effect, and therefore there is no resemblance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The various words in the form for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the bread constitute the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of one speech, but the words of the different forms do not, and consequently there is no parallel.
