<h1>Question 78. The specific powers of the soul</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1078.htm#article1"> The powers of the soul considered generally</a> <li><a href="../summa/1078.htm#article2"> The various species of the vegetative part</a> <li><a href="../summa/1078.htm#article3"> The exterior senses</a> <li><a href="../summa/1078.htm#article4"> The interior senses</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there are to be distinguished five genera of powers in the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are not to be distinguished five genera of powers in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--namely, vegetative, sensitive, <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>, locomotive, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. For the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are called its parts. But only three parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are commonly assigned--namely, the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore there are only three genera of powers in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and not five.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are the principles of its vital operations. Now, in four ways is a thing said to live. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 2): "In several ways a thing is said to live, and even if only one of these is present, the thing is said to live; as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and sense, local movement and rest, and lastly, movement of decrease and increase due to nourishment." Therefore there are only four genera of powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> is excluded.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ought not to be assigned as regards what is common to all the powers. Now desire is common to each power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For sight desires an appropriate visible object; whence we read (<a href="../bible/sir040.htm#verse22">Sirach 40:22</a>): "The eye desireth favor and beauty, but more than these green sown fields." In the same way every other power desires its appropriate object. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power should not be made a special genus of the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the moving principle in animals is sense, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 10). Therefore the motive power should not be added to the above as a special genus of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 3), "The powers are the vegetative, the sensitive, the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>, the locomotion, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are five genera of powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as above numbered. Of these, three are called <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and four are called modes of living. The reason of this diversity lies in the various <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> being distinguished accordingly as the operation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> transcends the operation of the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in various ways; for the whole corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is subject to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and is related to it as its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and instrument. There <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, therefore, an operation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which so far exceeds the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that it is not even performed by any corporeal organ; and such is the operation of the "rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Below this, there is another operation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is indeed performed through a corporeal organ, but not through a corporeal <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, and this is the operation of the "sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"; for though hot and cold, wet and dry, and other such corporeal <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> are required for the work of the senses, yet they are not required in such a way that the operation of the senses takes place by virtue of such <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>; but only for the proper disposition of the organ. The lowest of the operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is that which is performed by a corporeal organ, and by virtue of a corporeal <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. Yet this transcends the operation of the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; because the movements of bodies are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an extrinsic principle, while these operations are from an intrinsic principle; for this is common to all the operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; since every animate thing, in some way, moves itself. Such is the operation of the "vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"; for digestion, and what follows, is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> instrumentally by the action of heat, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 4).

<p>Now the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are distinguished generically by their objects. For the higher a power is, the more universal is the object to which it extends, as we have said above (77, 3, ad 4). But the object of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> operation may be considered in a triple order. For in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there is a power the object of which is only the body that is united to that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; the powers of this genus are called "vegetative" for the vegetative power acts only on the body to which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united. There is another genus in the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which genus regards a more universal object--namely, every sensible body, not only the body to which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united. And there is yet another genus in the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which genus regards a still more universal object--namely, not only the sensible body, but all being in universal. Wherefore it is evident that the latter two genera of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers have an operation in regard not merely to that which is united to them, but also to something extrinsic. Now, since whatever operates must in some way be united to the object about which it operates, it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that this something extrinsic, which is the object of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> operation, must be related to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in a twofold manner.

<p>First, inasmuch as this something extrinsic has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to be united to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and to be by its likeness in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In this way there are two kinds of powers --namely, the "sensitive" in regard to the less common object--the sensible body; and the "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>," in regard to the most common object--universal being.

<p>Secondly, forasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself has an inclination and tendency to the something extrinsic. And in this way there are again two kinds of powers in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: one--the "<a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>"--in respect of which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is referred to something extrinsic as to an end, which is first in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>; the other--the "locomotive" power--in respect of which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is referred to something extrinsic as to the term of its operation and movement; for every animal is moved for the purpose of realizing its desires and intentions.

<p>The modes of living are distinguished according to the degrees of living things. There are some living things in which there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> only vegetative power, as the plants. There are others in which with the vegetative there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> also the sensitive, but not the locomotive power; such as immovable animals, as shellfish. There are others which besides this have locomotive powers, as perfect animals, which require many things for their life, and consequently movement to seek necessaries of life from a distance. And there are some living things which with these have <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power--namely, men. But the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power does not constitute a degree of living things; because wherever there is sense there is also <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> (De Anima ii, 3).

<p>Thus the first two objectives are hereby solved.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>" is that inclination which each thing has, of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for something; wherefore by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> each power desires something suitable to itself. But the "animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>" results from the form apprehended; this sort of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> requires a special power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--mere apprehension does not suffice. For a thing is desired as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereas in the apprehensive power it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> not according to its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but according to its likeness. Whence it is clear that sight desires <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> a visible object for the purpose of its act only--namely, for the purpose of seeing; but the animal by the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power desires the thing seen, not merely for the purpose of seeing it, but also for other purposes. But if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did not require things perceived by the senses, except on account of the actions of the senses, that is, for the purpose of sensing them; there would be no need for a special genus of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers, since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of the powers would suffice.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although sense and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> are principles of movement in perfect animals, yet sense and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as such, are not sufficient to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> movement, unless another power be added to them; for immovable animals have sense and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and yet they have not the power of motion. Now this motive power is not only in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> and sense as commanding the movement, but also in the parts of the body, to make them obey the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which moves them. Of this we have a sign in the fact that when the members are deprived of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition, they do not move in obedience to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the parts of the vegetative soul are fittingly described as the nutritive, augmentative, and generative?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the parts of the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are not fittingly described--namely, the nutritive, augmentative, and generative. For these are called "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>" forces. But the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are above the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forces. Therefore we should not class the above forces as powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we should not assign a particular power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to that which is common to living and non-living things. But generation is common to all things that can be generated and corrupted, whether living or not living. Therefore the generative force should not be classed as a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more powerful than the body. But the body by the same force gives <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; much more, therefore, does the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the augmentative power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not distinct from the generative power.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, everything is preserved in being by that whereby it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. But the generative power is that whereby a living thing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. Therefore by the same power the living thing is preserved. Now the nutritive force is directed to the preservation of the living thing (De Anima ii, 4), being "a power which is capable of preserving whatever receives it." Therefore we should not distinguish the nutritive power from the generative.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 2,4) that the operations of this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are "generation, the use of food," and (cf. De Anima iii, 9) "growth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The vegetative part has three powers. For the vegetative part, as we have said (1), has for its object the body itself, living by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for which body a triple operation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is required. One is whereby it acquires <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and to this is directed the "generative" power. Another is whereby the living body acquires its due <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; to this is directed the "augmentative" power. Another is whereby the body of a living thing is preserved in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and in its due <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; to this is directed the "nutritive" power.

<p>We must, however, observe a difference among these powers. The nutritive and the augmentative have their effect where they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, since the body itself united to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> grows and is preserved by the augmentative and nutritive powers which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in one and the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the generative power has its effect, not in one and the same body but in another; for a thing cannot generate itself. Therefore the generative power, in a way, approaches to the dignity of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which has an operation extending to extrinsic things, although in a more excellent and more universal manner; for that which is highest in an inferior <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> approaches to that which is lowest in the higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as is made clear by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. vii). Therefore, of these three powers, the generative has the greater finality, nobility, and perfection, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 4), for it belongs to a thing which is already perfect to "produce another like unto itself." And the generative power is served by the augmentative and nutritive powers; and the augmentative power by the nutritive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Such forces are called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, both because they produce an effect like that of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which also gives <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> and preservation (although the above forces accomplish these things in a more perfect way); and because those forces perform their actions instrumentally, through the active and passive <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, which are the principles of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> actions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Generation of inanimate things is entirely from an extrinsic source; whereas the generation of living things is in a higher way, through something in the living thing itself, which is the semen containing the principle productive of the body. Therefore there must be in the living thing a power that prepares this semen; and this is the generative power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since the generation of living things is from a semen, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that in the beginning an animal of small size be generated. For this reason it must have a power in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whereby it is brought to its appropriate size. But the inanimate body is generated from determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by an extrinsic agent; therefore it receives at once its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and its <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As we have said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the operation of the vegetative principle is performed by means of heat, the property of which is to consume humidity. Therefore, in order to restore the humidity thus lost, the nutritive power is required, whereby the food is changed into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the body. This is also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the action of the augmentative and generative powers.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the five exterior senses are properly distinguished?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem inaccurate to distinguish five exterior senses. But there are many kinds of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. Therefore, as powers are distinguished by their objects, it seems that the senses are multiplied according to the number of the kinds of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, magnitude and shape, and other things which are called "common sensibles," are "not sensibles by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>," but are contradistinguished from them by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, 6). Now the diversity of objects, as such, diversifies the powers. Since, therefore, magnitude and shape are further from color than sound is, it seems that there is much more need for another sensitive power than can grasp magnitude or shape than for that which grasps color or sound.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one sense regards one contrariety; as sight regards white and black. But the sense of touch grasps several contraries; such as hot or cold, damp or dry, and suchlike. Therefore it is not a single sense but several. Therefore there are more than five senses.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is not divided against its genus. But taste is a kind of touch. Therefore it should not be classed as a distinct sense of touch.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 1): "There is no other besides the five senses."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The reason of the distinction and number of the senses has been assigned by some to the organs in which one or other of the elements preponderate, as water, air, or the like. By others it has been assigned to the medium, which is either in conjunction or extrinsic and is either water or air, or such like. Others have ascribed it to the various natures of the sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, according as such <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> belongs to a simple body or results from complexity. But none of these explanations is apt. For the powers are not for the organs, but the organs for the powers; wherefore there are not various powers for the reason that there are various organs; on the contrary, for this has <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> provided a variety of organs, that they might be adapted to various powers. In the same way <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> provided various mediums for the various senses, according to the convenience of the acts of the powers. And to be cognizant of the natures of sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> does not pertain to the senses, but to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>The reason of the number and distinction of the exterior senses must therefore be ascribed to that which belongs to the senses properly and "per se." Now, sense is a passive power, and is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> immuted by the exterior sensible. Wherefore the exterior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of such immutation is what is "per se" perceived by the sense, and according to the diversity of that exterior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> are the sensitive powers diversified.

<p>Now, immutation is of two kinds, one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, the other <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Natural immutation takes place by the form of the immuter being received according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, into the thing immuted, as heat is received into the thing heated. Whereas <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> immutation takes place by the form of the immuter being received, according to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, into the thing immuted, as the form of color is received into the pupil which does not thereby become colored. Now, for the operation of the senses, a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> immutation is required, whereby an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the sensible form is effected in the sensile organ. Otherwise, if a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> immutation alone sufficed for the sense's action, all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies would feel when they undergo alteration.

<p>But in some senses we find <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> immutation only, as in "sight" while in others we find not only <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> but also a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> immutation; either on the part of the object only, or likewise on the part of the organ. On the part of the object we find <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> immutation, as to place, in sound which is the object of "hearing"; for sound is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by percussion and commotion of air: and we find <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> immutation by alteration, in odor which is the object of "smelling"; for in order to exhale an odor, a body must be in a measure affected by heat. On the part of an organ, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> immutation takes place in "touch" and "taste"; for the hand that touches something hot becomes hot, while the tongue is moistened by the humidity of the flavored morsel. But the organs of smelling and hearing are not affected in their respective operations by any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> immutation unless indirectly.

<p>Now, the sight, which is without <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> immutation either in its organ or in its object, is the most <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, the most perfect, and the most universal of all the senses. After this comes the hearing and then the smell, which require a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> immutation on the part of the object; while local motion is more perfect than, and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to, the motion of alteration, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. viii, 7). Touch and taste are the most material of all: of the distinction of which we shall speak later on (ad 3,4). Hence it is that the three other senses are not exercised through a medium united to them, to obviate any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> immutation in their organ; as happens as regards these two senses.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not every <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> has in itself a power of immutation but only <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which are the principles of alteration: therefore only suchlike <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> are the objects of the senses; because "the senses are affected by the same things whereby inanimate bodies are affected," as stated in Phys. vii, 2.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Size, shape, and the like, which are called "common sensibles," are midway between "<a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> sensibles" and "proper sensibles," which are the objects of the senses. For the proper sensibles first, and of their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, affect the senses; since they are <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> alteration. But the common sensibles are all reducible to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. As to size and number, it is clear that they are <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Shape is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> about <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Shape is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> about <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, since the notion of shape consists of fixing the bounds of magnitude. Movement and rest are sensed according as the subject is affected in one or more ways in the magnitude of the subject or of its local distance, as in the movement of growth or of locomotion, or again, according as it is affected in some sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, as in the movement of alteration; and thus to sense movement and rest is, in a way, to sense one thing and many. Now <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is the proximate subject of the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> alteration, as surface is of color. Therefore the common sensibles do not move the senses first and of their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by reason of the sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>; as the surface by reason of color. Yet they are not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> sensibles, for they produce a certain variety in the immutation of the senses. For sense is immuted differently by a large and by a small surface: since whiteness itself is said to be great or small, and therefore it is divided according to its proper subject.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> seems to say (De Anima ii, 11), the sense of touch is generically one, but is divided into several specific senses, and for this reason it extends to various contrarieties; which senses, however, are not separate from one another in their organ, but are spread throughout the whole body, so that their distinction is not evident. But taste, which perceives the sweet and the bitter, accompanies touch in the tongue, but not in the whole body; so it is easily distinguished from touch. We might also say that all those contrarieties agree, each in some proximate genus, and all in a common genus, which is the common and formal object of touch. Such common genus is, however, unnamed, just as the proximate genus of hot and cold is unnamed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The sense of taste, according to a saying of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, 9), is a kind of touch <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the tongue only. It is not distinct from touch in general, but only from the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of touch distributed in the body. But if touch is one sense only, on account of the common formality of its object: we must say that taste is distinguished from touch by reason of a different formality of immutation. For touch involves a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and not only a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, immutation in its organ, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> which is its proper object. But the organ of taste is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> immuted by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> immutation by reason of the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> which is its proper object, so that the tongue itself becomes sweet and bitter: but by reason of a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> which is a preamble to, and on which is based, the flavor, which <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is moisture, the object of touch.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the interior senses are suitably distinguished?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the interior senses are not suitably distinguished. For the common is not divided against the proper. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a> should not be numbered among the interior sensitive powers, in addition to the proper exterior senses.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is no need to assign an interior power of apprehension when the proper and exterior sense suffices. But the proper and exterior senses suffice for us to judge of sensible things; for each sense judges of its proper object. In like manner they seem to suffice for the perception of their own actions; for since the action of the sense is, in a way, between the power and its object, it seems that sight must be much more able to perceive its own vision, as being nearer to it, than the color; and in like manner with the other senses. Therefore for this there is no need to assign an interior power, called the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Memor. et Remin. i), the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the "first sensitive." But passion is not divided against its subject. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> should not be assigned as powers distinct from the senses.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> depends on the senses less than any power of the sensitive part. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing but what it receives from the senses; whence we read (Poster. i, 8), that "those who lack one sense lack one kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Therefore much less should we assign to the sensitive part a power, which they call the "estimative" power, for the perception of intentions which the sense does not perceive.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the action of the cogitative power, which consists in comparing, adding and dividing, and the action of the reminiscence, which consists in the use of a kind of syllogism for the sake of inquiry, is not less distant from the actions of the estimative and memorative powers, than the action of the estimative is from the action of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Therefore either we must add the cognitive and reminiscitive to the estimative and memorative powers, or the estimative and memorative powers should not be made distinct from the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii, 6,7,24) describes three kinds of vision; namely, corporeal, which is the action of the sense; <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, which is an action of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> or phantasy; and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, which is an action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore there is no interior power between the sense and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, besides the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> (De Anima iv, 1) assigns five interior sensitive powers; namely, "<a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a>, phantasy, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and the estimative and memorative powers."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not fail in <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things, there must needs be as many actions of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as may suffice for the life of a perfect animal. If any of these actions cannot be reduced to the same one principle, they must be assigned to diverse powers; since a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is nothing else than the proximate principle of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> operation.

<p>Now we must observe that for the life of a perfect animal, the animal should apprehend a thing not only at the actual time of sensation, but also when it is absent. Otherwise, since animal motion and action follow apprehension, an animal would not be moved to seek something absent: the contrary of which we may observe specially in perfect animals, which are moved by progression, for they are moved towards something apprehended and absent. Therefore an animal through the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must not only receive the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sensible things, when it is actually affected by them, but it must also retain and preserve them. Now to receive and retain are, in corporeal things, reduced to diverse principles; for moist things are apt to receive, but retain with difficulty, while it is the reverse with dry things. Wherefore, since the sensitive power is the act of a corporeal organ, it follows that the power which receives the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sensible things must be distinct from the power which preserves them.

<p>Again we must observe that if an animal were moved by pleasing and disagreeable things only as affecting the sense, there would be no need to suppose that an animal has a power besides the apprehension of those forms which the senses perceive, and in which the animal takes pleasure, or from which it shrinks with horror. But the animal needs to seek or to avoid certain things, not only because they are pleasing or otherwise to the senses, but also on account of other advantages and uses, or disadvantages: just as the sheep runs away when it sees a wolf, not on account of its color or shape, but as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> enemy: and again a bird gathers together straws, not because they are pleasant to the sense, but because they are useful for building its nest. Animals, therefore, need to perceive such intentions, which the exterior sense does not perceive. And some distinct principle is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for this; since the perception of sensible forms comes by an immutation <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the sensible, which is not the case with the perception of those intentions.

<p>Thus, therefore, for the reception of sensible forms, the "proper sense" and the "<a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a>" are appointed, and of their distinction we shall speak farther on (ad 1,2). But for the retention and preservation of these forms, the "phantasy" or "<a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>" is appointed; which are the same, for phantasy or <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is as it were a storehouse of forms received through the senses. Furthermore, for the apprehension of intentions which are not received through the senses, the "estimative" power is appointed: and for the preservation thereof, the "memorative" power, which is a storehouse of such-like intentions. A sign of which we have in the fact that the principle of <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> in animals is found in some such <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, for instance, that something is harmful or otherwise. And the very formality of the past, which <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> observes, is to be reckoned among these intentions.

<p>Now, we must observe that as to sensible forms there is no difference between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and other animals; for they are similarly immuted by the extrinsic sensible. But there is a difference as to the above intentions: for other animals perceive these intentions only by some <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, while <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> perceives them by means of coalition of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Therefore the power by which in other animals is called the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> estimative, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is called the "cogitative," which by some sort of collation discovers these intentions. Wherefore it is also called the "particular reason," to which medical men assign a certain particular organ, namely, the middle part of the head: for it compares <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> intentions, just as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> reason compares universal intentions. As to the memorative power, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has not only <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, as other animals have in the sudden recollection of the past; but also "reminiscence" by syllogistically, as it were, seeking for a recollection of the past by the application of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> intentions. <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>, however, assigns between the estimative and the imaginative, a fifth power, which combines and divides <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> forms: as when from the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> form of gold, and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> form of a mountain, we compose the one form of a golden mountain, which we have never seen. But this operation is not to be found in animals other than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in whom the imaginative power suffices thereto. To <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also does <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a> attribute this action in his book De sensu et sensibilibus (viii). So there is no need to assign more than four interior powers of the sensitive part--namely, the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and the estimative and memorative powers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The interior sense is called "common" not by predication, as if it were a genus; but as the common root and principle of the exterior senses.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The proper sense judges of the proper sensible by discerning it from other things which come under the same sense; for instance, by discerning white from black or green. But neither sight nor taste can discern white from sweet: because what discerns between two things must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both. Wherefore the discerning judgment must be assigned to the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a>; to which, as to a common term, all apprehensions of the senses must be referred: and by which, again, all the intentions of the senses are perceived; as when someone sees that he sees. For this cannot be done by the proper sense, which only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the form of the sensible by which it is immuted, in which immutation the action of sight is completed, and from immutation follows another in the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a> which perceives the act of vision.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As one power arises from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by means of another, as we have seen above (Question 77, Article 7), so also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the subject of one power through another. In this way the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> are called <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the "first sensitive."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has its origin in the senses: yet, in the thing apprehended through the senses, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> many things which the senses cannot perceive. In like manner does the estimative power, though in a less perfect manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The cogitative and memorative powers in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> owe their excellence not to that which is proper to the sensitive part; but to a certain affinity and proximity to the universal reason, which, so to speak, overflows into them. Therefore they are not distinct powers, but the same, yet more perfect than in other animals.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> calls that vision <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> which is effected by the images of bodies in the absence of bodies. Whence it is clear that it is common to all interior apprehensions.
