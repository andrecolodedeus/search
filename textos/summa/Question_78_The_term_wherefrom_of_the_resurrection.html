<h1>Question 78. The term "wherefrom" of the resurrection</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5078.htm#article1"> Is death the term "wherefrom" of the resurrection in every case?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5078.htm#article2"> Are ashes, or dust?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5078.htm#article3"> Does this dust have a natural inclination towards the soul?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether death will be the term "wherefrom" of the resurrection in all cases?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that death will not be the term "wherefrom" of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> in all cases. Because some shall not die but shall be clothed with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>: for it is said in the creed that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> "will come to judge the living and the dead." Now this cannot refer to the time of judgment, because then all will be alive; therefore this distinction must refer to the previous time, and consequently all will not die before the judgment.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and common desire cannot be empty and vain, but is fulfilled in some cases. Now according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>) it is a common desire that "we would not be unclothed but clothed upon." Therefore there will be some who will never be stripped of the body by death, but will be arrayed in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion cxv) that the four last petitions of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a> refer to the present life: and one of them is: "Forgive us our debts [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'trespasses']." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that all debts may be forgiven her in this life. Now the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> cannot be void and not granted: "If you ask the Father anything in My name, He will give it you" (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse23">John 16:23</a>). Therefore at some time of this life the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> will receive the remission of all debts: and one of the debts to which we are bound by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> is that we be born in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Therefore at some time <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will grant to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that men be born without <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. But death is the punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Therefore at the end of the world there will be some men who will not die: and so the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should always choose the shortest way. Now the shortest way is for the men who shall be found living to be transferred to the impassibility of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, than for them to die first, and afterwards rise again from death to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is supremely wise will choose this way for those who shall be found living.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse36">1 Corinthians 15:36</a>): "That which thou sowest is not quickened except it die first," and he is speaking of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of the body as compared to the seed.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse22">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>): "As in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, so also in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> all shall be made alive." Now all shall be made alive in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore all shall die in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>: and so all shall rise again from death.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> differ in speaking on this question, as may be seen in the text (Sent. iv, D, 43). However, the safer and more common opinion is that all shall die and rise again from death: and this for three reasons. First, because it is more in accord with Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which condemned <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of its <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, that all who by the act of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> derive their origin from him should contract the stain of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, and consequently be the debtors of death. Secondly, because it is more in agreement with <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Divine Scripture</a> which foretells the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of all; and <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is not predicted properly except of that "which has fallen and perished," as the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv). Thirdly, because it is more in harmony with the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> where we find that what is corrupted and decayed is not renewed except by means of corruption: thus vinegar does not become wine unless the vinegar be corrupted and pass into the juice of the grape. Wherefore since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has incurred the defect of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of death, it cannot return to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> save by means of death. It is also in keeping with the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> for another reason, because, as it is stated in Phys. viii, 1, "the movement of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is as a kind of life to all <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," just as the movement of the heart is a kind of life of the whole body: wherefore even as all the members become dead on the heart ceasing to move, so when the heavenly movement ceases nothing can remain living with that life which was sustained by the influence of that movement. Now such is the life by which we live now: and therefore it follows that those who shall live after the movement of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> comes to a standstill must depart from this life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This distinction of the dead and the living does not apply to the time itself of the judgment, nor to the whole preceding time, since all who are to be judged were living at some time, and dead at some time: but it applies to that particular time which shall precede the judgment immediately, when, to wit, the signs of the judgment shall begin to appear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The perfect desire of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> cannot be void; but nothing prevents their conditional desire being void. Such is the desire whereby we would not be "unclothed," but "clothed upon," namely if that be possible: and this desire is called by some a "velleity."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> to say that any one except <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is conceived without <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, because those who would be conceived without <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> would not need the redemption which was wrought by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would not be the Redeemer of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> [See Editor's note which follows III, 26]. Nor can it be said that they needed not this redemption, because it was granted to them that they should be conceived without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For, this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was vouchsafed--either to their parents, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> might be healed in them (because so long as that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> remained they were unable to beget without communicating <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>)--or to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself which was healed. Now we must allow that every one needs the redemption of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> personally, and not only by reason of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and one cannot be delivered from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from a debt unless one incur the debt or incur the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and consequently all could not reap in themselves the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a>, unless all were born debtors and subject to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence the forgiveness of debts or delivery from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot be applied to one who is born without a debt or free from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but only to one who is born with a debt and is afterwards delivered by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Nor does it follow, if it can be asserted without <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that some die not, that they are born without <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, although death is a punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can of His mercy remit the punishment which one has incurred by a past fault, as He forgave the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> without punishment (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm">John 8)</a>: and in like manner He can deliver from death those who have contracted the debt of death by being born in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. And thus it does not follow that if they die not, therefore they were born without <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The shortest way is not always the one to be chosen, but only when it is more or equally adapted for attaining the end. It is not so here, as is clear from what we have said.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether all will rise again from ashes?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all will not rise again from ashes. For <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> is the exemplar of ours. Yet His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> was not from ashes, for His flesh saw not corruption according to <a href="../bible/psa015.htm#verse10">Psalm 15:10</a>; <a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse27">Acts 2:27-31</a>. Therefore neither will all rise again from ashes.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is not always burned. Yet a thing cannot be reduced to ashes unless it be burned. Therefore not all will rise again from ashes.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the body of a dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not reduced to ashes immediately after death. But some will rise again at once after death, according to the text (Sent. iv, D, 43), namely those who will be found living. Therefore all will not rise again from ashes.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the term "wherefrom" corresponds to the term "whereto." Now the term "whereto" of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is not the same in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: "We shall all indeed rise again, but we shall not all be changed" (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse51">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>). Therefore the term "wherefrom" is not the same. And thus, if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> rise again from ashes, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will not rise again from ashes.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07161a.htm">Haymo</a> says (on <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse10">Romans 5:10</a>, "For if when we were enemies"): "All who are born in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> lie under the sentence: Earth thou art and into earth shalt thou go." Now all who shall rise again at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">general resurrection</a> were born in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, either at their birth within the womb or at least at their birth from the womb. Therefore all will rise again from ashes.

<p>Further, there are many things in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body that do not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But all these will be removed. Therefore all bodies must needs be reduced to ashes.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The same reasons by which we have shown (1) that all rise again from death <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> also that at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">general resurrection</a> all will rise again from ashes, unless the contrary, such as the hastening of their <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, be vouchsafed to certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by a special privilege of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For just as <a href="../bible/index.html">holy writ</a> foretells the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, so does it foretell the reformation of bodies (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a>). And thus it follows that even as all die that the bodies of all may be able <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to rise again, so will the bodies of all perish that they may be able to be reformed. For just as death was inflicted by Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> as a punishment on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so was the decay of the body, as appears from <a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis 3:19</a>, "Earth thou art and into earth shalt thou go [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Dust thou art and into dust thou shalt return']."

<p>Moreover the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> requires the dissolution not only of the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, but also of the mingling of the elements: even as vinegar cannot be brought back to the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of wine unless it first be dissolved into the prejacent <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: for the mingling of the elements is both <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> and preserved by the movement of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and when this ceases all mixed bodies will be dissolved into pure elements.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> is the exemplar of ours as to the term "whereto," but not as to the term "wherefrom."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By ashes we mean all the remains that are left after the dissolution of the body--for two reasons. First, because it was the common custom in olden times to burn the bodies of the dead, and to keep the ashes, whence it became customary to speak of the remains of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body as ashes. Secondly, on account of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of dissolution, which is the flame of the fomes [Cf. I-II, 82, 3] whereby the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is radically infected. Hence, in order to be cleansed of this infection the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body must needs be dissolved into its primary components: and when a thing is destroyed by fire it is said to be reduced to ashes. wherefore the name of ashes is given to those things into which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is dissolved.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fire that will cleanse the face of the earth will be able to reduce suddenly to ashes the bodies of those that will be found living, even as it will dissolve other mixed bodies into their prejacent <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Movement does not take its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its term "wherefrom" but from its term "whereto." Hence the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> which will be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> must needs differ from the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> which will not be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, in respect of the term "whereto," and not in respect of the term "wherefrom." And it often happens that the term "whereto" is not the same, whereas the term "wherefrom" is the same--for instance, a thing may be moved from blackness to whiteness and to pallor.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the ashes from which the human body will be restored have any natural inclination towards the soul which will be united to them?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the ashes from which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body will be restored will have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination towards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which will be united to them. For if they had no inclination towards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, they would stand in the same relation to that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as other ashes. Therefore it would make no difference whether the body that is to be united to that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were restored from those ashes or from others: and this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the body is more dependent on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on the body. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body is still somewhat dependent on the body, wherefore its movement towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is retarded on account of its desire for the body, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii). Much more, therefore, has the body when separated from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination towards that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/job020.htm#verse11">Job 20:11</a>): "His bones shall be filled with the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of his youth, and they shall sleep with him in the dust." But <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are only in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore there will still remain in those ashes a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination towards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body can be dissolved into the very elements, or changed into the flesh of other animals. But the elements are homogeneous, and so is the flesh of a lion or other animal. Since then in the other parts of the elements or animals there is no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, neither will there be an inclination towards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in those parts into which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body has been changed. The first proposition is made evident on the authority of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion lxxxviii): "The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, although changed into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of other bodies or even into the elements, although it has become the food and flesh of any animals whatsoever, even of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, will in an instant return to that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which erstwhile animated it, making it a living and growing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p>Further, to every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination there corresponds a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent: else <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would fail in necessaries. Now the aforesaid ashes cannot be reunited to the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent. Therefore there is not in them any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to the aforesaid reunion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Opinion is threefold on this point. For some say that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is never dissolved into its very elements; and so there always remains in the ashes a certain force besides the elements, which gives a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But this assertion is in contradiction with the authority of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> quoted above, as well as with the senses and reason: since whatever is composed of contraries can be dissolved into its component parts. Wherefore others say that these parts of the elements into which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is dissolved retain more light, through having been united to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and for this reason have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. But this again is nonsensical, since the parts of the elements are of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and have an equal share of light and darkness. Hence we must say differently that in those ashes there is no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, but only by the ordering of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, which decreed that those ashes should be reunited to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: it is on this account that those parts of the elements shall be reunited and not others.

<p>Hence the Reply to the First Objection is clear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body remains in the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that it has when united to the body. It is not so with the body, and consequently the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These words of Job do not mean that the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> actually remain in the ashes of the dead, but that they remain according to the ordering of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereby those ashes are destined to the restoration of the body which will suffer <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed.
