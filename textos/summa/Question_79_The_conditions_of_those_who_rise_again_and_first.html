<h1>Question 79. The conditions of those who rise again, and first of their identity</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5079.htm#article1"> Will the body rise again identically the same?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5079.htm#article2"> Will it be the self-same man?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5079.htm#article3"> Is it necessary that the same ashes should return to the same parts in which they were before?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether in the resurrection the soul will be reunited to the same identical body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will not be reunited to the same identical body at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, for "thou sowest not the body that shall be, but bare grain" (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse37">1 Corinthians 15:37</a>). Now the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is there comparing death to sowing and <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> to fructifying. Therefore the same body that is laid aside in death is not resumed at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to every form some <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is adapted according to its condition, and likewise to every agent some instrument. Now the body is compared to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to form, and as instrument to agent. Since then at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will not be of the same condition as now (for it will be either entirely borne away to the heavenly life to which it adhered while living in the world, or will be cast down into the life of the brutes if it lived as a brute in this world) it would seem that it will not resume the same body, but either a heavenly or a brutish body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, after death, as stated above (Question 78, Article 3), the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is dissolved into the elements. Now these elemental parts into which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body has been dissolved do not agree with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body dissolved into them, except in primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, even as any other elemental parts agree with that same body. But if the body were to be formed from those other elemental parts, it would not be described as identically the same. Therefore neither will it be the self-same body if it be restored from these parts.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, there cannot be numerical identity where there is numerical distinction of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> parts. Now the form of the mixed body, which form is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, as being its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, cannot be resumed in numerical identity. Therefore the body will not be identically the same. The minor is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> thus: That which passes away into complete nonentity cannot be resumed in identity. This is clear from the fact that there cannot be identity where there is distinction of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>: and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, which is the act of a being, is differentiated by being interrupted, as is any interrupted act. Now the form of a mixed body passes away into complete nonentity by death, since it is a bodily form, and so also do the contrary <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> from which the mixture results. Therefore the form of a mixed body does not return in identity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job019.htm#verse26">Job 19:26</a>): "In my flesh I shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> my Saviour [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>']," where he is speaking of the vision after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, as appears from the preceding words: "In the last day I shall rise out of the earth." Therefore the selfsame body will rise again.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv, 27): "<a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection</a> is the second rising of that which has fallen." But the body which we have now fell by death. Therefore it will rise again the same identically.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> On this point the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> and certain modern <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>. For some of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> allowed that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> separated from bodies are reunited to bodies, yet they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in this in two ways. First, as to the mode of reunion, for some held the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> reunited to a body by the way of generation. Secondly, as to the body to which it was reunited, for they held that this second union was not with the selfsame body that was laid aside in death, but with another, sometimes of the same, sometimes of a different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Of a different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> while <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the body had led a life contrary to the ordering of reason: wherefore it passed after death from the body of a man into the body of some other animal to whose manner of living it had conformed in this life, for instance into the body of a dog on account of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, into the body of a lion on account of robbery and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and so forth--and into a body of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has led a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life in the body, and having after death experienced some <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, after some centuries began to wish to return to the body; and thus it was reunited to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body.

<p>This opinion arises from two <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> sources. The first of these is that they said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not united to the body <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> as form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as mover to the thing moved, [Cf. I, 76, 1] or as a man to his clothes. Hence it was possible for them to maintain that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> pre-existed before being infused into the body begotten of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation, as also that it is united to various bodies. The second is that they held <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> not to differ from sense except <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would be said to surpass other animals in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, because the sensitive power is more acute in him on account of the excellence of his bodily complexion; and hence it was possible for them to assert that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> passes into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a brute animal, especially when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been habituated to brutish actions. But these two sources are refuted by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, 1), and in consequence of these being refuted, it is clear that the above opinion is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p>In like manner the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are refuted. Some of them fell into the aforesaid opinions of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>: while others held that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are reunited to heavenly bodies, or again to bodies subtle as the wind, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> relates of a certain Bishop of Constantinople, in his exposition of <a href="../bible/job019.htm#verse26">Job 19:26</a>, "In my flesh I shall see my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," etc. Moreover these same <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> may be refuted by the fact that they are prejudicial to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> as witnessed to by <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. For we cannot call it <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> unless the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> return to the same body, since <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is a second rising, and the same thing rises that falls: wherefore <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> regards the body which after death falls rather than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which after death lives. And consequently if it be not the same body which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> resumes, it will not be a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, but rather the assuming of a new body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A comparison does not apply to every particular, but to some. For in the sowing of grain, the grain sown and the grain that is born thereof are neither identical, nor of the same condition, since it was first sown without a husk, yet is born with one: and the body will rise again identically the same, but of a different condition, since it was mortal and will rise in <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rising again and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> living in this world differ, not in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> but in respect of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and misery, which is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> difference. Hence it follows that the body in rising again differs, not in identity, but in condition, so that a difference of bodies corresponds proportionally to the difference of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which is understood as though it were in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> before its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> remains in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> after corruption, because when that which comes afterwards is removed that which came before may yet remain. Now, as the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> observes on the First Book of Physics and in De Substantia Orbis, in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of things subject to generation and corruption, we must presuppose undeterminate dimensions, by reason of which <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is divisible, so as to be able to receive various forms in its various parts. Wherefore after the separation of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, these dimensions still remain the same: and consequently the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> under those dimensions, whatever form it receive, is more identified with that which was generated from it, than any other part of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> under any form whatever. Thus the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> that will be brought back to restore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body will be the same as that body's previous <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Even as a simple <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of an element, but its proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, and the disposition whereby its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is rendered proper to such a form; so the form of a mixed body, which form is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> resulting from simple <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> reduced to a mean, is not the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the mixed body, but its proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, and the disposition whereby the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in need of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body has no <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form besides this form of the mixed body, except the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for if it had any previous <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, this would give it <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being, and would establish it in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>: so that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would be united to a body already established in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would be compared to the body as artificial forms are to their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in respect of their being established in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> by their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the body would be <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> refuted by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, 2 [Cf. I, 76, 1]. It would also follow that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body and each of its parts would not retain their former names in the same sense, which is contrary to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, 1). Therefore since the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remains, no <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body falls away into complete nonentity. And the variation of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> forms does not make a difference of identity. Therefore the selfsame body will rise again, since the selfsame <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is resumed as stated in a previous reply (ad 2).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it will be identically the same man that shall rise again?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it will not be identically the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that shall rise again. For according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Gener. ii): "Whatsoever things are changed in their corruptible <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> are not repeated identically." Now such is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in his present state. Therefore after the change wrought by death the self-same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be repeated.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, where there is a distinction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there is not the same identical <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> are two men and not one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since each has his own distinct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of one who rises again is distinct from that which he has now. Therefore he is not the same identical <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The minor can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in two ways. First, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which is the form of the whole is not both form and <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is, but is a form only. Now such like forms pass away into complete nonentity, and consequently they cannot be restored. Secondly, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> results from union of parts. Now the same identical union as that which was heretofore cannot be resumed, because repetition is opposed to identity, since repetition implies number, whereas identity implies unity, and these are incompatible with one another. But <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is a repeated union: therefore the union is not the same, and consequently there is not the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nor the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not several animals: wherefore if it is not the same animal it is not the same identical <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now where sense is not the same, there is not the same animal, since animal is defined from the primary sense, namely touch. But sense, as it does not remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (as some maintain), cannot be resumed in identity. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who rises again will not be the same identical animal, and consequently he will not be the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a statue ranks higher in the statue than the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a man does in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: because artificial things belong to the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> by reason of their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things by reason of their form, as appears from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. ii, 1), and again from the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> (De Anima ii). But if a statue is remade from the same brass, it will not be the same identically. Therefore much less will it be identically the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> if he be reformed from the same ashes.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job019.htm#verse27">Job 19:27</a>): "Whom I myself shall see . . . and not another," and he is speaking of the vision after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. Therefore the same identical <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will rise again.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. viii, 5) that "to rise again is naught else but to live again." Now unless the same identical <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that died return to life, he would not be said to live again. Therefore he would not rise again, which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of holding the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> arises from this--that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may obtain the last end for which he was made; for this cannot be accomplished in this life, nor in the life of the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (75, 1,2): otherwise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have been made in vain, if he were unable to obtain the end for which he was made. And since it behooves the end to be obtained by the selfsame thing that was made for that end, lest it appear to be made without purpose, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the selfsame <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to rise again; and this is effected by the selfsame <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being united to the selfsame body. For otherwise there would be no <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> properly speaking, if the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were not reformed. Hence to maintain that he who rises again is not the selfsame <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, since it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> which proclaims the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking of repetition by movement or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> change. For he shows the difference between the recurrence that occurs in generation and corruption and that which is observed in the movement of the heavens. Because the selfsame <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> by local movement returns to the beginning of its movement, since it has a moved incorruptible <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. On the other hand, things subject to generation and corruption return by generation to specific but not numerical identity, because from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> blood is engendered, from blood seed, and so on until a man is begotten, not the selfsame <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> specifically. In like manner from fire comes air, from air water, from water earth, whence fire is produced, not the selfsame fire, but the same in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Hence it is clear that the argument, so far as the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is concerned, is not to the point.

<p>We may also reply that the form of other things subject to generation and corruption is not subsistent of itself, so as to be able to remain after the corruption of the composite, as it is with the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even after separation from the body, retains the being which accrues to it when in the body, and the body is made to share that being by the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, since the being of the body and the being of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the body are not distinct from one another, otherwise the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body would be <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. Consequently there has been no interruption in the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as would make it impossible for the self-same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to return on account of an interruption in his being, as is the case with other things that are corrupted, the being of which is interrupted altogether, since their form remains not, and their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> remains under another being.

<p>Nevertheless neither does the self-same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> recur by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation, because the body of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> begotten is not composed of the whole body of his begetter: hence his body is numerically distinct, and consequently his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There are two opinions about humanity and about any form of a whole. For some say that the form of the whole and the form of the part are really one and the same: but that it is called the form of the part inasmuch as it perfects the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and the form of the whole inasmuch as the whole specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> results therefrom. According to this opinion humanity is really nothing else than the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and so, since the selfsame rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is resumed, there will be the same identical humanity, which will remain even after death, albeit not under the aspect of humanity, because the composite does not derive the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from a separated humanity.

<p>The other opinion, which seems nearer the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna's</a>, according to whom the form of the whole is not the form of a part only, nor some other form besides the form of the part, but is the whole resulting from the composition of form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, embracing both within itself. This form of the whole is called the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or quiddity. Since then at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> there will be the selfsame body, and the selfsame rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, there will be, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, the same humanity.

<p>The first argument <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> that there will be a distinction of humanity was based on the supposition that humanity is some distinct form supervening form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p>The second reason does not disprove the identity of humanity, because union implies action or passion, and though there be a different union, this cannot prevent the identity of humanity, because the action and passion from which humanity resulted are not of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of humanity, wherefore a distinction on their part does not involve a distinction of humanity: for it is clear that generation and <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> are not the self-same movement. Yet the identity of the rising <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with the begotten <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not hindered for this reason: and in like manner neither is the identity of humanity prevented if we take union for the relation itself: because this relation is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to but concomitant with humanity, since humanity is not one of those forms that are composition or order (Phys. ii, 1), as are the forms of things produced by art, so that if there be another distinct composition there is another distinct form of a house.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument affords a very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> against those who held a distinction between the sensitive and rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: because in that case the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not be incorruptible, as neither is it in other animals; and consequently in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> there would not be the same sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and consequently neither the same animal nor the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>But if we assert that in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is by its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> both rational and sensitive, we shall encounter no difficulty in this question, because animal is defined from sense, i.e. the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as from its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> form: whereas from sense, i.e. the sensitive power, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its definition as from an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form "that contributes more than another to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the quiddity" (De Anima i, 1). Accordingly after death there remains the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even as the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>: whereas the sensitive powers, according to some, do not remain. And since these powers are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> properties, diversity on their part cannot prevent the identity of the whole animal, not even of the animal's parts: nor are powers to be called perfections or acts of organs unless as principles of action, as heat in fire.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A statue may be considered in two ways, either as a particular <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, or as something artificial. And since it is placed in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it follows that if we consider it as a particular <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, it is the selfsame statue that is remade from the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. On the other hand, it is placed in the genus of artificial things inasmuch as it has an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form which, if the statue be destroyed, passes away also. Consequently it does not return identically the same, nor can the statue be identically the same. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> form, namely the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, remains after the body has perished: wherefore the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the ashes of the human body must needs, by the resurrection, return to the same parts of the body that were dissolved into them?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the ashes of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body to return, by the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, to the same parts that were dissolved into them. For, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, "as the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to the whole body, so is a part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to a part of the body, as sight to the pupil" (De Anima ii, 1). Now it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the body be resumed by the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore it is also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the same parts of the body to return to the same limbs, in which they were perfected by the same parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, difference of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> difference of identity. But if the ashes return not to the same parts, each part will not be remade from the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of which it consisted before. Therefore they will not be the same identically. Now if the parts are different the whole will also be different, since parts are to the whole as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is to form (Phys. ii, 3). Therefore it will not be the self-same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is directed to the end that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may receive the meed of his works. Now different parts of the body are employed in different works, whether of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or of demerit. Therefore at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> each part must needs return to its former state that it may be rewarded in due measure.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Artificial things are more dependent on their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> than <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things. Now in artificial things, in order that the same artificial thing be remade, from the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, there is no need for the parts to be brought back to the same position. Neither therefore is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>Further, change of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a change of identity. Now the situation of parts is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Therefore its change in a man does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a change of identity.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In this question it makes a difference whether we ask what can be done without prejudice to identity, and what will be done for the sake of congruity. As regards the first it must be observed that in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> we may speak of parts in two ways: first as of the various parts of a homogeneous whole, for instance the various parts of flesh, or the various parts of bone; secondly, as of various parts of various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a heterogeneous whole, for instance bone and flesh. Accordingly if it be said that one part of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> will return to another part of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> no change except in the position of the parts: and change of position of parts does not change the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in homogeneous wholes: and so if the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of one part return to another part, this is nowise prejudicial to the identity of the whole. Thus is it in the example given in the text (Sent. iv, D, 44), because a statue, after being remade, is identically the same, not as to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but as to its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in respect of which it is a particular <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and in this way a statue is homogeneous, although it is not according to its artificial form. But if it be said that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of one part returns to another part of another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that there is a change not only in the position of parts, but also in their identity: yet so that the whole <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or something belonging to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in one is transferred to another. but not if what was superfluous in one part is transferred to another. Now the identity of parts being taken away, the identity of the whole is removed, if we speak of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> parts, but not if we speak of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> parts, such as hair and nails, to which apparently <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> refers (De Civ. Dei xxii). It is thus clear how the transference of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from one part of another destroys the identity, and how it does not.

<p>But speaking of the congruity, it is more probable that even the parts will retain their position at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, especially as regards the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> and organic parts, although perhaps not as regards the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> parts, such as nails and hair.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers organic or heterogeneous parts, but no homogeneous or like parts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A change in the position of the parts of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a change of identity, although difference of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Operation, properly speaking, is not ascribed to the part but to the whole, wherefore the reward is due, not to the part but to the whole.
