<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether grace is bestowed through this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not bestowed through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> nourishment. But nourishment is only given to the living. Therefore since the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life is the effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> belongs only to one in the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not bestowed through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> for it to be had in the first instance. In like manner neither is it given so as <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be increased, because <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> growth belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a>, as stated above (Question 72, Article 1). Consequently, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not bestowed through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given as a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> refreshment. But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> refreshment seems to belong to the use of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> rather than to its bestowal. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not given through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as was said above (Question 74, Article 1), "Christ's body is offered up in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the body, and His blood for that of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Now it is not the body which is the subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as was shown in I-II, 110, 4. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not bestowed through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, at least so far as the body is concerned.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse52">John 6:52</a>): "The bread which I will give, is My flesh for the life of the world." But the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life is the effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is bestowed through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought to be considered, first of all and principally, from what is contained in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which is Christ; Who, just as by coming into the world, He visibly bestowed the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> upon the world, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John 1:17</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>," so also, by coming sacramentally into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse58">John 6:58</a>: "He that eateth Me, the same also shall live by Me." Hence Cyril says on <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse19">Luke 22:19</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> life-giving Word by uniting Himself with His own flesh, made it to be productive of life. For it was becoming that He should be united somehow with bodies through His sacred flesh and precious blood, which we receive in a life-giving <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> in the bread and wine."

<p>Secondly, it is considered on the part of what is represented by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, as stated above (74, 1; 76, 2, ad 1). And therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> works in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the effect which <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> wrought in the world. Hence, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says on the words, "Immediately there came out blood and water" (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse34">John 19:34</a>): "Since the sacred mysteries derive their origin from thence, when you draw nigh to the awe-inspiring <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, so approach as if you were going to drink from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own side." Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself says (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse28">Matthew 26:28</a>): "This is My blood . . . which shall be shed for many unto the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p>Thirdly, the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is considered from the way in which this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given; for it is given by way of food and drink. And therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does for the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life all that material food does for the bodily life, namely, by sustaining, giving increase, restoring, and giving delight. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. v): "This is the bread of everlasting life, which supports the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." And <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xlvi in Joan.): "When we desire it, He lets us feel Him, and eat Him, and embrace Him." And hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse56">John 6:56</a>): "My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed."

<p>Fourthly, the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is considered from the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> under which it is given. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> betokened His body and blood in things which out of many units are made into some one whole: for out of many grains is one thing made," viz. bread; "and many grapes flow into one thing," viz. wine. And therefore he observes elsewhere (Tract. xxvi in Joan.): "O sacrament of piety, O sign of unity, O bond of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>!"

<p>And since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. and since <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> refreshment, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it is clear from all that has been set forth that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> bestows <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This sacrament has of itself the power of bestowing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; nor does anyone possess <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> before receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> except from some desire thereof; from his own desire, as in the case of the adult. or from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> desire in the case of children, as stated above (Question 73, Article 3). Hence it is due to the efficacy of its power, that even from desire thereof a man procures <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby he is enabled to lead the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life. It remains, then, that when the sacrament itself is really received, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is increased, and the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life perfected: yet in different fashion from the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is increased and perfected for resisting the outward assaults of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> enemies. But by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> receives increase, and the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life is perfected, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may stand perfect in himself by union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This sacrament confers <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> spiritually together with the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iv) compares this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to the burning coal which Isaias saw (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse6">Isaiah 6:6</a>): "For a live ember is not simply wood, but wood united to fire; so also the bread of communion is not simple bread but bread united with the Godhead." But as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> observes in a Homily for Pentecost, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love is never idle; for, wherever it is it does great works." And consequently through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as far as its power is concerned, not only is the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> bestowed, but it is furthermore aroused to act, according to <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 5:14</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> presseth us." Hence it is that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is spiritually nourished through the power of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, by being spiritually gladdened, and as it were inebriated with the sweetness of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, according to <a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse1">Canticles 5:1</a>: "Eat, O friends, and drink, and be inebriated, my dearly beloved."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Because the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> operate according to the similitude by which they signify, therefore by way of assimilation it is said that in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> "the body is offered for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the body, and the blood for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," although each works for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of both, since the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is under each, as stated above (Question 76, Article 2). And although the body is not the immediate subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, still the effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> flows into the body while in the present life we present "our [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'your'] members" as "instruments of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse13">Romans 6:13</a>), and in the life to come our body will share in the incorruption and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the attaining of glory is an effect of this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the attaining of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is not an effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For an effect is proportioned to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> belongs to "wayfarers" [viatoribus, and hence it is termed "Viaticum." Since, then, wayfarers are not yet capable of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, it seems that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the attaining of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, given sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the effect follows. But many take this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> who will never come to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Civ. Dei xxi). Consequently, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of attaining unto <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greater is not brought about by the lesser, for nothing acts outside its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But it is the lesser thing to receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> under a strange <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which happens in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, than to enjoy Him in His own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the attaining of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse52">John 6:52</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> eat of this bread, he shall live for ever." But <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> is the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore the attaining of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is an effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> we may consider both that from which it derives its effect, namely, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> contained in it, as also His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> represented by it; and that through which it works its effect, namely, the use of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>Now as to both of these it belongs to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the attaining of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Because it was by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> opened to us the approach to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse15">Hebrews 9:15</a>: "He is the Mediator of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; that by means of His death . . . they that are called may receive the promise of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> inheritance." Accordingly in the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> it is said: "This is the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of My blood, of the New and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Testament."

<p>In like manner the refreshment of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food and the unity denoted by the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the bread and wine are to be had in the present life, although imperfectly. but perfectly in the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on the words, "My flesh is meat indeed" (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse56">John 6:56</a>): "Seeing that in meat and drink, men aim at this, that they hunger not nor thirst, this verily nought doth afford save only this meat and drink which maketh them who partake thereof to be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and incorruptible, in the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, where shall be peace, and unity, full and perfect."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereof this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is accomplished, is indeed the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, yet not so that we are thereby forthwith admitted to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but we must first "suffer with Him in order that we may also be glorified" afterwards "with Him" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse17">Romans 8:17</a>), so this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not at once admit us to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but bestows on us the power of coming unto <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And therefore it is called "Viaticum," a figure whereof we read in <a href="../bible/1ki019.htm#verse8">1 Kings 19:8</a>: "Elias ate and drank, and walked in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights unto the mount of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Horeb."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> has not its effect in them who are not disposed towards it as they should be, so also they do not come to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> who receive it unworthily. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. xxvi in Joan.), expounding the same passage, observes: "The sacrament is one thing, the power of the sacrament another. Many receive it from the altar . . . and by receiving" . . . die . . . Eat, then, spiritually the heavenly "bread, bring innocence to the altar." It is no wonder, then, if those who do not keep innocence, do not secure the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is received under another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which acts instrumentally. But there is nothing to prevent an instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> from producing a more mighty effect, as is evident from what was said above (77, 3, ad 3).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the forgiveness of mortal sin is an effect of this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the forgiveness of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For it is said in one of the Collects (Postcommunion, Pro vivis et defunctis): "May this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> be a cleansing from crimes." But mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are called crimes. Therefore mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are blotted out by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, like <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, works by the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. But mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as stated above (Question 69, Article 1). Therefore they are forgiven likewise by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, especially since in the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> it is said: "Which shall be shed for many unto the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is bestowed through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> a man is justified from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse24">Romans 3:24</a>: "Being justified freely by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Therefore mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse29">1 Corinthians 11:29</a>): "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself": and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of the same passage makes the following commentary: "He eats and drinks unworthily who is in the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or who handles (the sacrament) irreverently; and such a one eats and drinks judgment, i.e. damnation, unto himself." Therefore, he that is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by taking the sacrament heaps <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> upon <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, rather than obtains forgiveness of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The power of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can be considered in two ways. First of all, in itself: and thus this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> has from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> the power of forgiving all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is the fount and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>Secondly, it can be considered in comparison with the recipient of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, in so far as there is, or is not, found in him an obstacle to receiving the fruit of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now whoever is conscious of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, has within him an obstacle to receiving the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; since he is not a proper recipient of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, both because he is not alive spiritually, and so he ought not to eat the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> nourishment, since nourishment is confined to the living; and because he cannot be united with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as long as he retains an attachment towards mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently, as is said in the book De Eccles. Dogm.: "If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> leans towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is burdened rather than purified from partaking of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>." Hence, in him who is conscious of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Nevertheless this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can effect the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in two ways. First of all, by being received, not actually, but in desire; as when a man is first justified from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Secondly, when received by one in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which he is not conscious, and for which he has no attachment; since possibly he was not sufficiently <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> at first, but by approaching this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> devoutly and reverently he obtains the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which will perfect his <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> and bring forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We ask that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> may be the "cleansing of crimes," or of those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of which we are unconscious, according to <a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse13">Psalm 18:13</a>: "Lord, cleanse me from my hidden <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>"; or that our <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> may be perfected for the forgiveness of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; or that strength be bestowed on us to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> generation, which is a transition from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> non-being into <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> being, and is given by way of ablution. Consequently, in both respects he who is conscious of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not improperly approach <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> within himself by way of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> nourishment, which is unbecoming to one that lies dead in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore the comparison does not hold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> is the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; yet it does not forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> except when it is first bestowed on the sinner. But it is not given so in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether venial sins are forgiven through this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not forgiven by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because this is the "sacrament of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.). But venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as was shown in I-II, 88, 1,2; II-II, 24, 10. Therefore, since contrary is taken away by its contrary, it seems that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not forgiven by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be forgiven by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, then all of them are forgiven for the same reason as one is. But it does not appear that all are forgiven, because thus one might frequently be without any venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, against what is said in <a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1 John 1:8</a>: "If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves." Therefore no venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, contraries mutually exclude each other. But venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not forbid the receiving of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: because <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on the words, "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> eat of it he shall [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'may'] not die for ever" (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse50">John 6:50</a>): "Bring innocence to the altar: your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, though they be daily . . . let them not be deadly." Therefore neither are venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> taken away by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> says (De S. Alt. Myst. iv) that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> "blots out venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and wards off mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things may be considered in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, to wit, the sacrament itself, and the reality of the sacrament: and it appears from both that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> has the power of forgiving venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is received under the form of nourishing food. Now nourishment from food is requisite for the body to make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> the daily waste <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the action of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat. But something is also lost daily of our spirituality from the heat of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> through venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which lessen the fervor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as was shown in the II-II, 24, 10. And therefore it belongs to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to forgive venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. v) that this daily bread is taken "as a remedy against daily infirmity."

<p>The reality of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, not only as to its <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but also as to its act, which is kindled in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; and by this means venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven. Consequently, it is manifest that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven by the power of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, although not opposed to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, are nevertheless opposed to the fervor of its act, which act is kindled by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; by reason of which act venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are blotted out.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passage quoted is not to be understood as if a man could not at some time be without all guilt of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but that the just do not pass through this life without committing venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The power of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to which this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> belongs, is greater than that of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> by its act takes away venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which nevertheless cannot entirely hinder the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. And the same holds good of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the entire punishment due to sin is forgiven through this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the entire punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives the effect of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> within himself as stated above (1,2), just as he does through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives forgiveness of all punishment, through the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, which satisfied sufficiently for all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as was explained above (69, 2). Therefore it seems the whole debt of punishment is forgiven through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01285c.htm">Pope Alexander I</a> says (Ep. ad omnes orth.): "No sacrifice can be greater than the body and the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> satisfied for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the old Law: for it is written (<a href="../bible/lev004.htm">Leviticus 4</a>, <a href="../bible/lev005.htm">5</a>): "If a man shall <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, let him offer" (so and so) "for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and it shall be forgiven him." Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> avails much more for the forgiveness of all punishment.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that some part of the debt of punishment is forgiven by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; for which reason it is sometimes enjoined upon a man, by way of satisfaction, to have masses said for himself. But if one part of the punishment is forgiven, for the same reason is the other forgiven: owing to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power contained in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Consequently, it seems that the whole punishment can be taken away by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In that case no other punishment would have to be enjoined; just as none is imposed upon the newly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This sacrament is both a sacrifice and a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. it has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a sacrifice inasmuch as it is offered up; and it has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> inasmuch as it is received. And therefore it has the effect of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in the recipient, and the effect of a sacrifice in the offerer, or in them for whom it is offered.

<p>If, then, it be considered as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it produces its effect in two ways: first of all directly through the power of the sacrament; secondly as by a kind of concomitance, as was said above regarding what is contained in the sacrament (76, 1,2). Through the power of the sacrament it produces directly that effect for which it was instituted. Now it was instituted not for satisfaction, but for nourishing spiritually through union between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His members, as nourishment is united with the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> nourished. But because this union is the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, from the fervor of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> obtains forgiveness, not only of guilt but also of punishment, hence it is that as a consequence, and by concomitance with the chief effect, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> obtains forgiveness of the punishment, not indeed of the entire punishment, but according to the measure of his devotion and fervor.

<p>But in so far as it is a sacrifice, it has a satisfactory power. Yet in satisfaction, the affection of the offerer is weighed rather than the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the offering. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/mar012.htm#verse43">Mark 12:43</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse4">Luke 21:4</a>) of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who offered "two mites" that she "cast in more than all." Therefore, although this offering suffices of its own <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> to satisfy for all punishment, yet it becomes satisfactory for them for whom it is offered, or even for the offerers, according to the measure of their devotion, and not for the whole punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is directly ordained for the remission of punishment and guilt: not so the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as dying with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whereas the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is given as by way of nourishing and perfecting him through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consequently there is no parallel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those other <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and oblations did not effect the forgiveness of the whole punishment, neither as to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the thing offered, as this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does, nor as to personal devotion; from which it comes to pass that even here the whole punishment is not taken away.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If part of the punishment and not the whole be taken away by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it is due to a defect not on the part of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power, but on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> devotion.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether man is preserved by this sacrament from future sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not preserved by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> from future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For there are many that receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> worthily, who afterwards fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now this would not happen if this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> were to preserve them from future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Consequently, it is not an effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to preserve from future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not seem to preserve from future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because it can be lost through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after one has possessed it, as was stated in the II-II, 24, 11. Therefore it seems that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not preserve <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the origin of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> within us is "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is in our members," as declared by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans 7:23</a>). But the lessening of the fomes, which is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is set down as an effect not of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but rather of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore preservation from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not an effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse50">John 6:50</a>): "This is the bread which cometh down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; that if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> eat of it, he may not die": which manifestly is not to be understood of the death of the body. Therefore it is to be understood that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> preserves from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> death, which is through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sin is the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is preserved from future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the same way as the body is preserved from future death of the body: and this happens in two ways. First of all, in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is strengthened inwardly against inner decay, and so by means of food and medicine he is preserved from death. Secondly, by being guarded against outward assaults; and thus he is protected by means of arms by which he defends his body.

<p>Now this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> preserves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in both of these ways. For, first of all, by uniting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it strengthens his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, as <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> medicine, according to <a href="../bible/psa103.htm#verse5">Psalm 103:5</a>: "(That) bread strengthens [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'may strengthen'] <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart." <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> likewise says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.): "Approach without fear; it is bread, not poison." Secondly, inasmuch as it is a sign of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> are conquered, it repels all the assaults of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xlvi in Joan.): "Like lions breathing forth fire, thus do we depart from that table, being made terrible to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is received according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>: such is the case with every active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in that its effect is received in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But such is the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on earth that his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> can be bent to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence, although this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of itself has the power of preserving from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet it does not take away from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the possibility of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of itself keeps <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans 13:10</a>: "The love of our neighbor worketh no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>": but it is due to the mutability of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> that a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> after possessing <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, just as after receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not ordained directly to lessen the fomes, yet it does lessen it as a consequence, inasmuch as it increases <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (83), "the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the lessening of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>." But it directly strengthens <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; whereby he is also preserved from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether this sacrament benefit others besides the recipients?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> benefits only the recipients. For this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is of the same genus as the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, being one of those into which that genus is divided. But the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> only benefit the recipients; thus the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> alone receives effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore, neither does this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> benefit others than the recipients.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the effects of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> are the attainment of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, at least of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> were to produce its effects in others besides the recipients, a man might happen to acquire <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without doing or receiving anything himself, through another receiving or offering this sacrament.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is multiplied, the effect is likewise multiplied. If therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> benefit others besides the recipients, it would follow that it benefits a man more if he receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> through many hosts being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in one mass, whereas this is not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> custom: for instance, that many receive communion for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Consequently, it does not seem that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> benefits anyone but the recipient.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> is made for many others during the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; which would serve no purpose were the sacrament not beneficial to others. Therefore, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is beneficial not merely to them who receive it.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not only a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but also a sacrifice. For, it has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a sacrifice inasmuch as in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is represented, whereby <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "offered Himself a Victim to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians 5:2</a>), and it has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> inasmuch as invisible <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is bestowed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> under a visible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. So, then, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> benefits recipients by way both of sacrament and of sacrifice, because it is offered for all who partake of it. For it is said in the Canon of the Mass: "May as many of us as, by participation at this Altar, shall receive the most sacred body and blood of Thy Son, be filled with all heavenly benediction and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>."

<p>But to others who do not receive it, it is beneficial by way of sacrifice, inasmuch as it is offered for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Hence it is said in the Canon of the Mass: "Be mindful, O Lord, of Thy servants, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> . . . for whom we offer, or who offer up to Thee, this sacrifice of praise for themselves and for all their own, for the redemption of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, for the hope of their safety and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>." And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> expressed both ways, saying (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse28">Matthew 26:28</a>, with <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse20">Luke 22:20</a>): "Which for you," i.e. who receive it, "and for many," i.e. others, "shall be shed unto remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This sacrament has this in addition to the others, that it is a sacrifice: and therefore the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> benefits all, for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the attaining of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, whereas it produces no effect except in those who are united with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so likewise this sacrifice, which is the memorial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, has no effect except in those who are united with this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says to Renatus (De Anima et ejus origine i): "Who may offer Christ's body except for them who are Christ's members?" Hence in the Canon of the Mass no <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is made for them who are outside the pale of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But it benefits them who are members, more or less, according to the measure of their devotion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Receiving is of the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but offering belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of sacrifice: consequently, when one or even several receive the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, no help accrues to others. In like fashion even when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> consecrates several hosts in one mass, the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not increased, since there is only one sacrifice; because there is no more power in several hosts than in one, since there is only one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> present under all the hosts and under one. Hence, neither will any one receive greater effect from the sacrament by taking many <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> hosts in one mass. But the oblation of the sacrifice is multiplied in several masses, and therefore the effect of the sacrifice and of the sacrament is multiplied.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the effect of this sacrament is hindered by venial sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not hindered by venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. xxvi in Joan.), <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse52">John 6:52</a>, "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> eat of this bread," etc., says: "Eat the heavenly bread spiritually; bring innocence to the altar; your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, though they be daily, let them not be deadly." From this it is evident that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which are called daily <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, do not prevent <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating. But they who eat spiritually, receive the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not hinder the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not less powerful than <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But, as stated above (69, 9,10), only pretense checks the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not belong to pretense; because according to <a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse5">Wisdom 1:5</a>: "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of discipline will flee from the deceitful," yet He is not put to flight by venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore neither do venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> hinder the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing which is removed by the action of any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, can hinder the effect of such <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are taken away by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore, they do not hinder its effect.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv): "The fire of that desire which is within us, being kindled by the burning coal," i.e. this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, "will consume our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and enlighten our hearts, so that we shall be inflamed and made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godlike</a>." But the fire of our desire or love is hindered by venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which hinder the fervor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as was shown in I-II, 81, 4; II-II, 24, 10. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> hinder the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be taken in two ways: first of all as past, secondly as in the act of being committed. Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> taken in the first way do not in any way hinder the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For it can come to pass that after many venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> a man may approach devoutly to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and fully secure its effect. Considered in the second way venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not utterly hinder the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but merely in part. For, it has been stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), that the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not only the obtaining of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but also a certain actual refreshment of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sweetness: which is indeed hindered if anyone approach to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> with mind distracted through venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but the increase of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not taken away.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He that approaches this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> with actual venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, eats spiritually indeed, in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> but not in act: and therefore he shares in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> effect of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but not in its actual effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not ordained, as this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is, for the fervor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as its actual effect. Because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, through which the first perfection is acquired, which is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or form; but this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating, which has actual delight.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument deals with past venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which are taken away by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.
