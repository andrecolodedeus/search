<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether God is a cause of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says of certain ones (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse28">Romans 1:28</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not right [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'convenient']," and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> comments on this by saying that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in men's hearts, by inclining their wills to whatever He wills, whether to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in doing what is not right, and in having a will inclined to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse11">Wisdom 14:11</a>): "The creatures of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are turned to an abomination; and a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." But a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> usually denotes a provocation to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Since therefore creatures were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, as was established in the I, 44, 1, it seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by provoking <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the effect. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, which itself is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But it is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> that He should <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment; since of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> it is written (<a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse7">Isaiah 45:7</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> creates <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and (<a href="../bible/amo003.htm#verse6">Amos 3:6</a>): "Shall there be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the city which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the Lord'] hath not done?" Therefore it is not incompatible with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> that He should <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse25">Wisdom 11:25</a>): "Thou . . . hatest none of the things which Thou hast made." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse9">Wisdom 14:9</a>: "To <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> are hateful." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is, in two ways, a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> either of his own or of another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. First, directly, namely by inclining his or another's will to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; secondly, indirectly, namely by not preventing someone from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Hence (<a href="../bible/eze003.htm#verse18">Ezekiel 3:18</a>) it is said to the watchman: "If thou say not to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: 'Thou shalt surely die' [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: "If, when I say to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, 'Thou shalt surely die,' thou declare it not to him."] . . . I will require his blood at thy hand." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be directly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either in Himself or in another, since every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a departure from the order which is to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the end: whereas <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> inclines and turns all things to Himself as to their last end, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. i): so that it is impossible that He should be either to Himself or to another the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of departing from the order which is to Himself. Therefore He cannot be directly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In like manner neither can He <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> indirectly. For it happens that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not give some the assistance, whereby they may avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which assistance were He to give, they would not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But He does all this according to the order of His wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since He Himself is Wisdom and Justice: so that if someone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> it is not imputable to Him as though He were the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; even as a pilot is not said to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the wrecking of the ship, through not steering the ship, unless he cease to steer while able and bound to steer. It is therefore evident that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is nowise a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As to the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, the solution is clear from the text. For if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> delivered some up to a reprobate sense, it follows that they already had a reprobate sense, so as to do what was not right. Accordingly He is said to deliver them up to a reprobate sense, in so far as He does not hinder them from following that reprobate sense, even as we are said to expose a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to danger if we do not protect him. The saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Grat. et Lib. Arb. xxi, whence the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> quoted is taken) to the effect that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> inclines men's wills to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," is to be understood as meaning that He inclines the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> directly to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in so far as He does not hinder it, as stated above. And yet even this is due as being deserved through a previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When it is said the "creatures of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are turned 'to' an abomination, and a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>," the preposition "to" does not denote <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> but sequel [This is made clear by the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay Version</a>: the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> "factae sunt in abominationem" admits of the translation "were made to be an abomination," which might imply <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>.]; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not make the creatures that they might be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; this was the result of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> folly, wherefore the text goes on to say, "and a snare to the feet of the unwise," who, to wit, in their folly, use creatures for a purpose other than that for which they were made.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The effect which proceeds from the middle <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, according as it is subordinate to the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is reduced to that first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; but if it proceed from the middle <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, according as it goes outside the order of the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it is not reduced to that first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: thus if a servant do anything contrary to his master's orders, it is not ascribed to the master as though he were the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof. In like manner <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> commits against the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as being its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Punishment is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> punished, who is thereby deprived of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or other: but fault is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of subordination to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and so it is directly opposed to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; consequently there is no comparison between fault and punishment.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the act of sin is from God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Perfect. Justit. ii) that "the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not a thing." Now whatever is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a thing. Therefore the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not said to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except because he is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act: for "no one works, intending <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, some actions are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as was shown above (18, A2,8). Now whatever is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a thing, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> whatever belongs to it in respect of its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. If therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He would be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Now "the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every movement," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Trin. iii, 4,9). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is both a being and an act; and in both respects it is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because every being, whatever the mode of its being, must be derived from the First Being, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Div. Nom. v). Again every action is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in act, since nothing produces an action save in so far as it is in act; and every being in act is reduced to the First Act, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, Who is act by His Essence. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every action, in so far as it is an action. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> denotes a being and an action with a defect: and this defect is from the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, viz. the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, as falling away from the order of the First Agent, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently this defect is not reduced to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>: even as the defect of limping is reduced to a crooked leg as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but not to the motive power, which nevertheless <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> whatever there is of movement in the limping. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and yet He is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because He does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the act to have a defect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In this passage <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> calls by the name of "thing," that which is a thing simply, viz. <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; for in this sense the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not a thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not only the act, but also the defect, is reduced to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which defect consists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> not being subject to Whom he ought to be, although he does not intend this principally. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: while <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the act, in such a way, that nowise is He the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the defect accompanying the act, so that He is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 72, Article 1), acts and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> do not take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the privation itself, wherein consists the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but from some object, to which that privation is united: and so this defect which consists in not being from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the act consequently, and not as a specific difference.

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> blindness and hardness of heart. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 3) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that which makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> worse. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made worse by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> blindness and hardness of heart. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> blindness and hardness of heart.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Fulgentius says (De Dupl. Praedest. i, 19): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not punish what He <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> punishes the hardened heart, according to <a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse27">Sirach 3:27</a>: "A hard heart shall fear <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> at the last." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hardness of heart.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same effect is not put down to contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> blindness is said to be the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse21">Wisdom 2:21</a>: "For their own <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> blinded them," and again, according to <a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>: "The god of this world hath blinded the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of unbelievers": which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> seem to be opposed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> blindness and hardness of heart.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse10">Isaiah 6:10</a>): "Blind the heart of this people, and make their ears heavy," and <a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse18">Romans 9:18</a>: "He hath mercy on whom He will, and whom He will He hardeneth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Spiritual blindness and hardness of heart imply two things. One is the movement of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind in cleaving to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and turning away from the Divine light; and as regards this, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> blindness and hardness of heart, just as He is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The other thing is the withdrawal of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the result of which is that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is not enlightened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to see aright, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart is not softened to live aright; and as regards this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> blindness and hardness of heart.

<p>Now we must consider that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the enlightening of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John 1:9</a>: "That was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light which enlighteneth every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that cometh into this world," even as the sun is the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the enlightening of bodies, though not in the same way; for the sun enlightens by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works freely, through the order of His wisdom. Now although the sun, so far as it is concerned, enlightens all bodies, yet if it be encountered by an obstacle in a body, it leaves it in darkness, as happens to a house whose window-shutters are closed, although the sun is in no way the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the house being darkened, since it does not act of its own accord in failing to light up the interior of the house; and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this is the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who closed the shutters. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of His own accord, withholds His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from those in whom He finds an obstacle: so that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> being withheld is not only the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who raises an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who, of His own accord, withholds His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. In this way, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> blindness, deafness of ear, and hardness of heart.

<p>These differ from one another in respect of the effects of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which both perfects the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom, and softens the affections by the fire of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. And since two of the senses excel in rendering service to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, viz. sight and hearing, of which the former assists "discovery," and the latter, "teaching," hence it is that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> "blindness" corresponds to sight, "heaviness of the ears" to hearing, and "hardness of heart" to the affections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Blindness and hardheartedness, as regards the withholding of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, are punishments, and therefore, in this respect, they make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> no worse. It is because he is already worsened by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that he incurs them, even as other punishments.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers hardheartedness in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Malice is the demeritorious <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of blindness, just as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of punishment: and in this way too, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is said to blind, in so far as he induces <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether blindness and hardness of heart are directed to the salvation of those who are blinded and hardened?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that blindness and hardness of heart are always directed to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those who are blinded and hardened. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xi) that "as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, He would nowise allow <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be done, unless He could draw some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Much more, therefore, does He direct to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of which He Himself is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of blindness and hardness of heart, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore they are directed to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those who are blinded and hardened.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse13">Wisdom 1:13</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath no pleasure in the destruction of the ungodly [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made not death, neither hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living.']." Now He would seem to take pleasure in their destruction, if He did not turn their blindness to their profit: just as a physician would seem to take pleasure in torturing the invalid, if he did not intend to heal the invalid when he prescribes a bitter medicine for him. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> turns blindness to the profit of those who are blinded.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>" (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse34">Acts 10:34</a>). Now He directs the blinding of some, to their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as in the case of some of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, who were blinded so as not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and, through not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, to slay Him, and afterwards were seized with compunction, and <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, as related by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Quaest. Evang. iii). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> turns all blindness to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare of those who are blinded.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> On the other hand, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse8">Romans 3:8</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should not be done, that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may ensue. Now blindness is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not blind some for the sake of their welfare.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Blindness is a kind of preamble to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has a twofold relation--to one thing directly, viz. to the sinner's damnation--to another, by reason of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy or <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, viz. that the sinner may be healed, in so far as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> permits some to fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that by acknowledging their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they may be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> and <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Nat. et Grat. xxii). Therefore blindness, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is directed to the damnation of those who are blinded; for which reason it is accounted an effect of reprobation. But, through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy, temporary blindness is directed medicinally to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare of those who are blinded. This mercy, however, is not vouchsafed to all those who are blinded, but only to the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, to whom "all things work together unto <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans 8:28</a>). Therefore as regards some, blindness is directed to their healing; but as regards others, to their damnation; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Quaest. Evang. iii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does, or permits to be done, is directed to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; yet not always to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of those in whom the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is, but sometimes to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others, or of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>: thus He directs the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of tyrants to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and the punishment of the lost to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not take pleasure in the loss of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as regards the loss itself, but by reason of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that ensues from the loss.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> directs the blindness of some to their <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare, is due to His mercy; but that the blindness of others is directed to their loss is due to His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and that He vouchsafes His mercy to some, and not to all, does not make <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as explained in the I, 23, 5, ad 3.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> of fault must not be done, that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may ensue; but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment must be inflicted for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.
