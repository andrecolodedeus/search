<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the intellect is a power of the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> seems to be the same as the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is not a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ix, 2): "Mind and spirit are not relative things, but denominate the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, different genera of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers are not united in some one power, but only in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> are different genera of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 3), but they are united in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. x, 11) places the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> and will in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is of the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and not a power thereof.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> (xxix in Ev.), "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> understands with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are called "minds" and "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are not a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> by the fact that it is immaterial. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is immaterial through its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must be <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> through its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> assigns the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> faculty as a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (De Anima ii, 3).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In accordance with what has been already shown (54, 3; 77, 1) it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and not the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For then alone the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of that which operates is the immediate principle of operation, when operation itself is its being: for as power is to operation as its act, so is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> to being. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone His action of understanding is His very Being. Wherefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>: while in other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> creatures, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sense is sometimes taken for the power, and sometimes for the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> takes its name from its chief power, which is sense. And in like manner the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sometimes called <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as from its chief power; and thus we read (De Anima i, 4), that the "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." And in this sense also <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is spirit and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> (De Trin. ix, 2; xiv, 16).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> powers are different genera of powers in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by reason of the different formalities of their objects. But the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power agrees partly with the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power and partly with the sensitive in its mode of operation either through a corporeal organ or without it: for <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> follows apprehension. And in this way <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> puts the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, in the reason (De Anima iii, 9).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there is no other power besides the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which follows the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And for this reason an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is called a "mind" or an "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>"; because his whole power consists in this. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has many other powers, such as the sensitive and nutritive powers, and therefore the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The immateriality of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is not its <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and through its immateriality it has the power of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>. Wherefore it follows not that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but that it is its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and power.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the intellect is a passive power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not a passive power. For everything is passive by its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and acts by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power results from the immateriality of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not a passive power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power is incorruptible, as we have said above (Question 79, Article 6). But "if the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is passive, it is corruptible" (De Anima iii, 5). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power is not passive.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the "agent is nobler than the patient," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16) and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Anima iii, 5) says. But all the powers of the vegetative part are active; yet they are the lowest among the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Much more, therefore, all the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> powers, which are the highest, are active.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 4) that "to understand is in a way to be passive."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To be passive may be taken in three ways.

<p>Firstly, in its most strict sense, when from a thing is taken something which belongs to it by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> either of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or of its proper inclination: as when water loses coolness by heating, and as when a man becomes ill or sad.

<p>Secondly, less strictly, a thing is said to be passive, when something, whether suitable or unsuitable, is taken away from it. And in this way not only he who is ill is said to be passive, but also he who is healed; not only he that is sad, but also he that is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyful</a>; or whatever way he be altered or moved.

<p>Thirdly, in a wide sense a thing is said to be passive, from the very fact that what is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to something receives that to which it was in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, without being deprived of anything. And accordingly, whatever passes from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, may be said to be passive, even when it is perfected. And thus with us to understand is to be passive. This is clear from the following reason. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as we have seen above (Question 78, Article 1), has an operation extending to universal being. We may therefore see whether the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> be in act or <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> by observing first of all the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the relation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to universal being. For we find an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> whose relation to universal being is that of the act of all being: and such is the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is the Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which originally and virtually, all being pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> as in its first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And therefore the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, but is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>. But no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can be an act in relation to the whole universal being; otherwise it would needs be an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> being. Wherefore every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not the act of all things intelligible, by reason of its very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; but is compared to these intelligible things as a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act.

<p>Now, <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> has a double relation to act. There is a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> which is always perfected by its act: as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the heavenly bodies (58, 1). And there is another <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> which is not always in act, but proceeds from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act; as we observe in things that are corrupted and generated. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is always in act as regards those things which it can understand, by reason of its proximity to the first <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>, as we have said above. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is the lowest in the order of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> and most remote from the perfection of the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> with regard to things intelligible, and is at first "like a clean tablet on which nothing is written," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 4). This is made clear from the fact, that at first we are only in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to understand, and afterwards we are made to understand actually. And so it is evident that with us to understand is "in a way to be passive"; taking passion in the third sense. And consequently the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a passive power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection is verified of passion in the first and second senses, which belong to primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But in the third sense passion is in anything which is reduced from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> "Passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>" is the name given by some to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, in which are the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; which <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is also called "rational by participation," because it "obeys the reason" (Ethic. i, 13). Others give the name of passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the cogitative power, which is called the "particular reason." And in each case "passive" may be taken in the two first senses; forasmuch as this so-called <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the act of a corporeal organ. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to things intelligible, and which for this reason <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> calls the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (De Anima iii, 4) is not passive except in the third sense: for it is not an act of a corporeal organ. Hence it is incorruptible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The agent is nobler than the patient, if the action and the passion are referred to the same thing: but not always, if they refer to different things. Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a passive power in regard to the whole universal being: while the vegetative power is active in regard to some particular thing, namely, the body as united to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Wherefore nothing prevents such a passive force being nobler than such an active one.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there is an active intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For as the senses are to things sensible, so is our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to things intelligible. But because sense is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to things sensible, the sense is not said to be active, but only passive. Therefore, since our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to things intelligible, it seems that we cannot say that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is active, but only that it is passive.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if we say that also in the senses there is something active, such as light: on the contrary, light is required for sight, inasmuch as it makes the medium to be actually luminous; for color of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> moves the luminous medium. But in the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> there is no appointed medium that has to be brought into act. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for an active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the likeness of the agent is received into the patient according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the patient. But the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is an immaterial power. Therefore its immaterial <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> suffices for forms to be received into it immaterially. Now a form is intelligible in act from the very fact that it is immaterial. Therefore there is no need for an active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to make the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> actually intelligible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 5), "As in every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is there something by which it becomes all things, and something by which it makes all things." Therefore we must admit an active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, there is no need for an active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in order to make things actually intelligible; but perhaps in order to provide <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as will be explained farther on (4). For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> supposed that the forms of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things subsisted apart from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and consequently that they are intelligible: since a thing is actually intelligible from the very fact that it is immaterial. And he called such forms "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>"; from a participation of which, he said that even corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was formed, in order that <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> might be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> established in their proper genera and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: and that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> was formed by such participation in order to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the genera and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things. But since <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> did not allow that forms of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> apart from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and as forms <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are not actually intelligible; it follows that the natures of forms of the sensible things which we understand are not actually intelligible. Now nothing is reduced from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act except by something in act; as the senses as made actual by what is actually sensible. We must therefore assign on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> some power to make things actually intelligible, by abstraction of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from material <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. And such is the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for an active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sensible things are found in act outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and hence there is no need for an active sense. Wherefore it is clear that in the nutritive part all the powers are active, whereas in the sensitive part all are passive: but in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part, there is something active and something passive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There are two opinions as to the effect of light. For some say that light is required for sight, in order to make colors actually visible. And according to this the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is required for understanding, in like manner and for the same reason as light is required for seeing. But in the opinion of others, light is required for sight; not for the colors to become actually visible; but in order that the medium may become actually luminous, as the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> says on De Anima ii. And according to this, <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> comparison of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to light is verified in this, that as it is required for understanding, so is light required for seeing; but not for the same reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the agent pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, it may well happen that its likeness is received variously into various things, on account of their dispositions. But if the agent does not pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, the disposition of the recipient has nothing to do with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now the intelligible in act is not something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; if we consider the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things sensible, which do not subsist apart from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. And therefore in order to understand them, the immaterial <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> would not suffice but for the presence of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which makes things actually intelligible by way of <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the active intellect is something in the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not something in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the effect of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is to give light for the purpose of understanding. But this is done by something higher than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John 1:9</a>, "He was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light that enlighteneth every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> coming into this world." Therefore the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not something in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, 5) says of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, "that it does not sometimes understand and sometimes not understand." But our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not always understand: sometimes it understands, sometimes it does not understand. Therefore the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not something in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, agent and patient suffice for action. If, therefore, the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is a passive power, is something belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and also the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is an active power: it follows that a man would always be able to understand when he wished, which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not something in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, 5) says that the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a "<a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in actual being." But nothing can be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and in act with regard to the same thing. If, therefore, the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to all things intelligible, is something in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it seems impossible for the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to be also something in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is something in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it must be a power. For it is neither a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> nor a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; since <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are not in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of agents in regard to the passivity of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but rather passion is the very action of the passive power; while <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is something which results from acts. But every power flows from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. It would therefore follow that the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> flows from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And thus it would not be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by way of participation from some higher <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: which is unfitting. Therefore the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not something in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 5), that "it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for these differences," namely, the passive and active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, "to be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks, is something in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In order to make this evident, we must observe that above the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> we must needs suppose a superior <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, from which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> acquires the power of understanding. For what is such by participation, and what is mobile, and what is imperfect always requires the pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> such, immovable and perfect. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is called <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> by reason of a participation in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power; a sign of which is that it is not wholly <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> but only in part. Moreover it reaches to the understanding of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by arguing, with a certain amount of reasoning and movement. Again it has an imperfect understanding; both because it does not understand everything, and because, in those things which it does understand, it passes from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act. Therefore there must needs be some higher <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is helped to understand.

<p>Wherefore some held that this <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, substantially separate, is the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which by lighting up the phantasms as it were, makes them to be actually intelligible. But, even supposing the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of such a separate active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it would still be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to assign to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> some power participating in that superior <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by which power the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> makes things actually intelligible. Just as in other perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, besides the universal active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, each one is endowed with its proper powers derived from those universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: for the sun alone does not generate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; but in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the power of begetting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and in like manner with other perfect animals. Now among these lower things nothing is more perfect than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Wherefore we must say that in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is some power derived from a higher <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whereby it is able to light up the phantasms. And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this by experience, since we perceive that we abstract universal forms from their particular <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, which is to make them actually intelligible. Now no action belongs to anything except through some principle formally inherent therein; as we have said above of the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (76, 1). Therefore the power which is the principle of this action must be something in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For this reason <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Anima iii, 5) compared the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to light, which is something received into the air: while <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> compared the separate <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> impressing the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the sun, as Themistius says in his commentary on De Anima iii. But the separate <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, according to the teaching of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, Who is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> Creator, and only beatitude; as will be shown later on (90, 3; I-II, 3, 7). Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> derives its <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light from Him, according to <a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse7">Psalm 4:7</a>, "The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light enlightens as a universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, from which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> derives a particular power, as we have explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says those words not of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act: of which he had already said: "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> in act is the same as the thing." Or, if we refer those words to the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, then they are said because it is not owing to the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> that sometimes we do, and sometimes we do not understand, but to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the relation of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the passive were that of the active object to a power, as, for instance, of the visible in act to the sight; it would follow that we could understand all things instantly, since the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is that which makes all things (in act). But now the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not an object, rather is it that whereby the objects are made to be in act: for which, besides the presence of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, we require the presence of phantasms, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition of the sensitive powers, and practice in this sort of operation; since through one thing understood, other things come to be understood, as from terms are made propositions, and from first principles, conclusions. From this point of view it matters not whether the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is something belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or something separate from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is indeed actually immaterial, but it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> phantasms are actual images of certain <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but are immaterial in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Wherefore nothing prevents one and the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, inasmuch as it is actually immaterial, having one power by which it makes things actually immaterial, by abstraction from the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: which power is called the "active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>"; and another power, receptive of such <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which is called the "passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>" by reason of its being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to such <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is immaterial, <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by the supreme <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, nothing prevents that power which it derives from the supreme <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and whereby it abstracts from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, flowing from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in the same way as its other powers.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the active intellect is one in all?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is one active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in all. For what is separate from the body is not multiplied according to the number of bodies. But the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is "separate," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 5). Therefore it is not multiplied in the many <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies, but is one for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the universal, which is one in many. But that which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of unity is still more itself one. Therefore the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the same in all.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> agree in the first <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> concepts. But to these they assent by the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore all agree in one active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 5) that the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is as a light. But light is not the same in the various things enlightened. Therefore the same active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not in various men.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about this question depends on what we have already said (4). For if the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were not something belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but were some separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, there would be one active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And this is what they mean who hold that there is one active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> for all. But if the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is something belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as one of its powers, we are bound to say that there are as many active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> as there are <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which are multiplied according to the number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as we have said above (Question 76, Article 2). For it is impossible that one same power belong to various <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves that the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is separate, by the fact that the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is separate: because, as he says (De Anima iii, 5), "the agent is more noble than the patient." Now the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is said to be separate, because it is not the act of any corporeal organ. And in the same sense the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is also called "separate"; but not as a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the universal, by abstracting it from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But for this purpose it need not be the same <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in all <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> beings; but it must be one in its relationship to all those things from which it abstracts the universal, with respect to which things the universal is one. And this befits the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> inasmuch as it is immaterial.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All things which are of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> enjoy in common the action which accompanies the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and consequently the power which is the principle of such action; but not so as that power be identical in all. Now to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the first intelligible principles is the action belonging to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Wherefore all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> enjoy in common the power which is the principle of this action: and this power is the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But there is no need for it to be identical in all. Yet it must be derived by all from one principle. And thus the possession by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in common of the first principles proves the unity of the separate <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> compares to the sun; but not the unity of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> compares to light.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether memory is in the intellectual part of the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 2,3,8) that to the higher part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> belongs those things which are not "common to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and beast." But <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is common to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and beast, for he says (De Trin. xii, 2,3,8) that "beasts can sense corporeal things through the senses of the body, and commit them to <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is of the past. But the past is said of something with regard to a fixed time. <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">Memory</a>, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a thing under a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of a fixed time; which involves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> under the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of "here" and "now." But this is not the province of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but of the sense. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part, but only in the sensitive.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> are preserved the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of those things of which we are not actually thinking. But this cannot happen in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is reduced to act by the fact that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are received into it. Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act implies understanding in act; and therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> actually understands all things of which it has the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 11) that "<a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, understanding, and will are one mind."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since it is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> to preserve the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of those things which are not actually apprehended, we must first of all consider whether the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> can thus be preserved in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: because <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> held that this was impossible. For he admitted that this could happen in the sensitive part, as to some powers, inasmuch as they are acts of corporeal organs, in which certain <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> may be preserved apart from actual apprehension. But in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which has no corporeal organ, nothing but what is intelligible <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. Wherefore every thing of which the likeness <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> must be actually understood. Thus, therefore, according to him, as soon as we cease to understand something actually, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that thing ceases to be in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and if we wish to understand that thing anew, we must turn to the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which he held to be a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, in order that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> may thence flow again into our passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And from the practice and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of turning to the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> there is formed, according to him, a certain aptitude in the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> for turning to the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; which aptitude he calls the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. According, therefore, to this supposition, nothing is preserved in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part that is not actually understood: wherefore it would not be possible to admit <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part.

<p>But this opinion is clearly opposed to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. For he says (De Anima iii, 4) that, when the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> "is identified with each thing as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it, it is said to be in act," and that "this happens when it can operate of itself. And, even then, it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, but not in the same way as before learning and discovering." Now, the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is said to be each thing, inasmuch as it receives the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of each thing. To the fact, therefore, that it receives the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of intelligible things it owes its being able to operate when it wills, but not so that it be always operating: for even then is it in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in a certain sense, though otherwise than before the act of understanding--namely, in the sense that whoever has <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to actual consideration.

<p>The foregoing opinion is also opposed to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. For what is received into something is received according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of the recipient. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is of a more stable <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and is more immovable than corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. If, therefore, corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> holds the forms which it receives, not only while it actually does something through them, but also after ceasing to act through them, much more cogent reason is there for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to receive the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> unchangeably and lastingly, whether it receive them from things sensible, or derive them from some superior <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Thus, therefore, if we take <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> only for the power of retaining <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, we must say that it is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part. But if in the notion of <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> we include its object as something past, then the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, but only in the sensitive part, which apprehends <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> things. For past, as past, since it signifies being under a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of fixed time, is something <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">Memory</a>, if considered as retentive of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is not common to us and other animals. For <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are not retained in the sensitive part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> only, but rather in the body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united: since the memorative power is the act of some organ. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in itself is retentive of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, without the association of any corporeal organ. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 4) that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the seat of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, not the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of past may be referred to two things--namely, to the object which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and to the act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. These two are found together in the sensitive part, which apprehends something from the fact of its being immuted by a present sensible: wherefore at the same time an animal remembers to have sensed before in the past, and to have sensed some past sensible thing. But as concerns the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part, the past is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, and is not in itself a part of the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> that he <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the present, past, or future. But on the part of the act, the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of past, even as such, may be understood to be in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as well as in the senses. Because our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> act of understanding is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> act, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in this or that time, inasmuch as a man is said to understand now, or yesterday, or tomorrow. And this is not incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: for such an act of understanding, though something <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, is yet an immaterial act, as we have said above of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (76, 1); and therefore, as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands itself, though it be itself an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, so also it understands its act of understanding, which is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> act, in the past, present, or future. In this way, then, the notion of <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, in as far as it regards past events, is preserved in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, forasmuch as it understands that it previously understood: but not in the sense that it understands the past as something "here" and "now."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is sometimes in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> only in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, and then the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is said to be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Sometimes the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as regards the ultimate completion of the act, and then it understands in act. And sometimes the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is in a middle state, between <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and act: and then we have <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. In this way the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> retains the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, even when it does not understand in act.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the intellectual memory is a power distinct from the intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. x, 11) assigns to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, understanding, and will. But it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is a distinct power from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore it is also distinct from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the reason of distinction among the powers in the sensitive part is the same as in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part. But <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> in the sensitive part is distinct from sense, as we have said (78, 4). Therefore <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. x, 11; xi, 7), <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, understanding, and will are equal to one another, and one flows from the other. But this could not be if <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were the same power. Therefore they are not the same power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> From its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is the treasury or storehouse of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii) attributes this to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as we have said (6, ad 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is not another power from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As has been said above (Question 77, Article 3), the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are distinguished by the different formal aspects of their objects: since each power is defined in reference to that thing to which it is directed and which is its object. It has also been said above (Question 59, Article 4) that if any power by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be directed to an object according to the common ratio of the object, that power will not be differentiated according to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> differences of that object: just as the power of sight, which regards its object under the common ratio of color, is not differentiated by differences of black and white. Now, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> regards its object under the common ratio of being: since the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is that "in which all are in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>." Wherefore the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not differentiated by any difference of being. Nevertheless there is a distinction between the power of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and of the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: because as regards the same object, the active power which makes the object to be in act must be distinct from the passive power, which is moved by the object <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in act. Thus the active power is compared to its object as a being in act is to a being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; whereas the passive power, on the contrary, is compared to its object as being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is to a being in act. Therefore there can be no other difference of powers in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but that of passive and active. Wherefore it is clear that <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is not a distinct power from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: for it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a passive power to retain as well as to receive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although it is said (3 Sent. D, 1) that <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and will are three powers, this is not in accordance with the meaning of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, who says expressly (De Trin. xiv) that "if we take <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, and will as always present in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whether we actually attend to them or not, they seem to pertain to the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> only. And by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> I mean that by which we understand when actually thinking; and by will I mean that love or affection which unites the child and its parent." Wherefore it is clear that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> does not take the above three for three powers; but by <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> he understands the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of retention; by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and by will, the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Past and present may differentiate the sensitive powers, but not the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> powers, for the reason give above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Intelligence arises from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, as act from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; and in this way it is equal to it, but not as a power to a power.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the reason is distinct from the intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the reason is a distinct power from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For it is stated in De Spiritu et Anima that "when we wish to rise from lower things to higher, first the sense comes to our aid, then <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, then reason, then the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>." Therefore the reason is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is from sense.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iv, 6), that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is compared to reason, as <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> to time. But it does not belong to the same power to be in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and to be in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Therefore reason and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are not the same power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in common with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and sense in common with the brutes. But reason, which is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whence he is called a rational animal, is a power distinct from sense. Therefore is it equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that it is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which properly belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: whence they are called <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. iii, 20) that "that in which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> excels irrational animals is reason, or mind, or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> or whatever appropriate name we like to give it." Therefore, reason, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and mind are one power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be distinct powers. We shall understand this clearly if we consider their respective actions. For to understand is simply to apprehend intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: and to reason is to advance from one thing understood to another, so as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> an intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who according to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, possess perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, have no need to advance from one thing to another; but apprehend the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> simply and without <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> discussion, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii). But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> arrives at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by advancing from one thing to another; and therefore he is called rational. Reasoning, therefore, is compared to understanding, as movement is to rest, or acquisition to possession; of which one belongs to the perfect, the other to the imperfect. And since movement always proceeds from something immovable, and ends in something at rest; hence it is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasoning, by way of inquiry and discovery, advances from certain things simply understood--namely, the first principles; and, again, by way of judgment returns by analysis to first principles, in the light of which it examines what it has found. Now it is clear that rest and movement are not to be referred to different powers, but to one and the same, even in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things: since by the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> a thing is moved towards a certain place. Much more, therefore, by the same power do we understand and reason: and so it is clear that in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> reason and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are the same power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That enumeration is made according to the order of actions, not according to the distinction of powers. Moreover, that book is not of great authority.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The answer is clear from what we have said. For <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is compared to time as immovable to movable. And thus <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> compared the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and reason to time.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Other animals are so much lower than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that they cannot attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which reason seeks. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attains, although imperfectly, to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> the power of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not of a different genus fro that which is in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but is compared to it as the perfect to the imperfect.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether the higher and lower reason are distinct powers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the higher and lower reason are distinct powers. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 4,7), that the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is in the higher part of the reason, and not in the lower. But the parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are its powers. Therefore the higher and lower reason are two powers.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing flows from itself. Now, the lower reason flows from the higher, and is ruled and directed by it. Therefore the higher reason is another power from the lower.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 1) that "the scientific part" of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things, is another principle, and another part from the "opinionative" and "reasoning" part by which it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> contingent things. And he proves this from the principle that for those things which are "generically different, generically different parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are ordained." Now contingent and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> are generically different, as corruptible and incorruptible. Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> is the same as <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and temporal the same as <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>, it seems that what the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> calls the "scientific" part must be the same as the higher reason, which, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xii, 7) "is intent on the consideration and consultation of things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>"; and that what the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> calls the "reasoning" or "opinionative" part is the same as the lower reason, which, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, "is intent on the disposal of temporal things." Therefore the higher reason is another power than the lower.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii) that "opinion rises from the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>: then the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> by judging of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the opinion discovers the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: whence" men's (mind) "is derived from" metiendo [measuring]. "And therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> regards those things which are already subject to judgment and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> decision." Therefore the opinionative power, which is the lower reason, is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by which we may understand the higher reason.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 4) that "the higher and lower reason are only distinct by their functions." Therefore they are not two powers.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The higher and lower reason, as they are understood by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, can in no way be two powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For he says that "the higher reason is that which is intent on the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and consultation of things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>": forasmuch as in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> it sees them in themselves, and in consultation it takes its rules of action from them. But he calls the lower reason that which "is intent on the disposal of temporal things." Now these two--namely, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and temporal --are related to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in this way, that one of them is the means of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the other. For by way of discovery, we come through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of temporal things to that of things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, according to the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>), "The invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made": while by way of judgment, from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, we judge of temporal things, and according to laws of things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> we dispose of temporal things.

<p>But it may happen that the medium and what is attained thereby belong to different <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>: as the first indemonstrable principles belong to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; whereas the conclusions which we draw from them belong to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of science. And so it happens that from the principles of geometry we draw a conclusion in another science--for example, perspective. But the power of the reason is such that both medium and term belong to it. For the act of the reason is, as it were, a movement from one thing to another. But the same movable thing passes through the medium and reaches the end. Wherefore the higher and lower reasons are one and the same power. But according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> they are distinguished by the functions of their actions, and according to their various <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>: for wisdom is attributed to the higher reason, science to the lower.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We speak of parts, in whatever way a thing is divided. And so far as reason is divided according to its various acts, the higher and lower reason are called parts; but not because they are different powers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The lower reason is said to flow from the higher, or to be ruled by it, as far as the principles made use of by the lower reason are drawn from and directed by the principles of the higher reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The "scientific" part, of which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks, is not the same as the higher reason: for <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> are found even among temporal things, of which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> science and mathematics treat. And the "opinionative" and "ratiocinative" part is more limited than the lower reason; for it regards only things contingent. Neither must we say, without any qualification, that a power, by which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things, is distinct from a power by which it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> contingent things: because it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> both under the same objective aspect--namely, under the aspect of being and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Wherefore it perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things which have perfect being in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; since it penetrates to their very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, from which it demonstrates their proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. On the other hand, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> contingent things, but imperfectly; forasmuch as they have but imperfect being and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now perfect and imperfect in the action do not vary the power, but they vary the actions as to the mode of acting, and consequently the principles of the actions and the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> themselves. And therefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> postulates two lesser parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--namely, the "scientific" and the "ratiocinative," not because they are two powers, but because they are distinct according to a different aptitude for receiving various <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, concerning the variety of which he inquires. For contingent and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, though differing according to their proper genera, nevertheless agree in the common aspect of being, which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> considers, and to which they are variously compared as perfect and imperfect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> That distinction given by <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> is according to the variety of acts, not according to the variety of powers. For "opinion" signifies an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which leans to one side of a contradiction, whilst in fear of the other. While to "judge" or "measure" [mensurare] is an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, applying certain principles to examine propositions. From this is taken the word "mens" [mind]. Lastly, to "understand" is to adhere to the formed judgment with approval.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether intelligence is a power distinct from intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is another power than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For we read in De Spiritu et Anima that "when we wish to rise from lower to higher things, first the sense comes to our aid, then <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, then reason, then <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and afterwards <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>." But <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and sense are distinct powers. Therefore also <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> are distinct.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. v, 4) that "sense considers <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in one way, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> in another, reason in another, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> in another." But <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the same power as reason. Therefore, seemingly, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is a distinct power from <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as reason is a distinct power from <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> or sense.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "actions came before powers," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 4). But <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is an act separate from others attributed to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii) that "the first movement is called <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>; but that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> which is about a certain thing is called <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>; that which remains and conforms the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to that which is understood is called invention, and invention when it remains in the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, examining and judging of itself, is called phronesis [that is, wisdom], and phronesis if dilated makes thought, that is, orderly internal speech; from which, they say, comes speech expressed by the tongue." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is some special power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 6) that "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is of indivisible things in which there is nothing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these things belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is not another power than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This word "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>" properly signifies the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect's</a> very act, which is to understand. However, in some works translated from the Arabic, the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> which we call <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are called "intelligences," and perhaps for this reason, that such <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are always actually understanding. But in works translated from the Greek, they are called "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>" or "minds." Thus <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is not distinct from <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as power is from power; but as act is from power. And such a division is recognized even by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. For sometimes they assign four <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>--namely, the "active" and "passive" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> "in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>," and the "actual" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Of which four the active and passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> are different powers; just as in all things the active power is distinct from the passive. But three of these are distinct, as three states of the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is sometimes in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> only, and thus it is called passive; sometimes it is in the first act, which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and thus it is called <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; and sometimes it is in the second act, which is to consider, and thus it is called <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act, or actual <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If this authority is accepted, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> there means the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And thus it is divided against <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as act against power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> takes <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> as meaning that act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which transcends the act of the reason. Wherefore he also says that reason alone belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> alone belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to understand all things without any investigation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All those acts which <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> enumerates belong to one power--namely, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power. For this power first of all only apprehends something; and this act is called "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>."

<p>Secondly, it directs what it apprehends to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of something else, or to some operation; and this is called "<a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>." And when it goes on in search of what it "intends," it is called "invention." When, by reference to something <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> for certain, it examines what it has found, it is said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or to be wise, which belongs to "phronesis" or "wisdom"; for "it belongs to the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to judge," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. i, 2). And when once it has obtained something for certain, as being fully examined, it thinks about the means of making it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to others; and this is the ordering of "interior speech," from which proceeds "external speech." For every difference of acts does not make the powers vary, but only what cannot be reduced to the one same principle, as we have said above (Question 78, Article 4).

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether the speculative and practical intellects are distinct powers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the speculative and practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> are distinct powers. For the apprehensive and motive are different kinds of powers, as is clear from De Anima ii, 3. But the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is merely an apprehensive power; while the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a motive power. Therefore they are distinct powers.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the different <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the object differentiates the power. But the object of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," and of the practical is "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>"; which differ in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore the speculative and practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are distinct powers.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part, the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is compared to the speculative, as the estimative is to the imaginative power in the sensitive part. But the estimative differs from the imaginative, as power form power, as we have said above (Question 78, Article 4). Therefore also the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> differs from the practical.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by extension becomes practical (De Anima iii, 10). But one power is not changed into another. Therefore the speculative and practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> are not distinct powers.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The speculative and practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> are not distinct powers. The reason of which is that, as we have said above (Question 77, Article 3), what is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the object of a power, does not differentiate that power; for it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to a thing colored to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or to be great or small; hence all such things are apprehended by the same power of sight. Now, to a thing apprehended by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> whether it be directed to operation or not, and according to this the speculative and practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> differ. For it is the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which directs what it apprehends, not to operation, but to the consideration of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; while the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is that which directs what it apprehends to operation. And this is what the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 10); that "the speculative differs from the practical in its end." Whence each is named from its end: the one speculative, the other practical--i.e. operative.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a motive power, not as executing movement, but as directing towards it; and this belongs to it according to its mode of apprehension.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Truth and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> include one another; for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, otherwise it would not be desirable; and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is something <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, otherwise it would not be intelligible. Therefore as the object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> may be something <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as having the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for example, when some one desires to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; so the object of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> directed to the operation, and under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, just as the speculative, but it directs the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to operation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Many differences differentiate the sensitive powers, which do not differentiate the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> powers, as we have said above (7, ad 2; 77, 3, ad 4).

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether synderesis is a special power of the soul distinct from the others?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> is a special power, distinct from the others. For those things which fall under one division, seem to be of the same genus. But in the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> on <a href="../bible/eze001.htm#verse6">Ezekiel 1:6</a>, <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> is divided against the irascible, the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, and the rational, which are powers. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> is a power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, opposite things are of the same genus. But <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> and sensuality seem to be opposed to one another because <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> always incites to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; while sensuality always incites to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: whence it is signified by the serpent, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xii, 12,13). It seems, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> is a power just as sensuality is.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 10) that in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of judgment there are certain "rules and seeds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, both <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and unchangeable." And this is what we call <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">synderesis</a>. Since, therefore, the unchangeable rules which guide our judgment belong to the reason as to its higher part, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 2), it seems that <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> is the same as reason: and thus it is a power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. viii, 2), "rational powers regard opposite things." But <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> does not regard opposites, but inclines to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> only. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> is not a power. For if it were a power it would be a rational power, since it is not found in brute animals.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> "Synderesis" is not a power but a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; though some held that it is a power higher than reason; while others [Cf. <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, Sum. Theol. II, 73] said that it is reason itself, not as reason, but as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. In order to make this clear we must observe that, as we have said above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> act of reasoning, since it is a kind of movement, proceeds from the understanding of certain things--namely, those which are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> without any investigation on the part of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as from an immovable principle--and ends also at the understanding, inasmuch as by means of those principles <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, we judge of those things which we have discovered by reasoning. Now it is clear that, as the speculative reason argues about speculative things, so that practical reason argues about practical things. Therefore we must have, bestowed on us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not only speculative principles, but also practical principles. Now the first speculative principles bestowed on us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> do not belong to a special power, but to a special <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, which is called "the understanding of principles," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> explains (Ethic. vi, 6). Wherefore the first practical principles, bestowed on us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, do not belong to a special power, but to a special <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, which we call <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a>. Whence <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> is said to incite to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and to murmur at <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, inasmuch as through first principles we proceed to discover, and judge of what we have discovered. It is therefore clear that <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> is not a power, but a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The division given by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> is taken from the variety of acts, and not from the variety of powers; and various acts can belong to one power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In like manner, the opposition of sensuality to "syneresis" is an opposition of acts, and not of the different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of one genus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those unchangeable notions are the first practical principles, concerning which no one <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>; and they are attributed to reason as to a power, and to <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> as to a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Wherefore we judge <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> both by our reason and by <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a>.

<h2 id="article13">Article 13. Whether conscience be a power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is a power; for <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says [Commentary on Romans 2:15] that "<a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is a correcting and guiding spirit accompanying the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by which it is led away from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and made to cling to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, spirit designates a power--either the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> itself, according to the text (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians 4:13</a>), "Be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind"--or the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, whence <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision is called <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 7,24). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is a power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing is a subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is a subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for it is said of some that "their mind and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> are defiled" (<a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse15">Titus 1:15</a>). Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is a power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be either an act, a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, or a power. But it is not an act; for thus it would not always <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Nor is it a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; for <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is not one thing but many, since we are directed in our actions by many <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is a power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Conscience can be laid aside. But a power cannot be laid aside. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is not a power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is not a power, but an act. This is evident both from the very name and from those things which in the common way of speaking are attributed to <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. For <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, according to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the word, implies the relation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to something: for <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> may be resolved into "cum alio scientia," i.e. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> applied to an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> case. But the application of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to something is done by some act. Wherefore from this explanation of the name it is clear that <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is an act.

<p>The same is manifest from those things which are attributed to <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. For <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is said to witness, to bind, or incite, and also to accuse, torment, or rebuke. And all these follow the application of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or science to what we do: which application is made in three ways. One way in so far as we recognize that we have done or not done something; "Thy <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> that thou hast often spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of others" (<a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse23">Ecclesiastes 7:23</a>), and according to this, <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is said to witness. In another way, so far as through the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> we judge that something should be done or not done; and in this sense, <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is said to incite or to bind. In the third way, so far as by <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> we judge that something done is well done or ill done, and in this sense <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is said to excuse, accuse, or torment. Now, it is clear that all these things follow the actual application of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to what we do. Wherefore, properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> denominates an act. But since <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a principle of act, sometimes the name <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is given to the first <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>--namely, <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a>: thus <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> calls <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> (Gloss. <a href="../bible/eze001.htm#verse6">Ezekiel 1:6</a>); <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> [Hom. in princ. Proverb.], the "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of judgment," and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> [De Fide Orth. iv. 22 says that it is the "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>." For it is customary for <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> and effects to be called after one another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Conscience is called a spirit, so far as spirit is the same as mind; because <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is a certain pronouncement of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is said to be defiled, not as a subject, but as the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; so far as someone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> he is defiled.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although an act does not always remain in itself, yet it always remains in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is power and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now all the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> by which <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is formed, although many, nevertheless have their efficacy from one first <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of first principles, which is called <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a>. And for this special reason, this <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is sometimes called <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, as we have said above.
