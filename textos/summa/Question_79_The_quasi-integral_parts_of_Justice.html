<h1>Question 79. The quasi-integral parts of Justice</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether to decline from evil and to do good are parts of justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that to decline from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are not parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For it belongs to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to perform a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> and to avoid an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one. But parts do not exceed the whole. Therefore to decline from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> should not be reckoned parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is a special kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa033.htm#verse15">Psalm 33:15</a>, "Turn away from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," says: "The former," i.e. to turn away from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, "avoids <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the latter," i.e. to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, "deserves the life and the palm." But any part of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> deserves the life and the palm. Therefore to decline from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things that are so related that one implies the other, are not mutually distinct as parts of a whole. Now declining from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is implied in doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: since no one does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> at the same time. Therefore declining from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are not parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Correp. et Grat. i) declares that "declining from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" belong to the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we speak of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in general, it belongs to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and in this sense they cannot be reckoned parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, except <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be taken in the sense of "all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" [Cf. 58, 5]. And yet even if <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be taken in this sense it regards a certain special aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; namely, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as due in respect of Divine or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p>On the other hand <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> considered as a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as due to one's neighbor. And in this sense it belongs to special <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> considered as due to one's neighbor, and to avoid the opposite <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that, namely, which is hurtful to one's neighbor; while it belongs to general <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in relation to the community or in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to avoid the opposite <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p>Now these two are said to be quasi-integral parts of general or of special <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, because each is required for the perfect act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to establish equality in our relations with others, as shown above (Question 58, Article 2): and it pertains to the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to establish and to preserve that which it has established. Now a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> establishes the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, i.e. by rendering to another his due: and he preserves the already established equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by declining from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that is by inflicting no injury on his neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are here considered under a special aspect, by which they are appropriated to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The reason why these two are reckoned parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> under a special aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, while they are not reckoned parts of any other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is that the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are concerned with the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> wherein to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to observe the mean, which is the same as to avoid the extremes as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: so that doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and avoiding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> come to the same, with regard to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is concerned with operations and external things, wherein to establish equality is one thing, and not to disturb the equality established is another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To decline from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, considered as a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, does not denote a pure negation, viz."not to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>"; for this does not deserve the palm, but only avoids the punishment. But it implies a movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in repudiating <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as the very term "decline" shows. This is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>; especially when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> resists against an instigation to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the completive act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and the principal part, so to speak, thereof. Declining from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a more imperfect act, and a secondary part of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence it is a. material part, so to speak, thereof, and a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the formal and completive part.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether transgression is a special sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that transgression is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is included in the definition of its genus. Now transgression is included in the definition of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; because <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Parad. viii) that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is "a transgression of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>." Therefore transgression is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is more comprehensive than its genus. But transgression is more comprehensive than <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a "word, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> or desire against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Faust. xxii, 27), while transgression is also against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or custom. Therefore transgression is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> contains all the parts into which its genus is divided. Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of transgression extends to all the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, as well as to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of thought, word and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Therefore transgression is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is opposed to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The term transgression is derived from bodily movement and applied to moral actions. Now a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to transgress in bodily movement, when he steps [graditur] beyond [trans] a fixed boundary--and it is a negative precept that fixes the boundary that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> must not exceed in his moral actions. Wherefore to transgress, properly speaking, is to act against a negative precept.

<p>Now materially considered this may be common to all the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> transgresses a Divine precept by any <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>But if we consider it formally, namely under its special aspect of an act against a negative precept, it is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in two ways. First, in so far as it is opposed to those kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that are opposed to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for just as it belongs properly to legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to consider a precept as binding, so it belongs properly to a transgression to consider a precept as an object of contempt. Secondly, in so far as it is distinct from omission which is opposed to an affirmative precept.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even as legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is "all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" (58, 5) as regards its subject and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so legal <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is materially "all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." It is in this way that <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> defined <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, considering it from the point of view of legal <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination concerns the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. Again, a laudable custom has the force of a precept; since as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in an epistle On the Fast of the Sabbath (Ep. xxxvi), "a custom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people should be looked upon as <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." Hence both <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and transgression may be against a laudable custom and against a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may include transgression, if we consider them not under their proper aspects, but under a special aspect, as stated above. The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, however, is altogether distinct from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of transgression.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether omission is a special sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that omission is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is either original or actual. Now omission is not <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, for it is not contracted through origin nor is it actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for it may be altogether without act, as stated above (I-II, 71, 5) when we were treating of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in general. Therefore omission is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Now omission sometimes is not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> but <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as when a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is violated after taking a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, or when one lose that which one is under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to restore, or when a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is bound to say Mass, and is prevented from doing so. Therefore omission is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is possible to fix the time when any special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> begins. But this is not possible in the case of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, since one is not altered by not doing a thing, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> when the omission occurs, and yet the omission is not always <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Therefore omission is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, every special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But it is not possible to assign any special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to which omission is opposed, both because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be omitted, and because <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to which it would seem more particularly opposed, always requires an act, even in declining from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated above (1, ad 2), while omission may be altogether without act. Therefore omission is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse17">James 4:17</a>): "To him . . . who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and doth it not, to him it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> omission signifies the non-fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not indeed of any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is due. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> under the aspect of due belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; to legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, if the thing due depends on Divine or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; to special <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, if the due is something in relation to one's neighbor. Wherefore, in the same way as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (58, 6,7), omission is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> distinct from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are opposed to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and just as doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the opposite of omitting it, is a special part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, distinct from avoiding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, to which transgression is opposed, so too is omission distinct from transgression.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Omission is not original but actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not as though it had some act <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to it, but for as much as the negation of an act is reduced to the genus of act, and in this sense non-action is a kind of action, as stated above (I-II, 71, 6, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Omission, as stated above, is only of such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as is due and to which one is bound. Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to the impossible: wherefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, if he does not do what he cannot. Accordingly she who is violated after vowing <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, is guilty of an <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, not through not having <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, but through not repenting of her past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or through not doing what she can to fulfil her <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> by observing continence. Again a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is not bound to say Mass, except he have a suitable opportunity, and if this be lacking, there is no <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>. And in like manner, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is bound to restitution, supposing he has the wherewithal; if he has not and cannot have it, he is not guilty of an <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, provided he does what he can. The same applies to other similar cases.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of transgression is opposed to negative precepts which regard the avoidance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> is opposed to affirmative precepts, which regard the doing of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now affirmative precepts bind not for always, but for a fixed time, and at that time the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> begins. But it may happen that then one is unable to do what one ought, and if this inability is without any fault on his part, he does not omit his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, as stated above (ad 2; I-II, 71, 5). On the other hand if this inability is due to some previous fault of his (for instance, if a man gets drunk at night, and cannot get up for matins, as he ought to), some say that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> begins when he engages in an action that is illicit and incompatible with the act to which he is bound. But this does not seem to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, for supposing one were to rouse him by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and that he went to matins, he would not omit to go, so that, evidently, the previous drunkenness was not an <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>. Consequently, we must say that the omission begins to be imputed to him as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when the time comes for the action; and yet this is on account of a preceding <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by reason of which the subsequent omission becomes <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Omission is directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above; because it is a non-fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but only under the aspect of due, which pertains to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now more is required for an act to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> than for it to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and demeritorious, because "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> results from an entire <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arises from each single defect" [Dionysius, De Div. Nom. iv]. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> requires an act, whereas an omission does not.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a sin of omission is more grievous than a sin of transgression?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> is more grievous than a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of transgression. For "delictum" would seem to signify the same as "derelictum" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, QQ. in Levit., qu. xx], and therefore is seemingly the same as an <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>. But "delictum" denotes a more grievous offence than transgression, because it deserves more expiation as appears from <a href="../bible/lev005.htm">Leviticus 5</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> is more grievous than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of transgression.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is opposed to the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. viii, 10). Now to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is a more excellent part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, than to decline from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, to which transgression is opposed, as stated above (1, ad 3). Therefore omission is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than transgression.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of transgression may be either venial or mortal.

<p>But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of omission seem to be always mortal, since they are opposed to an affirmative precept. Therefore omission would seem to be a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than transgression.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the pain of loss which consists in being deprived of seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and is inflicted for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, is a greater punishment than the pain of sense, which is inflicted for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of transgression, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> states (Hom. xxiii super Matth.). Now punishment is proportionate to fault. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> is graver than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of transgression.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is easier to refrain from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> than to accomplish <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Therefore it is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not to refrain from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, i.e. "to transgress," than not to accomplish a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, which is "to omit."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> depends on its remoteness from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now contrariety is the greatest remoteness, according to Metaph. x [Didot. ed. ix, 4. Wherefore a thing is further removed from its contrary than from its simple negation; thus black is further removed from white than not-white is, since every black is not-white, but not conversely. Now it is evident that transgression is contrary to an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, while <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> denotes the negation thereof: for instance it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, if one fail to give one's parents due reverence, while it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of transgression to revile them or injure them in any way. Hence it is evident that, simply and absolutely speaking, transgression is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than omission, although a particular omission may be graver than a particular transgression.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "Delictum" in its widest sense denotes any kind of omission; but sometimes it is taken strictly for the omission of something concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or for a man's intentional and as it were contemptuous dereliction of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>: and then it has a certain gravity, for which reason it demands a greater expiation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The opposite of "doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" is both "not doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," which is an <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, and "doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," which is a transgression: but the first is opposed by contradiction, the second by contrariety, which implies greater remoteness: wherefore transgression is the more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as omission is opposed to affirmative precepts, so is transgression opposed to negative precepts: wherefore both, strictly speaking, have the character of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Transgression and <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, however, may be taken broadly for any infringement of an affirmative or negative precept, disposing to the opposite of such precept: and so taking both in a broad sense they may be venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> To the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of transgression there correspond both the pain of loss on account of the aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the pain of sense, on account of the inordinate conversion to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. On like manner omission deserves not only the pain of loss, but also the pain of sense, according to <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse19">Matthew 7:19</a>, "Every tree that bringeth not forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fruit shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire"; and this on account of the root from which it grows, although it does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> imply conversion to any mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.
