<h1>Question 7. The circumstances of human acts</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2007.htm#article1"> What is a circumstance?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2007.htm#article2"> Should a theologian take note of the circumstances of human acts?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2007.htm#article3"> How many circumstances are there?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2007.htm#article4"> Which are the most important of them?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a circumstance is an accident of a human act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a circumstance is not an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> of a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>. For Tully says (De Invent. Rhetor. i) that a circumstance is that from "which an orator adds authority and strength to his argument." But oratorical arguments are derived principally from things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing, such as the definition, the genus, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and the like, from which also Tully declares that an orator should draw his arguments. Therefore a circumstance is not an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> of a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "to be in" is proper to an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. But that which surrounds [circumstat] is rather out than in. Therefore the circumstances are not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> has no <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> themselves are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. Therefore the circumstances are not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of acts.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The particular <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of any singular thing are called its individuating <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 1) calls the circumstances particular things [<em>ta kath' ekasta</em>], i.e. the particular <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of each act. Therefore the circumstances are <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Peri Herm. i), "words are the signs of what we understand," it must needs be that in naming things we follow the process of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> proceeds from the better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the less <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Accordingly with us, names of more obvious things are transferred so as to signify things less obvious: and hence it is that, as stated in Metaph. x, 4, "the notion of distance has been transferred from things that are apart locally, to all kinds of opposition": and in like manner words that signify local movement are employed to designate all other movements, because bodies which are circumscribed by place, are best <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us. And hence it is that the word "circumstance" has passed from located things to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>.

<p>Now in things located, that is said to surround something, which is outside it, but touches it, or is placed near it. Accordingly, whatever <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are outside the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of an act, and yet in some way touch the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>, are called circumstances. Now what is outside a thing's <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, while it belongs to that thing, is called its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Wherefore the circumstances of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> should be called their <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The orator gives strength to his argument, in the first place, from the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act; and secondly, from the circumstances of the act. Thus a man becomes indictable, first, through being guilty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>; secondly, through having done it <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulently</a>, or from motives of greed or at a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> time or place, and so forth. And so in the passage quoted, it is said pointedly that the orator "adds strength to his argument," as though this were something secondary.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A thing is said to be an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> of something in two ways. First, from being in that thing: thus, whiteness is said to be an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>. Secondly, because it is together with that thing in the same subject: thus, whiteness is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> of the art of music, inasmuch as they meet in the same subject, so as to touch one another, as it were. And in this sense circumstances are said to be the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (ad 2), an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is said to be the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, from the fact that they meet in the same subject. But this happens in two ways. First, in so far as two <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are both related to the same subject, without any relation to one another; as whiteness and the art of music in <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>. Secondly, when such <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are related to one another; as when the subject receives one <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> by means of the other; for instance, a body receives color by means of its surface. And thus also is one <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> said to be in another; for we speak of color as being in the surface.

<p>Accordingly, circumstances are related to acts in both these ways. For some circumstances that have a relation to acts, belong to the agent otherwise than through the act; as place and <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; whereas others belong to the agent by reason of the act, as the manner in which the act is done.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether theologians should take note of the circumstances of human acts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that theologians should not take note of the circumstances of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. Because theologians do not consider <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> otherwise than according to their <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But it seems that circumstances cannot give <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>; for a thing is never qualified, formally speaking, by that which is outside it; but by that which is in it. Therefore theologians should not take note of the circumstances of acts.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, circumstances are the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of acts. But one thing may be subject to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>; hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. vi, 2) that "no art or science considers <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> being, except only the art of sophistry." Therefore the theologian has not to consider circumstances.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the consideration of circumstances belongs to the orator. But oratory is not a part of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Therefore it is not a theologian's business to consider circumstances.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> of circumstances <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an act to be involuntary, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 24) and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxxi.]. But involuntariness excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the consideration of which belongs to the theologian. Therefore circumstances also should be considered by the theologian.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Circumstances come under the consideration of the theologian, for a threefold reason. First, because the theologian considers <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is thereby directed to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">Happiness</a>. Now, everything that is directed to an end should be proportionate to that end. But acts are made proportionate to an end by means of a certain commensurateness, which results from the due circumstances. Hence the theologian has to consider the circumstances. Secondly, because the theologian considers <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> according as they are found to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, better or worse: and this diversity depends on circumstances, as we shall see further on (18, A10,11; 73, 7). Thirdly, because the theologian considers <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and demerit, which is proper to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>; and for this it is requisite that they be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> is deemed to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> or involuntary, according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of circumstances, as stated above (Question 6, Article 8). Therefore the theologian has to consider circumstances.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Good directed to the end is said to be useful; and this implies some kind of relation: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 6) that "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the genus 'relation' is the useful." Now, in the genus "relation" a thing is denominated not only according to that which is inherent in the thing, but also according to that which is extrinsic to it: as may be seen in the expressions "right" and "left," "equal" and "unequal," and such like. Accordingly, since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of acts consists in their utility to the end, nothing hinders their being called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad according to their proportion to extrinsic things that are adjacent to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Accidents which are altogether <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> are neglected by every art, by reason of their uncertainty and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. But such like <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are not what we call circumstances; because circumstances although, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), they are extrinsic to the act, nevertheless are in a kind of contact with it, by being related to it. Proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, however, come under the consideration of art.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The consideration of circumstances belongs to the moralist, the politician, and the orator. To the moralist, in so far as with respect to circumstances we find or lose the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. To the politician and to the orator, in so far as circumstances make acts to be worthy of praise or blame, of excuse or indictment. In different ways, however: because where the orator persuades, the politician judges. To the theologian this consideration belongs, in all the aforesaid ways: since to him all the other arts are subservient: for he has to consider <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> acts, just as the moralist does; and with the orator and politician he considers acts according as they are deserving of reward or punishment.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the circumstances are properly set forth in the third book of Ethics?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the circumstances are not properly set forth in Ethic. iii, 1. For a circumstance of an act is described as something outside the act. Now time and place answer to this description. Therefore there are only two circumstances, to wit, "when" and "where."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we judge from the circumstances whether a thing is well or ill done. But this belongs to the mode of an act. Therefore all the circumstances are included under one, which is the "mode of acting."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, circumstances are not part of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of an act. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of an act seem to belong to its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore no circumstance should be taken from the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the act itself. Accordingly, neither "who," nor "why," nor "about what," are circumstances: since "who" refers to the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, "why" to the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and "about what" to the material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> is the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> in Ethic. iii, 1.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Tully, in his Rhetoric (De Invent. Rhetor. i), gives seven circumstances, which are contained in this verse:

<blockquote> "Quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando--

<p>Who, what, where, by what aids, why, how, and when." </blockquote> For in acts we must take note of "who" did it, "by what aids" or "instruments" he did it, "what" he did, "where" he did it, "why" he did it, "how" and "when" he did it. But <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> in Ethic. iii, 1 adds yet another, to wit, "about what," which Tully includes in the circumstance "what."

<p>The reason of this enumeration may be set down as follows. For a circumstance is described as something outside the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, and yet in a way touching it. Now this happens in three ways: first, inasmuch as it touches the act itself; secondly, inasmuch as it touches the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the act; thirdly, inasmuch as it touches the effect. It touches the act itself, either by way of measure, as "time" and "place"; or by qualifying the act as the "mode of acting." It touches the effect when we consider "what" is done. It touches the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the act, as to the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, by the circumstance "why"; as to the material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or object, in the circumstance "about what"; as to the principal efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in the circumstance "who"; and as to the instrumental efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in the circumstance "by what aids."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">Time</a> and place surround [circumstant] the act by way of measure; but the others surround the act by touching it in any other way, while they are extrinsic to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This mode "well" or "ill" is not a circumstance, but results from all the circumstances. But the mode which refers to a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the act is a special circumstance; for instance, that a man walk fast or slowly; that he strike hard or gently, and so forth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, on which the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act depends, is not a circumstance; it must be an additional <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. Thus, in regard to the object, it is not a circumstance of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> that the object is another's property, for this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act; but that it be great or small. And the same applies to the other circumstances which are considered in reference to the other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. For the end that specifies the act is not a circumstance, but some additional end. Thus, that a valiant <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> act "valiantly for the sake of" the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, is not a circumstance; but if he act valiantly for the sake of the delivery of the state, or of Christendom, or some such purpose. The same is to be said with regard to the circumstance "what"; for that a man by pouring water on someone should happen to wash him, is not a circumstance of the washing; but that in doing so he give him a chill, or scald him; heal him or harm him, these are circumstances.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the most important circumstances are "why" and "in what the act consists"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that these are not the most important circumstances, namely, "why" and those "in which the act is, [hen ois e praxis]" as stated in Ethic. iii, 1. For those in which the act is seem to be place and time: and these do not seem to be the most important of the circumstances, since, of them all, they are the most extrinsic to the act. Therefore those things in which the act is are not the most important circumstances.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the end of a thing is extrinsic to it. Therefore it is not the most important circumstance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which holds the foremost place in regard to each thing, is its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of an act is the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> that does it; while the form of an act is the manner in which it is done. Therefore these two circumstances seem to be of the greatest importance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxxi.] says that "the most important circumstances" are "why it is done" and "what is done."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 1, Article 1), acts are properly called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, inasmuch as they are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Now, the motive and object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the end. Therefore that circumstance is the most important of all which touches the act on the part of the end, viz. the circumstance "why": and the second in importance, is that which touches the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, viz. the circumstance "what he did." As to the other circumstances, they are more or less important, according as they more or less approach to these.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By those things "in which the act is" the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> does not mean time and place, but those circumstances that are affixed to the act itself. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxx.], as though he were explaining the dictum of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, instead of the latter's term--"in which the act is"--said, "what is done."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the end is not part of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, yet it is the most important <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the act, inasmuch as it moves the agent to act. Wherefore the moral act is specified chiefly by the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> that does the act is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that act, inasmuch as he is moved thereto by the end; and it is chiefly in this respect that he is directed to the act; while other <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> have not such an important relation to the act. As to the mode, it is not the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the act, for in an act the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form depends on the object and term or end; but it is, as it were, a certain <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the act.
