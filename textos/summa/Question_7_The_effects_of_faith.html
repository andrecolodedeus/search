<h1>Question 7. The effects of faith</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3007.htm#article1"> Is fear an effect of faith?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3007.htm#article2"> Is the heart purified by faith?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether fear is an effect of faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fear is not an effect of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For an effect does not precede its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now fear precedes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir002.htm#verse8">Sirach 2:8</a>): "Ye that fear the Lord, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him." Therefore fear is not an effect of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the same thing is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of contraries. Now fear and hope are contraries, as stated above (I-II, 23, 2): and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> begets hope, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse2">Matthew 1:2</a>. Therefore fear is not an effect of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one contrary does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> another. Now the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the First Truth, while the object of fear is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated above (I-II, 42, 1). Again, acts take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the object, according to what was stated above (I-II, 18, 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse19">James 2:19</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> . . . <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and tremble."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Fear is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, as stated above (I-II, 41, 1). Now the principle of all <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movements is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> apprehended: and consequently the principle of fear and of every <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement must be an apprehension. Again, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> there arises in us an apprehension of certain penal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, which are inflicted in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a>. On this way, then, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the fear whereby one dreads to be punished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this is servile fear.

<p>It is also the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of filial fear, whereby one dreads to be separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or whereby one shrinks from equalling oneself to Him, and holds Him in reverence, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> makes us appreciate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as an unfathomable and <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, separation from which is the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and to which it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to wish to be equalled. Of the first fear, viz. servile fear, lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, while living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the second, viz. filial fear, because it makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> adhere to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to be subject to Him by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot altogether precede <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing at all about Him, with regard to rewards and punishments, concerning which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> teaches us, we should nowise fear Him. If, however, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be presupposed in reference to certain <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, for example the Divine excellence, then reverential fear follows, the result of which is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> submits his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in all the Divine promises. Hence the text quoted continues: "And your reward shall not be made void."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The same thing in respect of contraries can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of contraries, but not under the same aspect. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> begets hope, in so far as it enables us to appreciate the prize which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> awards to the just, while it is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear, in so far as it makes us appreciate the punishments which He intends to inflict on sinners.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The primary and formal object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is the First Truth; but the material object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> includes also certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; for instance, that it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> either not to submit to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or to be separated from Him, and that sinners will suffer penal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: in this way <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether faith has the effect of purifying the heart?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not purify the heart. For purity of the heart pertains chiefly to the affections, whereas <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has not the effect of purifying the heart.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which purifies the heart is incompatible with impurity. But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is compatible with the impurity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as may be seen in those who have lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not purify the heart.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were to purify the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart in any way, it would chiefly purify the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now it does not purify the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from obscurity, since it is a veiled <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nowise purifies the heart.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse9">Acts 15:9</a>): "Purifying their hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is impure through being mixed with baser things: for silver is not called impure, when mixed with gold, which betters it, but when mixed with lead or tin. Now it is evident that the rational creature is more excellent than all transient and corporeal creatures; so that it becomes impure through subjecting itself to transient things by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> them. From this impurity the rational creature is purified by means of a contrary movement, namely, by tending to that which is above it, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The first beginning of this movement is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: since "he that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is," according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>. Hence the first beginning of the heart's purifying is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and if this be perfected through being quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, the heart will be perfectly purified thereby.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Things that are in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are the principles of those which are in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, in so far as the apprehended <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> excludes a certain impurity which is contrary to it, viz. that of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and which consists in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, adhering inordinately to things below itself, through wishing to measure Divine things by the rule of sensible objects. But when it is quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, then it is incompatible with any kind of impurity, because "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> covereth all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (<a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse12">Proverbs 10:12</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The obscurity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not pertain to the impurity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but rather to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> defect of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, according to the present state of life.
