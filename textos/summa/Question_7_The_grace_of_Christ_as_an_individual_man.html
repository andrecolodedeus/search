<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether in the Soul of Christ there was any habitual grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem there was no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> assumed by the Word. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a certain partaking of the Godhead by the rational creature, according to <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse4">2 Peter 1:4</a>: "By Whom He hath given us most great and precious promises, that by these you may be made partakers of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not by participation, but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore there was no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that he may operate well, according to <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>: "I have labored more abundantly than all they; yet not I, but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with me"; and in order that he may reach <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (is) life everlasting." Now the inheritance of everlasting life was due to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by the mere fact of His being the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and by the fact of His being the Word, by Whom all things were made, He had the power of doing all things well. Therefore His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> needed no further <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> beyond union with the Word.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what operates as an instrument does not need a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> for its own operations, since <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are rooted in the principal agent. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was "as the instrument of the Godhead," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 15). Therefore there was no need of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> shall rest upon Him"--which (Spirit), indeed, is said to be in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as was said above (I, 8, 3; I, 43, 3,6). Therefore there was <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to suppose <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for three reasons. First, on account of the union of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. For the nearer any recipient is to an inflowing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the more does it partake of its influence. Now the influx of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse12">Psalm 83:12</a>: "The Lord will give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." And hence it was most fitting that His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should receive the influx of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>. Secondly, on account of the dignity of this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whose operations were to attain so closely to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love, to which it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be raised by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Thirdly, on account of the relation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is the "Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men," as is written, <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 2:5</a>; and hence it behooved Him to have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which would overflow upon others, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>: "And of His fulness we have all received, and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Divine Person and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. Yet because together with unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> there remains distinction of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, as stated above (2, 1,2), the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> Divine. Hence it behooves it to be Divine by participation, which is by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, inasmuch as He is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, is due an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> inheritance, which is the uncreated beatitude through the uncreated act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, i.e. the same whereby the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and loves Himself. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not capable of this act, on account of the difference of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. Hence it behooved it to attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> act of fruition which could not be without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Likewise, inasmuch as He was the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, He had the power of doing all things well by the Divine operation. And because it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to admit a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operation, distinct from the Divine operation, as will be shown (19, 1), it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Him to have <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby this operation might be perfect in Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the instrument of the Godhead--not, indeed, an inanimate instrument, which nowise acts, but is merely acted upon; but an instrument animated by a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is so acted upon as to act. And hence the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the action demanded that he should have <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether in Christ there were virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there were no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the plenitude of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act, according to <a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>: "My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for thee." Therefore there were no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 1), <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is contrasted with a "certain heroic or godlike <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>" which is attributed to godlike men. But this belongs chiefly to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but something higher than <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as was said above (I-II, 65, 1,2), all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are bound together. But it was not becoming for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to have all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as is clear in the case of liberality and magnificence, for these have to do with <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spurned, according to <a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse20">Matthew 8:20</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> hath not where to lay His head." Temperance and <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> also regard <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desires, from which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was free. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> on <a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse2">Psalm 1:2</a>, "But His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Lord," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "This refers to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is full of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was full of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (I-II, 110, 3,4), as <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so does <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> regard its power. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that as the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> flow from its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so do the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> flow from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now the more perfect a principle is, the more it impresses its effects. Hence, since the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was most perfect, there flowed from it, in consequence, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which perfect the several powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> acts; and thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> suffices a man for all whereby he is ordained to beatitude; nevertheless, it effects some of these by itself--as to make him pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the like; and some others through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which proceed from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A heroic or godlike <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> only differs from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> commonly so called by a more perfect mode, inasmuch as one is disposed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in a higher way than is common to all. Hence it is not hereby <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but that He had them most perfectly beyond the common mode. In this sense Plotinus gave to a certain sublime degree of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> the name of "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the purified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" (cf. I-II, 61, 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Liberality and magnificence are praiseworthy in regard to <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, inasmuch as anyone does not esteem <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> to the extent of wishing to retain it, so as to forego what ought to be done. But he esteems them least who wholly despises them, and casts them aside for love of perfection. And hence by altogether contemning all <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> showed the highest kind of liberality and magnificence; although He also performed the act of liberality, as far as it became Him, by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> to be distributed to the poor what was given to Himself. Hence, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse21">John 13:21</a>), "That which thou dost do quickly," the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> understood <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> to have ordered him to give something to the poor. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires whatever, as will be shown (15, 1,2); yet He was not thereby prevented from having <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which is the more perfect in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as he is without <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires. Hence, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 9), the temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> differs from the continent in this--that the temperate has not the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires which the continent suffers. Hence, taking <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> in this sense, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> takes it, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, from the very fact that He had all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, had not <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, since it is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but something less than <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether in Christ there was faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a nobler <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and liberality. Now these were in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Much more, therefore, was there <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not teach <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which He had not Himself, according to <a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse1">Acts 1:1</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> began to do and to teach." But of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> it is said (<a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse2">Hebrews 12:2</a>) that He is "the author and finisher of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Therefore there was <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him before all others.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everything imperfect is excluded from the blessed. But in the blessed there is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for on <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse17">Romans 1:17</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is revealed therein from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "From the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of words and hope to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of things and sight." Therefore it would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also there was <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since it implies nothing imperfect.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews 11:1</a>): "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is the evidence of things that appear not." But there was nothing that did not appear to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to what Peter said to Him (<a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse17">John 21:17</a>): "Thou <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowest</a> all things." Therefore there was no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (II-II, 1, 4), the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a Divine thing not seen. Now the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as every other <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the object. Hence, if we deny that the Divine thing was not seen, we exclude the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now from the first moment of His conception <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Essence fully, as will be made clear (34, 1). Hence there could be no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is a nobler <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, seeing that it has to do with nobler <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; nevertheless, it implies a certain defect with regard to that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and this defect was not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And hence there could be no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him, although the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were in Him, since in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> they imply no defect with regard to their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> consists in this--that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through obedience assents to what things he does not see, according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse5">Romans 1:5</a>: "For obedience to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in all nations for His name." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had most perfect obedience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians 2:8</a>: "Becoming obedient unto death." And hence He taught nothing pertaining to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> which He did not fulfil more perfectly Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says in the same place, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is that "whereby such things as are not seen are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>." But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in things seen is improperly so called, and only after a certain similitude with regard to the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> and firmness of the assent.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether in Christ there was hope?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was hope in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it is said in the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse1">Psalm 30:1</a>): "In Thee, O Lord, have I hoped." But the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope is that whereby a man hopes in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, hope is the expectation of the bliss to come, as was shown above (II-II, 17, 5, ad 3). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> awaited something pertaining to bliss, viz. the glorifying of His body. Therefore it seems there was hope in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everyone may hope for what pertains to his perfection, if it has yet to come. But there was something still to come pertaining to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> perfection, according to <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse12">Ephesians 4:12</a>: "For the perfecting of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, for the work of the ministry, for the building up [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'edifying'] of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Hence it seems that it befitted <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to have hope.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans 8:24</a>): "What a man seeth, why doth he hope for?" Thus it is clear that as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of the unseen, so also is hope. But there was no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>): neither, consequently, was there hope.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As it is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that one assents to what one sees not, so is it of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of hope that one expects what as yet one has not; and as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, forasmuch as it is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, does not regard everything unseen, but only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so likewise hope, as a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, has <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself for its object, the fruition of Whom <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> chiefly expects by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope; yet, in consequence, whoever has the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope may expect the Divine aid in other things, even as he who has the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not only in Divine things, but even in whatsoever is <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divinely revealed</a>. Now from the beginning of His conception <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the Divine fruition fully, as will be shown (34, 4), and hence he had not the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope. Nevertheless He had hope as regards such things as He did not yet possess, although He had not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with regard to anything; because, although He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all things fully, wherefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was altogether wanting to Him, nevertheless He did not as yet fully possess all that pertained to His perfection, viz. <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body, which He could hope for.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This is said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with reference to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, not as a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but inasmuch as He hoped for some other things not yet possessed, as was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body does not pertain to beatitude as being that in which beatitude principally consists, but by a certain outpouring from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as was said above (I-II, 4, 6). Hence hope, as a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, does not regard the bliss of the body but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> bliss, which consists in the Divine fruition.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The building up of the church by the conversion of the faithful does not pertain to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whereby He is perfect in Himself, but inasmuch as it leads others to a share of His perfection. And because hope properly regards what is expected by him who hopes, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope cannot properly be said to be in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because of the aforesaid reason.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether in Christ there were the gifts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> were not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For, as is commonly said, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are given to help the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But what is perfect in itself does not need an exterior help. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were perfect, it seems there were no <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to give and to receive <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> would not seem to belong to the same; since to give pertains to one who has, and to receive pertains to one who has not. But it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to give <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> according to <a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse19">Psalm 67:19</a>. "Thou hast given <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Thou hast received <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> in men']." Therefore it was not becoming that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should receive <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, four <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> would seem to pertain to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of earth, viz. wisdom, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, understanding, and counsel which pertains to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 3) enumerates these with the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore He had not these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa004.htm#verse1">Isaiah 4:1</a>): "Seven <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> shall take hold of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>": on which a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "That is, the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall take hold of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (I-II, 68, 1), the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, properly, are certain perfections of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers, inasmuch a[9] these have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to be moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse1">Luke 4:1</a>: "And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, being full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> into the desert." Hence it is manifest that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> were in a pre-eminent degree.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> What is perfect in the order of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> needs to be helped by something of a higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, however perfect, needs to be helped by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And in this way the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which perfect the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as they are controlled by reason, no matter how perfect they are, need to be helped by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, which perfect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers, inasmuch as these are moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not a recipient and a giver of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in the same respect; for He gives them as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and receives them as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii) that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> never quitted the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, from Whose Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> He proceedeth."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was not only heavenly <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, but also earthly <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, as will be said (15, 10). And yet even in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> will still <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, in a certain manner, as was said above (I-II, 68, 6).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether in Christ there was the gift of fear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was not the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear. For hope would seem to be stronger than fear; since the object of hope is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and of fear, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. as was said above (I-II, 40, 1; I-II, 42, 1). But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was not the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope, as was said above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Hence, likewise, there was not the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear we fear either to be separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which pertains to "chaste" fear--or to be punished by Him, which pertains to "servile" fear, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (In Joan. Tract. ix). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not fear being separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor being punished by Him on account of a fault, since it was impossible for Him to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as will be said (15, 1,2). Now fear is not of the impossible. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was not the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1 John 4:18</a>) that "perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> casteth out fear." But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was most perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse19">Ephesians 3:19</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which surpasseth all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was not the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse3">Isaiah 11:3</a>): "And He shall be filled with the spirit of the fear of the Lord."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (I-II, 42, 1), fear regards two objects, one of which is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> terror; the other is that by whose power an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can be inflicted, as we fear the king inasmuch as he has the power of putting to death. Now whoever can hurt would not be feared unless he had a certain greatness of might, to which resistance could not easily be offered; for what we easily repel we do not fear. And hence it is plain that no one is feared except for some pre-eminence. And in this way it is said that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not indeed as it regards the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by fault, nor as it regards the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment for fault; but inasmuch as it regards the Divine pre-eminence, on account of which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, was borne towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in an act of reverence. Hence it is said (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse7">Hebrews 5:7</a>) that in all things "he was heard for his reverence." For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had this act of reverence towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a fuller sense and beyond all others. And hence <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> attributes to Him the fulness of the fear of the Lord.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> regard <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> properly and of themselves; but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, consequently; since it pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to render acts <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as is said Ethic. ii, 6. And hence the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear regards not that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which fear is concerned with, but the pre-eminence of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, viz. of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by Whose power <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may be inflicted. on the other hand, hope, as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, regards not only the author of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but even the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> itself, as far as it is not yet possessed. And hence to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who already possessed the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of beatitude, we do not attribute the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope, but we do attribute the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This reason is based on fear in so far as it regards the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> casts out servile fear, which principally regards punishment. But this kind of fear was not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the gratuitous graces were in Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> were not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For whoever has anything in its fulness, to him it does not pertain to have it by participation. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in its fulness, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>: "Full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> would seem to be certain participations, bestowed distributively and particularly upon divers subjects, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 12:4</a>: "Now there are diversities of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>." Therefore it would seem that there were no gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is due to anyone would not seem to be gratuitously bestowed on him. But it was due to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> that He should abound in the word of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and to be mighty in doing wonderful works and the like, all of which pertain to gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>: since He is "the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as is written <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>. Therefore it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to have the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> are ordained to the benefit of the faithful. But it does not seem that a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which a man does not use is for the benefit of others, according to <a href="../bible/sir020.htm#verse32">Sirach 20:32</a>: "Wisdom that is hid and treasure that is not seen: what profit is there in them both?" Now we do not read that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> made use of these gratuitously given <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, especially as regards the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a>. Therefore not all the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> were in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Dardan. cclxxxvii) that "as in the head are all the senses, so in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were all the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (I-II, 3, 1,4), the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> are ordained for the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> doctrine. For it behooves him who teaches to have the means of making his doctrine clear; otherwise his doctrine would be useless. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the first and chief teacher of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> doctrine and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse3">Hebrews 2:3-4</a>: "Which having begun to be declared by the Lord was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also bearing them witness by signs and wonders." Hence it is clear that all the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> were most excellently in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as in the first and chief teacher of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is ordained to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> acts both interior and exterior, so likewise gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is ordained to certain exterior acts manifestive of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and the like. Now of both these <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the fulness. since inasmuch as His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was united to the Godhead, He had the perfect power of effecting all these acts. But other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as separated and not united instruments, receive power in a particular manner in order to bring about this or that act. And hence in other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> these <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> are divided, but not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as He is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But in this respect it does not pertain to Him to have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but rather to be the bestower of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. but it pertains to Him in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> was bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, because they were sent to teach all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>; but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to preach personally only in the one nation of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, as He Himself says (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>): "I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>"; and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse8">Romans 15:8</a>): "I say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> was minister of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>." And hence it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Him to speak several languages. Yet was a <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of all languages not wanting to Him, since even the secrets of hearts, of which all words are signs, were not hidden from Him, as will be shown (10, 2). Nor was this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> uselessly possessed. just as it is not useless to have a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, which we do not use when there is no occasion.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether in Christ there was the gift of prophecy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was not the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> implies a certain obscure and imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to <a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse6">Numbers 12:6</a>: "If there be among you a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had full and unveiled <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, much more than <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, of whom it is subjoined that "plainly and not by riddles and figures doth he see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/num006.htm#verse8">Numbers 6:8</a>). Therefore we ought not to admit <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has to do with what is not seen, and hope with what is not possessed, so <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> has to do with what is not present, but distant; for a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> means, as it were, a teller of far-off things. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there could be neither <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor hope, as was said above (3,4). Hence <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> also ought not to be admitted in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is in an inferior order to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who was the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as was said above (II-II, 174, 4) is said (<a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse38">Acts 7:38</a>) to have spoken with an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in the desert. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was "made lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>," not as to the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but only as regards the sufferings of His body, as is shown <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse9">Hebrews 2:9</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written of Him (<a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>): "Thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will raise up to thee a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of thy nation and of thy brethren," and He says of Himself (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse57">Matthew 13:57</a>; <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse44">John 4:44</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is not without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, save in his own country."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> means, as it were, a teller or seer of far-off things, inasmuch as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and announces what things are far from men's senses, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xvi, 18). Now we must bear in mind that no one can be called a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> and announcing what is distant from others, with whom he is not. And this is clear in regard to place and time. For if anyone living in France were to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and announce to others living in France what things were transpiring in Syria, it would be prophetical, as Eliseus told Giezi (<a href="../bible/2ki005.htm#verse26">2 Kings 5:26</a>) how the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had leaped down from his chariot to meet him. But if anyone living in Syria were to announce what things were there, it would not be prophetical. And the same appears in regard to time. For it was prophetical of Isaias to announce that Cyrus, King of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, would rebuild the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as is clear from <a href="../bible/isa044.htm#verse28">Isaiah 44:28</a>. But it was not prophetical of Esdras to write it, in whose time it took place. Hence if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or even the blessed, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and announce what is beyond our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, this does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, since they nowise touch our state. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> touched our state, inasmuch as He was not merely a "comprehensor," but a "wayfarer." Hence it was prophetical in Him to <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> and announce what was beyond the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of other "wayfarers": and for this reason He is called a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words do not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that enigmatical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, viz. by dream and vision, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; but the comparison is drawn between other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who saw Divine things in dreams and visions, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> plainly and not by riddles, and who yet is called a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, according to <a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 24:10</a>: "And there arose no more a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> like unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>." Nevertheless it may be said that although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had full and unveiled <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> as regards the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part, yet in the imaginative part He had certain similitudes, in which Divine things could be viewed, inasmuch as He was not only a "comprehensor," but a "wayfarer."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> regards such things as are unseen by him who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>; and hope, too, is of such things as are not possessed by the one who hopes; but <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is of such things as are beyond the sense of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, with whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> dwells and converses in this state of life. And hence <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope are repugnant to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> beatitude; but <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is not.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Angels, being "comprehensors," are above <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who are merely "wayfarers"; but not above <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who was both a "comprehensor" and a "wayfarer."

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether in Christ there was the fulness of grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was not the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> flow from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as was said above (I-II, 110, 4). But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there were not all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; for there was neither <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor hope in Him, as was shown above (3,4). Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was not the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as is plain from what was said above (I-II, 111, 2), <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is divided into operating and cooperating. Now operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> signifies that whereby the ungodly is justified, which has no place in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who never lay under any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was not the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse17">James 1:17</a>): "Every best <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> and every perfect <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is from above, coming down from the Father of lights." But what comes thus is possessed partially, and not fully. Therefore no creature, not even the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, can have the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>): "We saw Him [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>'] full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To have fully is to have wholly and perfectly. Now totality and perfection can be taken in two ways: First as regards their "intensive" <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; for instance, I may say that some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has whiteness fully, because he has as much of it as can <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> be in him; secondly, "as regards power"; for instance, if anyone be said to have life fully, inasmuch as he has it in all the effects or works of life; and thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has life fully, but senseless animals or plants have not. Now in both these ways <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. First, since He has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in its highest degree, in the most perfect way it can be had. And this appears, first, from the nearness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For it was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) that the nearer a recipient is to the inflowing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the more it receives. And hence the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is more closely united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than all other rational creatures, receives the greatest outpouring of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Secondly, in His relation to the effect. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> so received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that, in a manner, it is poured out from it upon others. And hence it behooved Him to have the greatest <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; as fire which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of heat in other hot things, is of all things the hottest.

<p>Likewise, as regards the "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, He had <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> fully, since He had it for all the operations and effects of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and this, because <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was bestowed on Him, as upon a universal principle in the genus of such as have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the first principle of a genus universally extends itself to all the effects of that genus; thus the force of the sun, which is the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of generation, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. i), extends to all things that come under generation. Hence the second fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is seen in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> inasmuch as His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> extends to all the effects of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which are the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, and the like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and hope signify effects of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with certain defects on the part of the recipient of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of the unseen, and hope of what is not yet possessed. Hence it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is the author of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, there should be any defects such as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope imply; but whatever perfection is in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> most perfectly; as in fire there are not all the modes of heat which are defective by the subject's defect, but whatever belongs to the perfection of heat.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It pertains <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to justify; but that it makes the ungodly to be just is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to it on the part of the subject, in which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is found. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was justified by operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, inasmuch as it was rendered just and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> by it from the beginning of His conception; not that it was until then <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, or even not just.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to the capacity of the creature and not by comparison with the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> fulness of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether the fulness of grace is proper to Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For what is proper to anyone belongs to him alone. But to be full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is attributed to some others; for it was said to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse28">Luke 1:28</a>): "Hail, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>"; and again it is written (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#verse8">Acts 6:8</a>): "<a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">Stephen</a>, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>." Therefore the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what can be communicated to others through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not seem to be proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can be communicated to others through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse19">Ephesians 3:19</a>): "That you may be filled unto all the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the state of the wayfarer seems to be proportioned to the state of the comprehensor. But in the state of the comprehensor there will be a certain fulness, since "in our heavenly country with its fulness of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, although some things are bestowed in a pre-eminent way, yet nothing is possessed singularly," as is clear from <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. De Cent. Ovib.; xxxiv in Ev.). Therefore in the state of the comprehensor the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is possessed by everyone, and hence the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. on the contrary, The fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is attributed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> inasmuch as He is the only-begotten of the Father, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>: "We saw Him [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>'] as it were . . . the Only-begotten of the Father, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But to be the Only-begotten of the Father is proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore it is proper to Him to be full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be taken in two ways: First, on the part of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself, or secondly on the part of the one who has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now on the part of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself there is said to be the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> when the limit of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is attained, as to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and power, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is possessed in its highest possible excellence and in its greatest possible extension to all its effects. And this fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But on the part of the subject there is said to be the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> when anyone fully possesses <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> according to his <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>--whether as regards intensity, by reason of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> being intense in him, to the limit assigned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse1">Ephesians 4:1</a>: "But to every one of us is given <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> according to the measure of the giving of Christ"--or "as regards power," by reason of a man having the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for all that belongs to his office or state, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse8">Ephesians 3:8</a>): "To me, the least of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, is given this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> . . . to enlighten all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." And this fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but is communicated to others by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is said to be full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not on the part of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself--since she had not <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in its greatest possible excellence--nor for all the effects of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but she is said to be full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in reference to herself, i.e. inasmuch as she had sufficient <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for the state to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had chosen her, i.e. to be the mother of His Only-begotten. So, too, <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">Stephen</a> is said to be full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since he had sufficient <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to be a fit minister and witness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to which office he had been called. And the same must be said of others. Of these fulnesses one is greater than another, according as one is divinely pre-ordained to a higher or lower state.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is there speaking of that fulness which has reference to the subject, in comparison with what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is divinely pre-ordained to; and this is either something in common, to which all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are pre-ordained, or something special, which pertains to the pre-eminence of some. And in this manner a certain fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is common to all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, viz. to have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> enough to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, which consists in the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this is the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> desires for the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to whom he writes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> which are in common in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, viz.: vision, possession and fruition, and the like, have certain <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> corresponding to them in this life which are also common to all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Yet there are certain prerogatives of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, both in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and on earth, which are not possessed by all.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether the grace of Christ is infinite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. For everything immeasurable is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is immeasurable; since it is written (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse34">John 3:34</a>): "For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth not give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> by measure to His Son ['To His Son' is lacking in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> effect betokens an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power which can only spring from an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But the effect of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, since it extends to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; for He is the propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> . . . and for those of the whole world, as is said (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse2">1 John 2:2</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every finite thing by addition can attain to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of any other finite thing. Therefore if the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is finite the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could increase to such an extent as to reach to an equality with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, against what is written (<a href="../bible/job028.htm#verse17">Job 28:17</a>): "Gold nor crystal cannot equal it," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> expounds it (Moral. xviii). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> is something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing is finite, according to <a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse21">Wisdom 11:21</a>: "Thou hast ordered all things in measure and number and weight." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was made clear above (Question 2, Article 10), a twofold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be considered in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; the first being the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union, which, as was said (6, 6), is for Him to be personally united to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, which union has been bestowed gratis on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and it is clear that this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, as the Person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. The second is <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; which may be taken in two ways: first as a being, and in this way it must be a finite being, since it is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as in a subject, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a creature having a finite capacity; hence the being of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, since it cannot exceed its subject. Secondly it may be viewed in its specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and thus the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> can be termed <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, since it is not limited, i.e. it has whatsoever can pertain to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and what pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not bestowed on Him in a fixed measure; seeing that "according to the purpose" of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to Whom it pertains to measure <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it is bestowed on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as on a universal principle for bestowing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse5">Ephesians 1:5-6</a>, "He hath graced us in His beloved Son"; thus we might say that the light of the sun is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, not indeed in being, but in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of light, as having whatever can pertain to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of light.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When it is said that the Father "doth not give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> by measure," it may be expounded of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> gave the Son, viz. the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, which is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. Hence the comment of a certain <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>: "So that the Son may be as great as the Father is." Or again, it may be referred to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> which is given the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to be united to the Divine Person, and this also is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on this text: "As the Father begot a full and perfect Word, it is united thus full and perfect to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Thirdly, it may be referred to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> extends to whatever belongs to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounding this (Tract. xiv in Joan.) says: "The division of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> is a measurement. For to one indeed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is given the word of wisdom, to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the giver does not receive by measure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> effect, both because of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and because of the unity [Perhaps we should read '<a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>'--Ed.] of the Divine Person, to Whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The lesser can attain by augment to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the greater, when both have the same kind of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is compared to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as a particular to a universal power; hence as the force of fire, no matter how much it increases, can never equal the sun's strength, so the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of a man, no matter how much it increases, can never equal the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether the grace of Christ could increase?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could increase. For to every finite thing addition can be made. But the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was finite. Therefore it could increase.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is by Divine power that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is increased, according to <a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse8">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>: "And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able to make all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> abound in you." But the Divine power, being <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, is confined by no limits. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could have been greater.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse52">Luke 2:52</a>) that the child "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> advanced in wisdom and age and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could increase.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>): "We saw Him [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>'] as it were . . . the Only-begotten of the Father, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But nothing can be or can be thought greater than that anyone should be the Only-begotten of the Father. Therefore no greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can be or can be thought than that of which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was full.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> For a form to be incapable of increase happens in two ways: First on the part of the subject; secondly, on the part of the form itself. On the part of the subject, indeed, when the subject reaches the utmost limit wherein it partakes of this form, after its own manner, e.g. if we say that air cannot increase in heat, when it has reached the utmost limit of heat which can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of air, although there may be greater heat in actual <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, viz. the heat of fire. But on the part of the form, the possibility of increase is excluded when a subject reaches the utmost perfection which this form can have by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, e.g. if we say the heat of fire cannot be increased because there cannot be a more perfect grade of heat than that to which fire attains. Now the proper measure of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, like that of other forms, is determined by the Divine wisdom, according to <a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse21">Wisdom 11:21</a>: "Thou hast ordered all things in number, weight and measure." And it is with reference to its end that a measure is set to every form. as there is no greater gravity than that of the earth, because there is no lower place than that of the earth. Now the end of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the union of the rational creature with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But there can neither be nor be thought a greater union of the rational creature with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than that which is in the Person. And hence the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> reached the highest measure of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> cannot be increased on the part of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But neither can it be increased on the part of the subject, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and full comprehensor from the first instant of His conception. Hence there could have been no increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in Him, as there could be none in the rest of the blessed, whose <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> could not increase, seeing that they have reached their last end. But as regards men who are wholly wayfarers, their <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can be increased not merely on the part of the form, since they have not attained the highest degree of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but also on the part of the subject, since they have not yet attained their end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If we speak of mathematical <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, addition can be made to any finite <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, since there is nothing on the part of finite <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> which is repugnant to addition. But if we speak of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, there may be repugnance on the part of the form to which a determined <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is due, even as other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are determined. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 41) that "there is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> a term of all things, and a fixed limit of magnitude and increase." And hence to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the whole there can be no addition. And still more must we suppose a term in the forms themselves, beyond which they may not go. Hence it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that addition should be capable of being made to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, although it is finite in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the Divine power can make something greater and better than the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, yet it could not make it to be ordained to anything greater than the personal union with the Only-begotten Son of the Father; and to this union, by the purpose of the Divine wisdom, the measure of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Anyone may increase in wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in two ways. First inasmuch as the very <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are increased; and in this way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not increase. Secondly, as regards the effects, i.e. inasmuch as they do wiser and greater works; and in this way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> increased in wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> even as in age, since in the course of time He did more perfect works, to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> Himself <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, both in the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the things of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<h2 id="article13">Article 13. Whether the habitual grace of Christ followed after the union?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> did not follow after the union. For nothing follows itself. But this <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> seems to be the same as the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praedest. Sanct. xv): "Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> from the beginning of his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, by the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby this Man from His beginning became Christ"; and of these two the first pertains to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and the second to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> did not follow upon the union.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, disposition precedes perfection, if not in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, at least in thought. But the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> seems to be a disposition in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> for the personal union. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> did not follow but rather preceded the union.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the common precedes the proper. But <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is common to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and other men; and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union is proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is prior in thought to the union. Therefore it does not follow it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse1">Isaiah 42:1</a>): "Behold my servant, I will uphold Him . . . "and farther on: "I have given My Spirit upon Him"; and this pertains to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence it remains that the assumption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the unity of the Person preceded the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The union of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the Divine Person, which, as we have said above (2, 10; 6, 6), is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union, precedes the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not in order of time, but by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and in thought; and this for a triple reason: First, with reference to the order of the principles of both. For the principle of the union is the Person of the Son assuming <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, Who is said to be sent into the world, inasmuch as He assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but the principle of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is given with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is said to be sent inasmuch as He dwells in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now the mission of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is prior, in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to the mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, even as in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds from the Son, and love from wisdom. Hence the personal union, according to which the mission of the Son took place, is prior in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to which the mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> takes place. Secondly, the reason of this order may be taken from the relation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the presence of the Godhead, as light in the air by the presence of the sun. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/eze043.htm#verse2">Ezekiel 43:2</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> came in by the way of the east . . . and the earth shone with His majesty." But the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is by the union of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the Divine Person. Hence the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is understood to follow this union, as light follows the sun. Thirdly, the reason of this union can be taken from the end of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since it is ordained to acting rightly, and action belongs to the suppositum and the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Hence action and, in consequence, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> ordaining thereto, presuppose the hypostasis which operates. Now the hypostasis did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> before the union, as is clear from 4, 2]. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union precedes, in thought, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> here means by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> the gratuitous will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, bestowing benefits gratis; and hence every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be made a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> by the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby a Man became <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since both take place by the gratuitous will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As disposition in the order of generation precedes the perfection to which it disposes, in such things as are gradually perfected; so it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> follows the perfection which one has already obtained; as heat, which was a disposition to the form of fire, is an effect flowing from the form of already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> fire. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is united to the Person of the Word from the beginning without succession. Hence <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not understood to have preceded the union, but to have followed it; as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> property. Hence, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xl): "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> is in a manner <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The common precedes the proper, when both are of the same genus; but when they are of divers genera, there is nothing to prevent the proper being prior to the common. Now the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union is not in the same genus as <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but is above all genera even as the Divine Person Himself. Hence there is nothing to prevent this proper from being before the common since it does not result from something being added to the common, but is rather the principle and source of that which is common.
