<h1>Question 7. The infinity of God</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1007.htm#article1"> Is God infinite?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1007.htm#article2"> Is anything besides Him infinite in essence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1007.htm#article3"> Can anything be infinite in magnitude?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1007.htm#article4"> Can an infinite multitude exist?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether God is infinite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. For everything <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is imperfect, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says; because it has parts and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as is said in Phys. iii. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is most perfect; therefore He is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. i), finite and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> belong to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But there is no <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He is not a body, as was shown above (Question 3, Article 1). Therefore it does not belong to Him to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is here in such a way as not to be elsewhere, is finite according to place. Therefore that which is a thing in such a way as not to be another thing, is finite according to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is this, and not another; for He is not a stone or wood. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. i, 4) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and boundless."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All the ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> attribute <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitude</a> to the first principle, as is said (Phys. iii), and with reason; for they considered that things flow forth <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> from the first principle. But because some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the first principle, as a consequence they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> also concerning its <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>; forasmuch as they asserted that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was the first principle; consequently they attributed to the first principle a material <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> to the effect that some <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> body was the first principle of things.

<p>We must consider therefore that a thing is called <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> because it is not finite. Now <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in a way made finite by <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">Matter</a> indeed is made finite by <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, before it receives its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to many <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">forms</a>; but on receiving a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, it is terminated by that one. Again, <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is made finite by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, considered in itself, is common to many; but when received in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is determined to this one particular thing. Now <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is perfected by the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> by which it is made finite; therefore <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> as attributed to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of something imperfect; for it is as it were formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is not made perfect by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but rather is contracted by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and hence the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, regarded on the part of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> not determined by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of something perfect. Now being is the most <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> of all things, as appears from what is shown above (4, 1, Objection 3). Since therefore the divine being is not a being received in anything, but He is His own subsistent being as was shown above (Question 3, Article 4), it is clear that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> and perfect.

<p>From this appears the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">Quantity</a> is terminated by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, which can be seen in the fact that a figure which consists in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> terminated, is a kind of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantitative</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; such a kind of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> cannot be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as was said above, in this article.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fact that the being of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is self-subsisting, not received in any other, and is thus called <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, shows Him to be distinguished from all other beings, and all others to be apart from Him. Even so, were there such a thing as a self-subsisting whiteness, the very fact that it did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in anything else, would make it distinct from every other whiteness <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in a subject.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether anything but God can be essentially infinite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that something else besides <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. For the power of anything is proportioned to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now if the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, His power must also be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore He can produce an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> effect, since the extent of a power is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its effect.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever has <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, has an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now the created <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power; for it apprehends the universal, which can extend itself to an infinitude of singular things. Therefore every created <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is something other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was shown above (Question 3, Article 8). But primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore something besides <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> cannot have a beginning, as said in Phys. iii. But everything outside <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as from its first principle. Therefore besides <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nothing can be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Things other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be relatively <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, but not absolutely <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. For with regard to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> as applied to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it is manifest that everything actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> possesses a form; and thus its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is determined by form. But because <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, considered as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> under some <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, remains in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to many <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> forms, which is absolutely finite can be relatively <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; as, for example, wood is finite according to its own form, but still it is relatively <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, inasmuch as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of shapes. But if we speak of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in reference to form, it is manifest that those things, the forms of which are in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, are absolutely finite, and in no way <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. If, however, any created forms are not received into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but are self-subsisting, as some think is the case with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, these will be relatively <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, inasmuch as such kinds of forms are not terminated, nor contracted by any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But because a created form thus subsisting has being, and yet is not its own being, it follows that its being is received and contracted to a determinate <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence it cannot be absolutely <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a made thing for its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> to be its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; because subsisting being is not a created being; hence it is against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a made thing to be absolutely <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although He has <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, cannot make a thing to be not made (for this would imply that two contradictories are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> at the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>), so likewise He cannot make anything to be absolutely <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The fact that the power of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> extends itself in a way to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things, is because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a form not in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but either wholly separated from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, or at least an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power, which is not the act of any organ, in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> joined to a body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> by itself in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since it is not actually being, but <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> only; hence it is something concreated rather than created. Nevertheless, primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> even as a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is not absolutely <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, but relatively, because its <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> extends only to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forms.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether an actually infinite magnitude can exist?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there can be something actually <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in magnitude. For in mathematics there is no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, since "there is no lie in things abstract," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii). But mathematics uses the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in magnitude; thus, the geometrician in his demonstrations says, "Let this line be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>." Therefore it is not impossible for a thing to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in magnitude.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is not against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of anything, can agree with it. Now to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is not against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of magnitude; but rather both the finite and the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> seem to be properties of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Therefore it is not impossible for some magnitude to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, magnitude is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> divisible, for the continuous is defined that which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> divisible, as is clear from Phys. iii. But contraries are concerned about one and the same thing. Since therefore addition is opposed to division, and increase opposed to diminution, it appears that magnitude can be increased to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Therefore it is possible for magnitude to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, movement and time have <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> and continuity derived from the magnitude over which movement passes, as is said in Phys. iv. But it is not against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and movement to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, since every determinate indivisible in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and circular movement is both a beginning and an end. Therefore neither is it against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of magnitude to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every body has a surface. But every body which has a surface is finite; because surface is the term of a finite body. Therefore all bodies are finite. The same applies both to surface and to a line. Therefore nothing is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in magnitude.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is one thing to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and another to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in magnitude. For granted that a body <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in magnitude, as fire or air, yet this could not be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, because its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> would be terminated in a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and confined to individuality by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. And so assuming from these premises that no creature is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it still remains to inquire whether any creature can be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in magnitude.

<p>We must therefore observe that a body, which is a complete magnitude, can be considered in two ways; mathematically, in respect to its <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> only; and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, as regards its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p>Now it is manifest that a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body cannot be actually <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body has some determined <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form. Since therefore the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> follow upon the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that determinate <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> should follow upon a determinate form; and among these <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> is <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. So every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body has a greater or smaller determinate <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Hence it is impossible for a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. The same appears from movement; because every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body has some <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement; whereas an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> body could not have any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement; neither direct, because nothing moves <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> by a direct movement unless it is out of its place; and this could not happen to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> body, for it would occupy every place, and thus every place would be indifferently its own place. Neither could it move circularly; forasmuch as circular motion requires that one part of the body is necessarily transferred to a place occupied by another part, and this could not happen as regards an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> circular body: for if two lines be drawn from the centre, the farther they extend from the centre, the farther they are from each other; therefore, if a body were <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, the lines would be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> distant from each other; and thus one could never occupy the place belonging to any other.

<p>The same applies to a mathematical body. For if we <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a mathematical body actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, we must <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> it under some form, because nothing is actual except by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; hence, since the form of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> as such is figure, such a body must have some figure, and so would be finite; for figure is confined by a term or boundary.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A geometrician does not need to assume a line actually <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, but takes some actually finite line, from which he subtracts whatever he finds <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; which line he calls <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is not against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of magnitude in general, still it is against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of any <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of it; thus, for instance, it is against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a bicubical or tricubical magnitude, whether circular or triangular, and so on. Now what is not possible in any <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the genus; hence there cannot be any <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> magnitude, since no <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of magnitude is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as was shown above, belongs to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now by division of the whole we approach to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, forasmuch as parts have the aspect of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; but by addition we approach to the whole which has the aspect of a form. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is not in the addition of magnitude, but only in division.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Movement and <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> are whole, not actually but successively; hence they have <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> mixed with <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>. But magnitude is an actual whole; therefore the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> refers to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and does not agree with the totality of magnitude; yet it agrees with the totality of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and movement: for it is proper to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether an infinite multitude can exist?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that an actually <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> multitude is possible. For it is not impossible for a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to be made actual. But number can be multiplied to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Therefore it is possible for an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> multitude actually to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is possible for any individual of any <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to be made actual. But the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of figures are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of actual figures is possible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things not opposed to each other do not obstruct each other. But supposing a multitude of things to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, there can still be many others not opposed to them. Therefore it is not impossible for others also to coexist with them, and so on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitude</a>; therefore an actual <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of things is possible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written, "Thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight" (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse21">Wisdom 11:21</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A twofold opinion <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> on this subject. Some, as <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> and Algazel, said that it was impossible for an actually <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> multitude to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> absolutely; but that an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> multitude was not impossible. A multitude is said to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> absolutely, when an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> multitude is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that something may <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. Now this is impossible; because it would entail something dependent on an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> for its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and hence its generation could never come to be, because it is impossible to pass through an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> medium.

<p>A multitude is said to be <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> when its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as such is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. This can be shown, for example, in the work of a carpenter requiring a certain absolute multitude; namely, art in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the movement of the hand, and a hammer; and supposing that such things were <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> multiplied, the carpentering work would never be finished, forasmuch as it would depend on an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. But the multitude of hammers, inasmuch as one may be broken and another used, is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> multitude; for it happens by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> that many hammers are used, and it matters little whether one or two, or many are used, or an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number, if the work is carried on for an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> time. In this way they said that there can be an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> multitude.

<p>This, however, is impossible; since every kind of multitude must belong to a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of multitude. Now the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of multitude are to be reckoned by the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of numbers. But no <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of number is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; for every number is multitude measured by one. Hence it is impossible for there to be an actually <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> multitude, either absolute or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. Likewise multitude in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is created; and everything created is comprehended under some clear intention of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>; for no agent acts aimlessly. Hence everything created must be comprehended in a certain number. Therefore it is impossible for an actually <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> multitude to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, even <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> multitude is possible; because the increase of multitude follows upon the division of magnitude; since the more a thing is divided, the greater number of things result. Hence, as the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is to be found <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> in the division of the continuous, because we thus approach <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as was shown in the preceding article, by the same rule, the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> can be also found <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> in the addition of multitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is made actual according to its mode of being; for instance, a day is reduced to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">act</a> successively, and not all at once. Likewise the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in multitude is reduced to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">act</a> successively, and not all at once; because every multitude can be succeeded by another multitude to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Species of figures are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> by <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitude</a> of number. Now there are various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of figures, such as trilateral, quadrilateral and so on; and as an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> numerable multitude is not all at once reduced to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">act</a>, so neither is the multitude of figures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the supposition of some things does not preclude the supposition of others, still the supposition of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number is opposed to any single <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of multitude. Hence it is not possible for an <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">actually</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> multitude to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.
