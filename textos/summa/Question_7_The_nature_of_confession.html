<h1>Question 7. The nature of confession</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5007.htm#article1"> Does Augustine fittingly define confession?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5007.htm#article2"> Is confession an act of virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5007.htm#article3"> Is confession an act of the virtue of penance?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Augustine fittingly defines confession?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> defines confession unfittingly, when he says (Super Ps. 21) that confession "lays bare the hidden disease by the hope of pardon." For the disease against which confession is ordained, is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is sometimes manifest. Therefore it should not be said that confession is the remedy for a "hidden" disease.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the beginning of penance is fear. But confession is a part of Penance. Therefore fear rather than "hope" should be set down as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of confession.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is placed under a seal, is not laid bare, but closed up. But the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is confessed is placed under the seal of confession. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not laid bare in confession, but closed up.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, other definitions are to be found differing from the above. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xl in Evang.) that confession is "the uncovering of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the opening of the wound." Others say that "confession is a legal declaration of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the presence of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>." Others define it thus: "Confession is the sinner's sacramental self-accusation through shame for what he has done, which through the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> makes satisfaction for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and binds him to perform the penance imposed on him." Therefore it seems that the definition in question is insufficient, since it does not include all that these include.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Several things offer themselves to our notice in the act of confession: first, the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or genus of the act, which is a kind of manifestation; secondly, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> manifested, viz. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; thirdly, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom the manifestation is made, viz. the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; fourthly, its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, viz. hope of pardon; fifthly, its effect, viz. release from part of the punishment, and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to pay the other part. Accordingly the first definition, given by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, indicates the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, by saying that "it lays bare"--the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of confession, by saying that it is a "hidden disease"--its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is "the hope of pardon"; while the other definitions include one or other of the five things aforesaid, as may be seen by anyone who considers the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as a man, may sometimes have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the penitent's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it as a vicar of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (even as a judge sometimes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a thing, as a man, of which he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, as a judge), and in this respect it is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him by confession. or we may reply that although the external act may be in the open, yet the internal act, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the external act, is hidden; so that it needs to be revealed by confession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Confession presupposes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which gives us life, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 17). Now it is in <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is given; while servile fear, which is void of hope, is previous to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: yet he that has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is moved more by hope than by fear. Hence hope rather than fear is set down as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of confession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In every confession <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is laid bare to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and closed to others by the seal of confession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that every definition should include everything connected with the thing defined: and for this reason we find some definitions or descriptions that indicate one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and some that indicate another.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether confession is an act of virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that confession is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For every act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, since "we are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> capable of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 1). But confession does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. Therefore it is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is more befitting one who is innocent than one who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. But the confession of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is the confession of which we are speaking now, cannot be befitting an innocent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore it is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> differs somewhat from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. But confession is part of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore it is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are about acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But confession comes under a precept. Therefore it is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Further, we do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> except by acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But confession is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, for "it opens the gate of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. iv, D, 17). Therefore it seems that it is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 18, 6,7; II-II, 80; II-II, 85, 3; II-II, 109, 3), for an act to belong to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it suffices that it be of such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to imply some <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> belonging to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now, although confession does not include everything that is required for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, yet its very name implies the manifestation of that which a man has on his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>: for thus his lips and heart agree. For if a man professes with his lips what he does not hold in his heart, it is not a confession but a fiction. Now to express in words what one has in one's thoughts is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and, consequently, confession is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing generically, and is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: yet it can be done badly, if it be devoid of other due circumstances.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Natural reason, in a general way, inclines a man to make confession in the proper way, to confess as he ought, what he ought, and when he ought, and in this way confession belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. But it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> to determine the circumstances, when, how, what, and to whom, with regard to the confession of which we are speaking now. Accordingly it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> inclines a man to confession, by means of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, which determines the circumstances, as is the case with all matters belonging to the positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although an innocent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may have the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whose object is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> already committed, he has not the act, so long as he remains innocent. Wherefore the confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, of which confession we are speaking now, is not befitting an innocent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, though it is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Though the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> differs from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, they are not contrary but disparate; hence there is nothing to prevent that which is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as it proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> quickened by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, from being a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, or part of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, in so far as it is ordained as a remedy for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether confession is an act of the virtue of penance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that confession is not an act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance. For an act belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of confession is the hope of pardon, as appears from the definition given above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore it seems that it is an act of hope and not of penance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, shame is a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. But confession arises from shame, as appears in the definition given above (1, Objection 4). Therefore it is an act of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and not of penance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the act of penance leans on Divine mercy. But confession leans rather on Divine wisdom, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is required in it. Therefore it is not an act of penance.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, we are moved to penance by the article of the Creed which is about the Judgment, on account of fear, which is the origin of penance. But we are moved to confession by the article which is about life everlasting, because it arises from hope of pardon. Therefore it is not an act of penance.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that a man shows himself to be what he is. But this is what a man does when he goes to confession. Therefore confession is an act of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is called <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and not of penance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Penance is ordained for the destruction of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now confession is ordained to this also. Therefore it is an act of penance.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It must be observed with regard to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, that when a special reason of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or difficulty is added over and above the object of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, there is need of a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: thus the expenditure of large sums is the object of magnificence, although the ordinary kind of average expenditure and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> belongs to liberality, as appears from Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 1. The same applies to the confession of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which, although it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> absolutely, yet, on account of the additional reason of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, begins to belong to another kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 7) that a confession made in a court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In like manner the confession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> favors in praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, belongs not to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but to religion: and so too the confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in order to receive pardon for them, is not the elicited act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as some say, but of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance. It may, however, be the commanded act of many <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in so far as the act of confession can be directed to the end of many <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Hope is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of confession, not as eliciting but as commanding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In that definition shame is not mentioned as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of confession, since it is more of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to hinder the act of confession, but rather as the joint <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of delivery from punishment (because shame is in itself a punishment), since also the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are the joint <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> with confession, to the same effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By a certain adaptation the parts of Penance can be ascribed to three Personal Attributes, so that <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> may correspond to mercy or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, by reason of its being sorrow for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>--confession to wisdom, by reason of its being a manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>--and satisfaction to power, on account of the labor it entails. And since <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is the first part of Penance, and renders the other parts efficacious, for this reason the same is to be said of Penance as a whole, as of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since confession results from hope rather than from fear, as stated above (1, ad 2), it is based on the article about <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> which hope looks to, rather than on the article about the Judgment, which fear considers; although penance, in its aspect of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, is the opposite.

<p>The Reply to the Fifth Objection is to be gathered from what has been said.
