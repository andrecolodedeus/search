<h1>Question 80. The appetitive powers in general</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1080.htm#article1"> Should the appetite be considered a special power of the soul?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1080.htm#article2"> Should the appetite be divided into intellectual and sensitive as distinct powers?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the appetite is a special power of the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not a special power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For no power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to be assigned for those things which are common to animate and to inanimate things. But <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is common to animate and inanimate things: since "all desire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not a special power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, powers are differentiated by their objects. But what we desire is the same as what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is not distinct from the apprehensive power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the common is not divided from the proper. But each power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> desires some particular desirable thing--namely its own suitable object. Therefore, with regard to this object which is the desirable in general, we should not assign some particular power distinct from the others, called the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> distinguishes (De Anima ii, 3) the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> from the other powers. <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> also (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) distinguishes the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> from the cognitive powers.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to assign an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. To make this evident, we must observe that some inclination follows every form: for example, fire, by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, is inclined to rise, and to generate its like. Now, the form is found to have a more perfect <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in those things which participate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than in those which lack <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For in those which lack <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the form is found to determine each thing only to its own being--that is, to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form is followed by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination, which is called the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But in those things which have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, each one is determined to its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form, in such a manner that it is nevertheless receptive of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of other things: for example, sense receives the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of all things sensible, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, of all things intelligible, so that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is, in a way, all things by sense and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: and thereby, those things that have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in a way, approach to a likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "in Whom all things pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. v).

<p>Therefore, as forms <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in those things that have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in a higher manner and above the manner of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forms; so must there be in them an inclination surpassing the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination, which is called the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. And this superior inclination belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, through which the animal is able to desire what it apprehends, and not only that to which it is inclined by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form. And so it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to assign an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Appetite is found in things which have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, above the common manner in which it is found in all things, as we have said above. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to assign to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a particular power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> What is apprehended and what is desired are the same in reality, but differ in aspect: for a thing is apprehended as something sensible or intelligible, whereas it is desired as suitable or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now, it is diversity of aspect in the objects, and not material diversity, which demands a diversity of powers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Each power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a form or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to something. Wherefore each power desires by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> that object which is suitable to itself. Above which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which follows the apprehension, and by which something is desired not as suitable to this or that power, such as sight for seeing, or sound for hearing; but simply as suitable to the animal.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the sensitive and intellectual appetites are distinct powers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the sensitive and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> appetites are not distinct powers. For powers are not differentiated by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> differences, as we have seen above (Question 77, Article 3). But it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the appetible object whether it be apprehended by the sense or by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the sensitive and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> appetites are not distinct powers.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is of universals; and so it is distinct from sensitive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> things. But there is no place for this distinction in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part: for since the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> things, seemingly every act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> regards an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> thing. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not distinguished from the sensitive.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as under the apprehensive power, the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> is subordinate as a lower power, so also is the motive power. But the motive power which in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> follows the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not distinct from the motive power which in animals follows sense. Therefore, for a like reason, neither is there distinction in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, 9) distinguishes a double <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and says (De Anima iii, 11) that the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> moves the lower.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must needs say that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a distinct power from the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is a passive power, which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> moved by the thing apprehended: wherefore the apprehended appetible is a mover which is not moved, while the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a mover moved, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in De Anima iii, 10 and Metaph. xii (Did. xi, 7). Now things passive and movable are differentiated according to the distinction of the corresponding active and motive principles; because the motive must be proportionate to the movable, and the active to the passive: indeed, the passive power itself has its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from its relation to its active principle. Therefore, since what is apprehended by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and what is apprehended by sense are generically different; consequently, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is distinct from the sensitive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the thing desired to be apprehended by the sense or the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; on the contrary, this belongs to it by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for the appetible does not move the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> except as it is apprehended. Wherefore differences in the thing apprehended are of themselves differences of the appetible. And so the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers are distinct according to the distinction of the things apprehended, as their proper objects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, though it tends to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> things which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, yet tends to them as standing under the universal; as when it desires something because it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhetoric. ii, 4) that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> can regard a universal, as when "we <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> every kind of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>." In the same way by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> we may desire the immaterial <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is not apprehended by sense, such as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and suchlike.
