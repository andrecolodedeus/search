<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the devil is directly the cause of man's sinning?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is directly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists directly in an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 12) that "the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> inspires his friends with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires"; and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, commenting on <a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse3">Acts 5:3</a>, says that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> "draws the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires"; and <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Summo Bono ii, 41; iii, 5) that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> "fills men's hearts with secret lusts." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is directly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Contra Jovin. ii, 2) that "as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the perfecter of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> the perfecter of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is directly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is directly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in a chapter of the Eudemein Ethics (vii, 18): "There must needs be some extrinsic principle of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> counsel." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> counsel is not only about <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things but also about <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, and so is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> moves him to take <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsel, and consequently is directly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> proves (De Lib. Arb. i, 11) that "nothing else than his own will makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> of his desire." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not become a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> to his desires, except through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> own will alone.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sin is an action: so that a thing can be directly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in the same way as anyone is directly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of an action; and this can only happen by moving that action's proper principle to act. Now the proper principle of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> action is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, since every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Consequently nothing can be directly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except that which can move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to act.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (9, A3,4,6), can be moved by two things: first by its object, inasmuch as the apprehended appetible is said to move the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: secondly by that agent which moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> inwardly to will, and this is no other than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> itself, or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was shown above (9, A3,4,6). Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 79, Article 1). Therefore it follows that in this respect, a man's will alone is directly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>As regards the object, a thing may be understood as moving the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in three ways. First, the object itself which is proposed to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: thus we say that food arouses <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> desire to eat. Secondly, he that proposes or offers this object. Thirdly, he that persuades the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that the object proposed has an aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because he also, in a fashion, offers the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> its proper object, which is a real or apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason. Accordingly, in the first way the sensible things, which approach from without, move a man's will to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In the second and third ways, either the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> or a man may incite to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either by offering an object of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to the senses, or by persuading the reason. But in none of these three ways can anything be the direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, moved by any object except the last end, as stated above (10, A1,2). Consequently neither the thing offered from without, nor he that proposes it, nor he that persuades, is the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it follows that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither directly nor sufficiently, but only by persuasion, or by proposing the object of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All these, and other like authorities, if we meet with them, are to be understood as denoting that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> induces <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to affection for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either by suggesting to him, or by offering him objects of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This comparison is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in so far as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is somewhat the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in a certain way the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions, but does not extend to the mode of causation: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in us by moving the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> inwardly, whereas the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> cannot move us in this way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the universal principle of all inward movements of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; but that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will be determined to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsel, is directly due to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, and to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> as persuading or offering the object of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the devil can induce man to sin, by internal instigations?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> cannot induce <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by internal instigations. Because the internal movements of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are vital functions. Now no vital functions can be exercised except by an intrinsic principle, not even those of the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which are the lowest of vital functions. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> cannot instigate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through his internal movements.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all the internal movements arise from the external senses according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone to do anything beside the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as was stated in the I, 110, 4. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> cannot effect anything in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> internal movements, except in respect of things which are perceived by the external senses.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the internal acts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are to understand and to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> can do nothing in connection with either of these, because, as stated in the I, 111, A2,3, ad 2, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> cannot impress <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, nor does it seem possible for him to produce <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, since <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> forms, being more <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, are more excellent than those which are in sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which, nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is unable to produce, as is clear from what we have said in the I, 110, 2; I, 111, A2,3, ad 2. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> cannot through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> internal movements induce him to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In that case, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> would never <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unless he appeared visibly; which is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The interior part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> and sensitive; and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part contains the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. As regards the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, we have already stated (1; I, 111, 1) what is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> relation thereto. Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is moved by that which enlightens it in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has no <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of doing in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> regard; rather does he darken <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason so that it may consent to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which darkness is due to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Consequently the operation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> seems to be confined to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, by moving either of which he can induce <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For his operation may result in presenting certain forms to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>; and he is able to incite the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to some passion or other.

<p>The reason of this is, that as stated in the I, 110, 3, the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to be moved locally by the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: so that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> can produce all those effects which can result from the local movement of bodies here below, except he be restrained by the Divine power. Now the representation of forms to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is due, sometimes, to local movement: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Somno et Vigil.) [De Insomn. iii, iv.] that "when an animal sleeps, the blood descends in abundance to the sensitive principle, and the movements descend with it, viz. the impressions left by the action of sensible objects, which impressions are preserved by means of sensible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and continue to move the apprehensive principle, so that they appear just as though the sensitive principles were being affected by them at the time." Hence such a local movement of the vital spirits or humors can be procured by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sleep or wake: and so it happens that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is brought into play.

<p>In like manner, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is incited to certain <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> according to certain fixed movements of the heart and the vital spirits: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> can cooperate in this also. And through certain <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> being aroused in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, the result is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> more easily perceives the movement or sensible image which is brought in the manner explained, before the apprehensive principle, since, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (De Somno et Virgil.: De Insomn. iii, iv), "lovers are moved, by even a slight likeness, to an apprehension of the beloved." It also happens, through the rousing of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, that what is put before the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, is judged, as being something to be pursued, because, to him who is held by a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, whatever the passion inclines him to, seems <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. In this way the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> induces <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> inwardly to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although vital functions are always from an intrinsic principle, yet an extrinsic agent can cooperate with them, even as external heat cooperates with the functions of the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that food may be more easily digested.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This apparition of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> forms is not altogether outside the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, nor is it due to a command alone, but according to local movement, as explained above.

<p>Consequently the Reply to the Third Objection is clear, because these forms are received originally from the senses.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the devil can induce man to sin of necessity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> can induce <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Because the greater can compel the lesser. Now it is said of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> (<a href="../bible/job041.htm#verse24">Job 41:24</a>) that "there is no power on earth that can compare with him." Therefore he can compel <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, while he dwells on the earth.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason cannot be moved except in respect of things that are offered outwardly to the senses, or are represented to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>: because "all our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> arises from the senses, and we cannot understand without a phantasm" (De Anima iii, text. 30. 39). Now the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> can move <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>); and also the external senses, for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 12) that "this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," of which, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, "extends gradually through all the approaches to the senses, it adapts itself to shapes, blends with colors, mingles with sounds, seasons every flavor." Therefore it can incline <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 4) that "there is some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusteth</a> against the spirit." Now the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh, even as other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, in the way explained above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore he can induce <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1 Peter 5:8</a>): "Your adversary the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour." Now it would be useless to admonish thus, if it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of succumbing to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Therefore he cannot induce <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p>Further, it is likewise written (<a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse7">James 4:7</a>): "Be subject . . . to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but resist the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and he will fly from you," which would be said neither rightly nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> were able to compel us, in any way whatever, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for then neither would it be possible to resist him, nor would he fly from those who do. Therefore he does not compel to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, by his own power, unless he be restrained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can compel anyone to do an act which, in its genus, is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but he cannot bring about the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. This is evident from the fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not resist that which moves him to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; the use of which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is able to impede altogether, by moving the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; as is the case with one who is possessed. But then, the reason being thus fettered, whatever <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may do, it is not imputed to him as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If, however, the reason is not altogether fettered, then, in so far as it is free, it can resist <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 77, Article 7). It is consequently evident that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> can nowise compel <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not every power that is greater than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, can move <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can do this, as stated above (Question 9, Article 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That which is apprehended by the senses or the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> does not move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, so long as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; nor does such an apprehension always fetter the reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The lusting of the flesh against the spirit, when the reason actually resists it, is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for the exercise of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. That reason does not resist, is not in the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power; wherefore he cannot bring about the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether all the sins of men are due to the devil's suggestion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are due to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> suggestion. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that the "crowd of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, both to themselves and to others."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally, becomes the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John 8:34</a>: "Whosoever committeth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'servant'] of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Now "by whom a man is overcome, of the same also he is the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>" (<a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse19">2 Peter 2:19</a>). Therefore whoever commits a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, has been overcome by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. iv, 10) the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is irreparable, because he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> at no other's suggestion. Therefore, if any men were to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> and without suggestion from any other, their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would be irremediable: which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are due to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> suggestion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (De Eccl. Dogm. lxxxii): "Not all our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts are incited by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; sometimes they are due to a movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the occasional and indirect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in so far as he induced the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by reason of whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is so infected, that we are all prone to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: even as the burning of wood might be imputed to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who dried the wood so as to make it easily inflammable. He is not, however, the direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as though each were the result of his suggestion. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> proves this (Peri Archon iii, 2) from the fact that even if the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> were no more, men would still have the desire for food, sexual pleasures and the like; which desire might be inordinate, unless it were subordinate to reason, a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> that is subject to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The crowd of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, as regards their original <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes another's <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> not only by being overcome by him, but also by subjecting himself to him spontaneously: it is thus that one who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his own accord, becomes the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was irremediable, not only because he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> without another's suggestion; but also because he was not already prone to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, on account of any previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; which can be said of no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.
