<h1>Question 80. The potential parts of Justice</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3080.htm#article1"> What virtues are annexed to justice?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the virtues annexed to justice are suitably enumerated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> are unsuitably enumerated Tully [De Invent. ii, 53 reckons six, viz. "religion, piety, gratitude, revenge, observance, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now revenge is seemingly a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> whereby revenge is taken for injuries inflicted, as stated above (Question 61, Article 4). Therefore it should not be reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Macrobius (Super Somn. Scip. i, 8) reckons seven, viz. "innocence, friendship, concord, piety, religion, affection, humanity," several of which are omitted by Tully. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> would seem to be insufficiently enumerated.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, others reckon five parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, viz. "obedience" in respect of one's superiors, "discipline" with regard to inferiors, "equity" as regards equals, "fidelity" and "truthfulness" towards all; and of these "truthfulness" alone is mentioned by Tully. Therefore he would seem to have enumerated insufficiently the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the peripatetic Andronicus [De Affectibus] reckons nine parts annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> viz. "liberality, kindliness, revenge, commonsense, [<em>eugnomosyne</em>] piety, gratitude, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, just exchange" and "just lawgiving"; and of all these it is evident that Tully mentions none but "revenge." Therefore he would appear to have made an incomplete enumeration.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Ethic. v, 10) mentions <em>epieikeia</em> as being annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and yet seemingly it is not included in any of the foregoing enumerations. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> are insufficiently enumerated.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two points must be observed about the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> annexed to a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The first is that these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have something in common with the principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and the second is that in some respect they fall short of the perfection of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Accordingly since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to another as stated above (Question 58, Article 2), all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that are directed to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may by reason of this common aspect be annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> character of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in rendering to another his due according to equality, as stated above (Question 58, Article 11). Wherefore in two ways may a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> directed to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> fall short of the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: first, by falling short of the aspect of equality; secondly, by falling short of the aspect of due. For certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> there are which render another his due, but are unable to render the equal due. On the first place, whatever <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> renders to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is due, yet it cannot be equal, as though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rendered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as much as he owes Him, according to <a href="../bible/psa115.htm#verse12">Psalm 115:12</a>, "What shall I render to the Lord for all the things that He hath rendered to me?" On this respect "religion" is annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> since, according to Tully (De invent. ii, 53), it consists in offering service and ceremonial rites or worship to "some superior <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that men call divine." Secondly, it is not possible to make to one's parents an equal return of what one owes to them, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. viii, 14); and thus "piety" is annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, for thereby, as Tully says (De invent. ii, 53), a man "renders service and constant deference to his kindred and the well-wishers of his country." Thirdly, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 3), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is unable to offer an equal meed for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and thus "observance" is annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, consisting according to Tully (De invent. ii, 53) in the "deference and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> rendered to those who excel in worth."

<p>A falling short of the just due may be considered in respect of a twofold due, moral or legal: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 13) assigns a corresponding twofold just. The legal due is that which one is bound to render by reason of a legal <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>; and this due is chiefly the concern of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is the principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On the other hand, the moral due is that to which one is bound in respect of the rectitude of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and since a due implies <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, this kind of due has two degrees. For one due is so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that without it moral rectitude cannot be ensured: and this has more of the character of due. Moreover this due may be considered from the point of view of the debtor, and in this way it pertains to this kind of due that a man represent himself to others just as he is, both in word and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Wherefore to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is annexed "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," whereby, as Tully says (De invent. ii, 53), present, past and future things are told without perversion. It may also be considered from the point of view of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom it is due, by comparing the reward he receives with what he has done--sometimes in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; and then annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> we have "gratitude" which "consists in recollecting the friendship and kindliness shown by others, and in desiring to pay them back," as Tully states (De invent. ii, 53)--and sometimes in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, and then to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is annexed "revenge," whereby, as Tully states (De invent. ii, 53), "we resist force, injury or anything obscure* by taking vengeance or by self-defense." [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> read 'obscurum,' and explains it as meaning 'derogatory,' infra108, 2. Cicero, however, wrote 'obfuturum,' i.e. 'hurtful.']

<p>There is another due that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the sense that it conduces to greater rectitude, although without it rectitude may be ensured. This due is the concern of "liberality," "affability" or "friendship," or the like, all of which Tully omits in the aforesaid enumeration because there is little of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of anything due in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The revenge taken by authority of a public power, in accordance with a judge's sentence, belongs to commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: whereas the revenge which a man takes on his own initiative, though not against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, or which a man seeks to obtain from a judge, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Macrobius appears to have considered the two integral parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, namely, "declining from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," to which "innocence" belongs, and "doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," to which the six others belong. Of these, two would seem to regard relations between equals, namely, "friendship" in the external conduct and "concord" internally; two regard our relations toward superiors, namely, "piety" to parents, and "religion" to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; while two regard our relations towards inferiors, namely, "condescension," in so far as their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pleases us, and "humanity," whereby we help them in their needs. For <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x) that a man is said to be "humane, through having a feeling of love and pity towards men: this gives its name to humanity whereby we uphold one another." On this sense "friendship" is understood as directing our external conduct towards others, from which point of view the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> treats of it in Ethic. iv, 6. "Friendship" may also be taken as regarding properly the affections, and as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> describes it in Ethic. viii and ix. On this sense three things pertain to friendship, namely, "benevolence" which is here called "affection"; "concord," and "beneficence" which is here called "humanity." These three, however, are omitted by Tully, because, as stated above, they have little of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a due.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> "Obedience" is included in observance, which Tully mentions, because both reverential <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and obedience are due to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who excel. "Faithfulness whereby a man's acts agree with his words" [Cicero, De Repub. iv, De Offic. i, 7, is contained in "truthfulness" as to the observance of one's promises: yet "truthfulness" covers a wider ground, as we shall state further on (109, 1 and 3). "Discipline" is not due as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, because one is under no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to an inferior as such, although a superior may be under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to watch over his inferiors, according to <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse45">Matthew 24:45</a>, "A faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath appointed over his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>": and for this reason it is omitted by Tully. It may, however, be included in humanity mentioned by Macrobius; and equity under <em>epieikeia</em> or under "friendship."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This enumeration contains some belonging to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. To particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> belongs "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of exchange," which he describes as "the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of observing equality in commutations." To legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as regards things to be observed by all, he ascribes "legislative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," which he describes as "the science of political commutations relating to the community." As regards things which have to be done in particular cases beside the general laws, he mentions "<a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a>" or "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judgment*," which is our guide in such like matters, as stated above (Question 51, Article 4) in the treatise on <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>: wherefore he says that it is a "<a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>," because by his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> observes what is just according to his judgment and not according to the written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> indicates the Greek derivation: <em>eugnomosyne</em> quasi 'bona <em>gnome</em>.'] These two are ascribed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> as their director, and to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> as their executor. <em>Eusebeia</em> [piety] means "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> worship" and consequently is the same as religion, wherefore he says that it is the science of "the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (he speaks after the manner of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> who said that 'all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>') [<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Ethic. vi, 13: and "<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>" comes to the same, as we shall state further on (81, 8). <em>Eucharistia</em> (gratitude) means "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thanksgiving," and is mentioned by Macrobius: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x) that "a kind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who is ready of his own accord to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and is of gentle speech": and Andronicus too says that "kindliness is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> beneficence." "Liberality" would seem to pertain to "humanity."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <em>Epieikeia</em> is annexed, not to particular but to legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and apparently is the same as that which goes by the name of <em>eugnomosyne</em> [<a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a>].
