<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there are two ways to be distinguished of eating Christ's body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that two ways ought not to be distinguished of eating <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, namely, sacramentally and spiritually. For, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>: "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," etc., so also this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food: hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, speaking of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, says (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse64">John 6:64</a>): "The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life." But there are no two distinct ways of receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, namely, sacramentally and spiritually. Therefore neither ought this distinction to be made regarding this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, when two things are so related that one is on account of the other, they should not be put in contra-distinction to one another, because the one derives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the other. But sacramental eating is ordained for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating as its end. Therefore sacramental eating ought not to be divided in contrast with <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things which cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without one another ought not to be divided in contrast with each other. But it seems that no one can eat spiritually without eating sacramentally; otherwise the fathers of old would have eaten this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> spiritually. Moreover, sacramental eating would be to no purpose, if the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating could be had without it. Therefore it is not right to distinguish a twofold eating, namely, sacramental and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse29">1 Corinthians 11:29</a>: "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily," etc.: "We hold that there are two ways of eating, the one sacramental, and the other <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two things to be considered in the receiving of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, namely, the sacrament itself, and its fruits, and we have already spoken of both (Q73,79). The perfect way, then, of receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is when one takes it so as to partake of its effect. Now, as was stated above (79, 3,8), it sometimes happens that a man is hindered from receiving the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; and such receiving of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is an imperfect one. Therefore, as the perfect is divided against the imperfect, so sacramental eating, whereby the sacrament only is received without its effect, is divided against <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating, by which one receives the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, whereby a man is spiritually united with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The same distinction is made regarding <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: for, some receive the sacrament only, while others receive the sacrament and the reality of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. However, there is a difference, because, since the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are accomplished in the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the receiving of the sacrament is the actual perfection of the sacrament; whereas this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is accomplished in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: and consequently both uses follow the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. On the other hand, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> that imprint a character, they who receive the sacrament receive some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect, that is, the character. which is not the case in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And therefore, in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, rather than in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, the sacramental use is distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> use.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That sacramental eating which is also a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating is not divided in contrast with <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating, but is included under it; but that sacramental eating which does not secure the effect, is divided in contrast with <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating; just as the imperfect, which does not attain the perfection of its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is divided in contrast with the perfect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 73, Article 3), the effect of the sacrament can be secured by every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> if he receive it in desire, though not in reality. Consequently, just as some are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of desire, through their desire of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, before being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of water; so likewise some eat this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> spiritually ere they receive it sacramentally. Now this happens in two ways. First of all, from desire of receiving the sacrament itself, and thus are said to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and to eat spiritually, and not sacramentally, they who desire to receive these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> since they have been instituted. Secondly, by a figure: thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 10:2</a>), that the fathers of old were "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the cloud and in the sea," and that "they did eat . . . <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food, and . . . drank . . . <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> drink." Nevertheless sacramental eating is not without avail, because the actual receiving of the sacrament produces more fully the effect of the sacrament than does the desire thereof, as stated above of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (69, 4, ad 2).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it belongs to man alone to eat this sacrament spiritually?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it does not belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> alone to eat this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> spiritually, but likewise to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Because on <a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse25">Psalm 77:25</a>: "Man ate the bread of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "that is, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the food of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." But it would not be so unless the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were to eat <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spiritually. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> eat <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spiritually.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. xxvi in Joan.) says: By "this meat and drink, He would have us to understand the fellowship of His body and members, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in His <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> ones." But not only men, but also the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> belong to that fellowship. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> eat of it spiritually.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in his book De Verbis Domini (Serm. cxlii) says: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is to be eaten spiritually, as He Himself declares: 'He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood, abideth in Me, and I in him.'" But this belongs not only to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but also to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> dwells by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and they in Him. Consequently, it seems that to eat <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spiritually is not for men only, but also for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. xxvi in Joan.) says: "Eat the bread" of the altar "spiritually; take innocence to the altar." But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not approach the altar as for the purpose of taking something therefrom. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not eat spiritually.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself is contained in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not under His proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Consequently there are two ways of eating spiritually. First, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> under His proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and in this way the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> eat <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spiritually inasmuch as they are united with Him in the enjoyment of perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and in clear vision (and this is the bread we hope for in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>), and not by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as we are united with Him here.

<p>In another way one may eat <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spiritually, as He is under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, inasmuch as a man <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while desiring to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; and this is not merely to eat <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spiritually, but likewise to eat this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; which does not fall to the lot of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And therefore although the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> feed on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spiritually, yet it does not belong to them to eat this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> spiritually.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The receiving of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is ordained to the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as to its end, in the same way as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> enjoy it; and since the means are gauged by the end, hence it is that such eating of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> whereby we receive Him under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, is, as it were, derived from that eating whereby the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> enjoy <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to eat the "bread of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>," because it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to do so firstly and principally, since they enjoy Him in his proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and secondly it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Both men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> belong to the fellowship of His <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a>; men by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by manifest vision. But the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are proportioned to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, through which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is seen "through a glass" and "in a dark manner." And therefore, properly speaking, it does not belong to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to eat this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> spiritually.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> dwells in men through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to their present state, but He is in the blessed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by manifest vision. Consequently the comparison does not hold, as stated above (ad 2).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the just man alone may eat Christ sacramentally?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that none but the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may eat <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> sacramentally. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book De Remedio Penitentiae (cf. Tract. in Joan. xxv, n. 12; xxvi, n. 1): "Why make ready tooth and belly? Believe, and thou hast eaten . . . For to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, this it is, to eat the living bread." But the sinner does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him; because he has not living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to which it belongs to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> "in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as stated above in the II-II, 2, 2; SS, 4, 5. Therefore the sinner cannot eat this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which is the living bread.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is specially called "the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," as stated above (78, 3, ad 6). But as unbelievers lack <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so all sinners lack <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now unbelievers do not seem to be capable of eating this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, since in the sacramental form it is called the "Mystery of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>." Therefore, for like reason, the sinner cannot eat <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body sacramentally.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the sinner is more abominable before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than the irrational creature: for it is said of the sinner (<a href="../bible/psa048.htm#verse21">Psalm 48:21</a>): "Man when he was in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> did not understand; he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them." But an irrational animal, such as a mouse or a dog, cannot receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, just as it cannot receive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>. Therefore it seems that for the like reason neither may sinners eat this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. xxvi in Joan.), commenting on the words, "that if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> eat of it he may not die," says: "Many receive from the altar, and by receiving die: whence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> saith, 'eateth and drinketh judgment to himself.'" But only sinners die by receiving. Therefore sinners eat the body of Christ sacramentally, and not the just only.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the past, some have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> upon this point, saying that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not received sacramentally by sinners; but that directly the body is touched by the lips of sinners, it ceases to be under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>But this is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>; because it detracts from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it belongs that so long as the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> last, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body does not cease to be under them, as stated above (76, 6, ad 3; 77, 8). But the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> last so long as the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread would remain, if it were there, as was stated above (Question 77, Article 4). Now it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread taken by a sinner does not at once cease to be, but it continues until digested by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat: hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body remains just as long under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> when taken by sinners. Hence it must be said that the sinner, and not merely the just, can eat <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Such words and similar expressions are to be understood of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating, which does not belong to sinners. Consequently, it is from such expressions being misunderstood that the above <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> seems to have arisen, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the distinction between corporeal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Should even an unbeliever receive the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, he would receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body under the sacrament: hence he would eat Christ sacramentally, if the word "sacramentally" qualify the verb on the part of the thing eaten. But if it qualify the verb on the part of the one eating, then, properly speaking, he does not eat sacramentally, because he uses what he takes, not as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but as simple food. Unless perchance the unbeliever were to intend to receive what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> bestows; without having proper <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> regarding the other articles, or regarding this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even though a mouse or a dog were to eat the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> host, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body would not cease to be under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, so long as those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> remain, and that is, so long as the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of bread would have remained; just as if it were to be cast into the mire. Nor does this turn to any indignity regarding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, since He willed to be crucified by sinners without detracting from His dignity; especially since the mouse or dog does not touch <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body in its proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but only as to its sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Some, however, have said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body would cease to be there, directly it were touched by a mouse or a dog; but this again detracts from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above. None the less it must not be said that the irrational animal eats the body of Christ sacramentally; since it is incapable of using it as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Hence it eats <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body "<a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>," and not sacramentally, just as if anyone not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> a host to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> were to consume it. And since no genus is divided by an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> difference, therefore this manner of eating <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not set down as a third way besides sacramental and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the sinner sins in receiving Christ's body sacramentally?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the sinner does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in receiving <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body sacramentally, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has no greater dignity under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> than under His own. But sinners did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when they touched <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body under its proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; nay, rather they obtained forgiveness of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as we read in <a href="../bible/luk007.htm">Luke 7</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was a sinner; while it is written (<a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse36">Matthew 14:36</a>) that "as many as touched the hem of His garment were healed." Therefore, they do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but rather obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, by receiving the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, like the others, is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> medicine. But medicine is given to the sick for their recovery, according to <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew 9:12</a>: "They that are in health need not a physician." Now they that are spiritually sick or infirm are sinners. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can be received by them without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is one of our greatest <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, since it contains <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Lib. Arb. ii), the greatest <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are those "which no one can abuse." Now no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> except by abusing something. Therefore no sinner <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is perceived by taste and touch, so also is it by sight. Consequently, if the sinner <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it seems that he would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by beholding it, which is manifestly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> exposes this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to be seen and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> by all. Therefore the sinner does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by eating this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it happens sometimes that the sinner is unconscious of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet such a one does not seem to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by receiving the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for according to this all who receive it would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as exposing themselves to danger, since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>): "I am not conscious to myself of anything, yet I am not hereby justified." Therefore, the sinner, if he receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, does not appear to be guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse29">1 Corinthians 11:29</a>): "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself." Now the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on this passage: "He eats and drinks unworthily who is in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or who handles it irreverently." Therefore, if anyone, while in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, receives this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, he purchases damnation, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> mortally.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as in the others, that which is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a sign of the reality of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now there is a twofold reality of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (Question 73, Article 6): one which is signified and contained, namely, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself; while the other is signified but not contained, namely, <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Christ's mystical body</a>, which is the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Therefore, whoever receives this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, expresses thereby that he is made one with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and incorporated in His members; and this is done by living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which no one has who is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And therefore it is manifest that whoever receives this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> while in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is guilty of lying to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and consequently of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, because he profanes the sacrament: and therefore he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared under His proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, He did not give Himself to be touched by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as a sign of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> union with Himself, as He gives Himself to be received in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And therefore sinners in touching Him under His proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> did not incur the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of lying to Godlike things, as sinners do in receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>Furthermore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> still bore the likeness of the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; consequently He fittingly allowed Himself to be touched by sinners. But as soon as the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was taken away by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, he forbade the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to touch Him, for her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him was defective, according to <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John 20:17</a>: "Do not touch Me, for I am not yet <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> to My Father," i.e. "in your heart," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> explains (Tract. cxxi in Joan.). And therefore sinners, who lack living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> regarding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are not allowed to touch this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Every medicine does not suit every stage of sickness; because the tonic given to those who are recovering from fever would be hurtful to them if given while yet in their feverish condition. So likewise <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and Penance are as purgative medicines, given to take away the fever of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; whereas this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a medicine given to strengthen, and it ought not to be given except to them who are quit of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By the greatest <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> understands the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, "which no one uses to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> purpose," as though they were principles of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Nevertheless sometimes a man makes a bad use of them, as objects of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use, as is seen in those who are <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. So likewise this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, so far as the sacrament is concerned, is not the principle of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use, but the object thereof. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxii in Joan.): "Many receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body unworthily; whence we are taught what need there is to beware of receiving a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evilly</a> . . . For behold, of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing, received <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evilly</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is wrought": just as on the other hand, in the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> case, "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> was wrought through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> well received," namely, by bearing patiently the sting of Satan.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not received by being seen, but only its sacrament, because sight does not penetrate to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, but only to the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (Question 76, Article 7). But he who eats, receives not only the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but likewise <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself Who is under them. Consequently, no one is forbidden to behold <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, when once he has received Christ's sacrament, namely, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: whereas the non-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are not to be allowed even to see this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. vii). But only those are to be allowed to share in the eating who are united with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> not merely sacramentally, but likewise really.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The fact of a man being unconscious of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can come about in two ways. First of all through his own fault, either because through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (which <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not excuse him), he thinks something not to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> which is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as for example if one guilty of fornication were to deem simple fornication not to be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; or because he neglects to examine his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, which is opposed to what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 11:28</a>): "Let a man <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>." And in this way nevertheless the sinner who receives <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although unconscious thereof, because the very <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on his part.

<p>Secondly, it may happen without fault on his part, as, for instance, when he has sorrowed over his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is not sufficiently <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a>: and in such a case he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in receiving the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because a man cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain whether he is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a>. It suffices, however, if he find in himself the marks of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, for instance, if he "grieve over past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," and "propose to avoid them in the future" [Cf. Rule of Augustine]. But if he be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that what he did was a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the fact, which excuses, for instance, if a man approach a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be his wife whereas she was not, he is not to be called a sinner on that account; in the same way if he has utterly forgotten his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, general <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> suffices for blotting it out, as will be said hereafter (XP, 2, 3, ad 2); hence he is no longer to be called a sinner.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether to approach this sacrament with consciousness of sin is the gravest of all sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that to approach this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> with consciousness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the gravest of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; because the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse27">1 Corinthians 11:27</a>): "Whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord": upon which the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes: "He shall be punished as though he slew <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of them who slew Christ seems to have been most grave. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereby a man approaches <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> table with consciousness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, appears to be the gravest.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in an Epistle (xlix): "What hast thou to do with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, thou that speakest familiarly with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at the altar?" [The remaining part of the quotation is not from <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>]. Say, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, say, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, how dost thou kiss the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with the same lips wherewith thou hast kissed the daughter of a harlot? "<a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, thou betrayest the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> with a kiss!" And thus it appears that the fornicator approaching <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> table <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> did, whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was most grave. But there are many other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are graver than fornication, especially the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of every sinner approaching <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> table is the gravest of all.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> is more abominable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than corporeal. But if anyone was to cast <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body into mud or a cess-pool, his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would be reputed a most grave one. Therefore, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more deeply by receiving it with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, upon his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on the words, "If I had not come, and had not spoken to them, they would be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (Tract. lxxxix in Joan.), that this is to be understood of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief, "in which all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are comprised," and so the greatest of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> appears to be, not this, but rather the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in I-II, 73, 3,6; II-II, 73, 3, one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be said to be graver than another in two ways: first of all <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, secondly <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Essentially, in regard to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which is taken from its object: and so a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is greater according as that against which it is committed is greater. And since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead is greater than His humanity, and His humanity greater than the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of His humanity, hence it is that those are the gravest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are committed against the Godhead, such as unbelief and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. The second degree of gravity is held by those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are committed against His humanity: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew 12:32</a>): "Whosoever shall speak a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, it shall be forgiven him; but he that shall speak against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the world to come." In the third place come <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed against the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity; and after these are the other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed against mere creatures.

<p>Accidentally, one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be graver than another on the sinner's part. for example, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is the result of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or of weakness is lighter than one arising from contempt, or from sure <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and the same reason holds good of other circumstances. And according to this, the above <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be graver in some, as happens in them who from actual contempt and with consciousness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> approach this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: but in others it is less grave; for instance, in those who from fear of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being discovered, approach this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> with consciousness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>So, then, it is evident that this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is specifically graver than many others, yet it is not the greatest of all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the unworthy recipient is compared to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of them who slew Christ, by way of similitude, because each is committed against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body; but not according to the degree of the crime. Because the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> slayers was much graver, first of all, because their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body in its own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, while this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is against it under sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; secondly, because their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> came of the intent of injuring <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while this does not.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the fornicator receiving <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is likened to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> Christ, as to the resemblance of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because each outrages <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the sign of friendship. but not as to the extent of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as was observed above (ad 1). And this resemblance in crime applies no less to other sinners than to fornicators: because by other mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, sinners act against the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of which this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is the sign, and all the more according as their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are graver. But in a measure the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of fornication makes one more unfit for receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because thereby especially the spirit becomes enslaved by the flesh, which is a hindrance to the fervor of love required for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>However, the hindrance to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> itself weighs more than the hindrance to its fervor. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief, which fundamentally severs a man from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, simply speaking, makes him to be utterly unfit for receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; because it is the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> unity, as stated above (Question 61, Article 2). Hence the unbeliever who receives this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously than the believer who is in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and shows greater contempt towards <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who is in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, especially if he does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; because, so far as lies in him, he lessens the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and the power of Christ acting in it, and this is to despise the sacrament in itself. But the believer who receives the sacrament with consciousness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by receiving it unworthily despises the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not in itself, but in its use. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse29">1 Corinthians 11:29</a>) in assigning the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, says, "not discerning the body of the Lord," that is, not distinguishing it from other food: and this is what he does who disbelieves <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> presence in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who would throw this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> into the mire would be guilty of more heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than another approaching the sacrament fully conscious of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. First of all, because he would intend to outrage the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, whereas the sinner receiving <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body unworthily has no such intent; secondly, because the sinner is capable of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; hence he is more capable of receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> than any irrational creature. Hence he would make a most revolting use of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> who would throw it to dogs to eat, or fling it in the mire to be trodden upon.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the priest ought to deny the body of Christ to the sinner seeking it?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should deny the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the sinner seeking it. For Christ's precept is not to be set aside for the sake of avoiding <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> or on account of infamy to anyone. But (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew 7:6</a>) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> gave this command: "Give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to dogs." Now it is especially casting <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things to dogs to give this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to sinners. Therefore, neither on account of avoiding <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> or infamy should this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> be administered to the sinner who asks for it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one must choose the lesser of two <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. But it seems to be the lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> if the sinner incur <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>; or if an unconsecrated host be given to him; than for him to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally by receiving the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consequently, it seems that the course to be adopted is either that the sinner seeking the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be exposed to infamy, or that an unconsecrated host be given to him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is sometimes given to those suspected of crime in order to put them to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. Because we read in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>: "It often happens that thefts are perpetrated in monasteries of monks; wherefore we command that when the brethren have to exonerate themselves of such acts, that the abbot shall celebrate Mass, or someone else deputed by him, in the presence of the community; and so, when the Mass is over, all shall communicate under these words: 'May the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> thee today.'" And further on: "If any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> be imputed to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, for each charge he must say Mass and communicate, and show that he is innocent of each act imputed." But secret sinners must not be disclosed, for, once the blush of shame is set aside, they will indulge the more in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verbis. Dom.; cf. Serm. lxxxii). Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not to be given to occult sinners, even if they ask for it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> on <a href="../bible/psa021.htm#verse30">Psalm 21:30</a>: "All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>," <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says: "Let not the dispenser hinder the fat ones of the earth," i.e. sinners, "from eating at the table of the Lord."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A distinction must be made among sinners: some are secret; others are <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a>, either from evidence of the fact, as public usurers, or public robbers, or from being denounced as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men by some ecclesiastical or civil tribunal. Therefore Holy Communion ought not to be given to open sinners when they ask for it. Hence <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> writes to someone (Ep. lxi): "You were so kind as to consider that I ought to be consulted regarding actors, end that magician who continues to practice his disgraceful arts among you; as to whether I thought that Holy Communion ought to be given to such with the other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. I think that it is beseeming neither the Divine majesty, nor <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> discipline, for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> modesty and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to be defiled by such shameful and infamous contagion."

<p>But if they be not open sinners, but occult, the Holy Communion should not be denied them if they ask for it. For since every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, from the fact that he is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, is admitted to the Lord's table, he may not be robbed of his right, except from some open <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence on <a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>, "If he who is called a brother among you," etc., <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> remarks: "We cannot inhibit any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from Communion, except he has openly confessed, or has been named and convicted by some ecclesiastical or lay tribunal." Nevertheless a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the crime can privately warn the secret sinner, or warn all openly in public, from approaching the Lord's table, until they have repented of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and have been reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; because after repentance and reconciliation, Communion must not be refused even to public sinners, especially in the hour of death. Hence in the (3rd) Council of Carthage (Can. xxxv) we read: "Reconciliation is not to be denied to stage-players or actors, or others of the sort, or to apostates, after their conversion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Holy things are forbidden to be given to dogs, that is, to <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> sinners: whereas hidden <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> may not be published, but are to be left to the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although it is worse for the secret sinner to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally in taking the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, rather than be defamed, nevertheless for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> administering the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> it is worse to commit mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> defaming the hidden sinner than that the sinner should <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally; because no one ought to commit mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in order to keep another out of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qu&aelig;st. super Gen. 42): "It is a most dangerous exchange, for us to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lest another perpetrate a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." But the secret sinner ought rather to prefer infamy than approach the Lord's table unworthily.

<p>Yet by no means should an unconsecrated host be given in place of a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> one; because the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by so doing, so far as he is concerned, makes others, either the bystanders or the communicant, commit <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that it is a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> host; because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/psa098.htm#verse5">Psalm 98:5</a>: "Let no one eat <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh, except he first <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> it." Hence in the Decretals (Extra, De Celeb. Miss., Ch. De Homine) it is said: "Although he who reputes himself unworthy of the Sacrament, through consciousness of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> gravely, if he receive; still he seems to offend more deeply who deceitfully has presumed to simulate it."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those decrees were abolished by contrary enactments of Roman Pontiffs: because Pope Stephen V writes as follows: "The Sacred Canons do not allow of a confession being extorted from any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by trial made by burning iron or boiling water; it belongs to our government to judge of public crimes committed, and that by means of confession made spontaneously, or by <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>: but private and unknown crimes are to be left to Him Who alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the hearts of the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." And the same is found in the Decretals (Extra, De Purgationibus, Ch. Ex tuarum). Because in all such practices there seems to be a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; hence such things cannot be done without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And it would seem graver still if anyone were to incur judgment of death through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which was instituted as a means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Consequently, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should never be given to anyone suspected of crime, as by way of examination.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the seminal loss that occurs during sleep hinders anyone from receiving this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that seminal loss does not hinder anyone from receiving the body of Christ: because no one is prevented from receiving the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> except on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But seminal loss happens without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii) that "the same image that comes into the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of a speaker may present itself to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the sleeper, so that the latter be unable to distinguish the image from the reality, and is moved carnally and with the result that usually follows such motions; and there is as little <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in this as there is in speaking and therefore thinking about such things." Consequently these motions do not prevent one from receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a Letter to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the English (Regist. xi): "Those who pay the debt of marriage not from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, but from desire to have children, should be left to their own judgment, as to whether they should enter the church and receive the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> body, after such intercourse: because they ought not to be forbidden from receiving it, since they have passed through the fire unscorched."

<p>From this it is evident that seminal loss even of one awake, if it be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is no hindrance to receiving the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consequently, much less is it in the case of one asleep.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, these movements of the flesh seem to bring with them only bodily <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>. But there are other bodily defilements which according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> forbade entrance into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, yet which under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> do not prevent receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: as, for instance, in the case of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> after child-birth, or in her periods, or suffering from issue of blood, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> writes to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the English (Regist. xi). Therefore it seems that neither do these movements of the flesh hinder a man from receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is no hindrance to receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, nor is mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after repentance. But even supposing that seminal loss arises from some foregoing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whether of intemperance, or of bad thoughts, for the most part such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is venial; and if occasionally it be mortal, a man may repent of it by morning and confess it. Consequently, it seems that he ought not to be prevented from receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the Fifth Commandment is greater than a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the Sixth. But if a man dream that he has broken the Fifth or Seventh or any other Commandment, he is not on that account debarred from receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore it seems that much less should he be debarred through defilement resulting from a dream against the Sixth Commandment.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/lev015.htm#verse16">Leviticus 15:16</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from whom the seed of copulation goeth out . . . shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> until evening." But for the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> there is no approaching to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Therefore, it seems that owing to such defilement of the flesh a man is debarred from taking this which is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two things to be weighed regarding the aforesaid movements: one on account of which they <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> prevent a man from receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; the other, on account of which they do so, not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, but from a sense of propriety.

<p>Mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> prevents anyone from partaking of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: and although these movements during sleep, considered in themselves, cannot be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nevertheless, owing to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, they have mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> connected with them; which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, therefore, must be investigated. Sometimes they are due to an external <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, viz. the deception of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who can stir up phantasms, as was stated in I, 111, 3, through the apparition of which, these movements occasionally follow. Sometimes they are due to an internal <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, such as previous thoughts. At other times they arise from some internal corporeal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as from abundance or weakness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or even from surfeit of meat or drink. Now every one of these three <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all, or else with venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If it be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or with venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> prevent the receiving of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, so as to make a man guilty of the body and blood of the Lord: but should it be with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it prevents it of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p>For such illusions on the part of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> sometimes come from one's not striving to receive <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">fervently</a>; and this can be either a mortal or a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. At other times it is due to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> alone on the part of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who wish to keep men from receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. So we read in the Conferences of the Fathers (Cassian, Collat. xxii) that when a certain one always suffered thus on those <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast-days</a> on which he had to receive Communion, his superiors, discovering that there was no fault on his part, ruled that he was not to refrain from communicating on that account, and the demoniacal illusion ceased.

<p>In like fashion previous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts can sometimes be without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever, as when one has to think of such things on account of lecturing or debating; and if it be done without <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and delectation, the thoughts will not be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> but honest; and yet defilement can come of such thoughts, as is clear from the authority of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Objection 1). At other times such thoughts come of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and delectation, and should there be consent, it will be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: otherwise it will be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>In the same way too the corporeal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as when it arises from bodily debility, and hence some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> suffer seminal loss without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> even in their wakeful hours; or it can come from the abundance of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: for, just as blood can flow without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so also can the semen which is superfluity of the blood, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Gener. Animal. i). But occasionally it is with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as when it is due to excess of food or drink. And this also can be either venial or mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; although more frequently the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is mortal in the case of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts on account of the proneness to consent, rather than in the case of consumption of food and drink. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, writing to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the English (Regist. xi), says that one ought to refrain from Communion when this arises from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts, but not when it arises from excess of food or drink, especially if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> call for Communion. So, then, one must judge from its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whether such bodily defilement of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> hinders the receiving of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>At the same time a sense of decency forbids Communion on two accounts. The first of these is always verified, viz. the bodily defilement, with which, out of reverence for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it is unbecoming to approach the altar (and hence those who wish to touch any sacred object, wash their hands): except perchance such <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> be perpetual or of long standing, such as <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> or issue of blood, or anything else of the kind. The other reason is the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> distraction which follows after the aforesaid movements, especially when they take place with <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> imaginings. Now this obstacle, which arises from a sense of decency, can be set aside owing to any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Regist. xi): "As when perchance either a festival day calls for it, or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> compels one to exercise the ministry because there is no other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at hand."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is hindered <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, only by mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, from receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: but from a sense of decency one may be hindered through other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Conjugal intercourse, if it be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, (for instance, if it be done for the sake of begetting offspring, or of paying the marriage debt), does not prevent the receiving of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> for any other reason than do those movements in question which happen without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above; namely, on account of the defilement to the body and distraction to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. On this account <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> expresses himself in the following terms in his commentary on Matthew (Epist. xxviii, among <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> works): "If the loaves of Proposition might not be eaten by them who had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> their wives carnally, how much less may this bread which has come down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> be defiled and touched by them who shortly before have been in conjugal embraces? It is not that we condemn marriages, but that at the time when we are going to eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>, we ought not to indulge in carnal acts." But since this is to be understood in the sense of decency, and not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says that such a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> "is to be left to his own judgment." "But if," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Regist. xi), "it be not desire of begetting offspring, but <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> that prevails," then such a one should be forbidden to approach this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in his Letter quoted above to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the English, in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were termed polluted figuratively, which the people of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> understand spiritually. Hence such bodily uncleannesses, if perpetual or of long standing, do not hinder the receiving of this saving sacrament, as they prevented approaching those figurative <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; but if they pass speedily, like the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the aforesaid movements, then from a sense of fittingness they hinder the receiving of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> during the day on which it happens. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 23:10</a>): "If there be among you any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that is defiled in a dream by night, he shall go forth out of the camp; and he shall not return before he be washed with water in the evening."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the stain of guilt be taken away by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> and confession nevertheless the bodily defilement is not taken away, nor the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> distraction which follows therefrom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> To dream of homicide brings no bodily <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, nor such distraction of mind as fornication, on account of its intense delectation; still if the dream of homicide comes of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in itself, especially if it be mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, then owing to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it hinders the receiving of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether food or drink taken beforehand hinders the receiving of this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that food or drink taken beforehand does not hinder the receiving of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> at the supper. But when the supper was ended <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> gave the sacrament to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as is evident from <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse20">Luke 22:20</a>, and from <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse25">1 Corinthians 11:25</a>. Therefore it seems that we ought to take this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> after receiving other food.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse33">1 Corinthians 11:33</a>): "When you come together to eat," namely, the Lord's body, "wait for one another; if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be hungry, let him eat at home": and thus it seems that after eating at home a man may eat <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we read in the (3rd) Council of Carthage (Can. xxix): "Let the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the altar be celebrated only by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, with the exception of the anniversary day on which the Lord's Supper is celebrated." Therefore, at least on that day, one may receive the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> after partaking of other food.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the taking of water or medicine, or of any other food or drink in very slight <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, or of the remains of food continuing in the mouth, neither breaks the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> fast, nor takes away the sobriety required for reverently receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Consequently, one is not prevented by the above things from receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, some eat and drink late at night, and possibly after passing a sleepless night receive the sacred mysteries in the morning when the food it not digested. But it would savor more of moderation if a man were to eat a little in the morning and afterwards receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> about the ninth hour, since also there is occasionally a longer interval of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Consequently, it seems that such taking of food beforehand does not keep one from this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, there is no less reverence due to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> after receiving it, than before. But one may take food and drink after receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore one may do so before receiving it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Resp. ad Januar., Ep. liv): "It has pleased the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> that, out of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> for this great sacrament, the Lord's body should enter the mouth of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> before other foods."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may prevent the receiving of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in two ways: first of all in itself, like mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is repugnant to what is signified by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>): secondly, on account of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> prohibition; and thus a man is prevented from taking this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> after receiving food or drink, for three reasons. First, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Resp. ad Januar., Ep. liv), "out of respect for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>," so that it may enter into a mouth not yet contaminated by any food or drink. Secondly, because of its signification. i.e. to give us to understand that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is the reality of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, ought to be first of all established in our hearts, according to <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse33">Matthew 6:33</a>: "Seek first the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Thirdly, on account of the danger of vomiting and intemperance, which sometimes arise from over-indulging in food, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse21">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>): "One, indeed, is hungry, and another is drunk."

<p>Nevertheless the sick are exempted from this general rule, for they should be given Communion at once, even after food, should there be any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to their danger, lest they die without Communion, because <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> has no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Hence it is said in the Canon de Consecratione: "Let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at once take Communion to the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, lest he die without Communion."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the same book, "the fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> gave this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> after taking food is no reason why the brethren should assemble after dinner or supper in order to partake of it, or receive it at meal-time, as did those whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> reproves and corrects. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, in order the more strongly to commend the depth of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, wished to fix it closely in the hearts and memories of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. and on that account He gave no command for it to be received in that order, leaving this to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, to whom He was about to entrust the government of the churches."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The text quoted is thus paraphrased by the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>: "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be hungry and loath to await the rest, let him partake of his food at home, that is, let him fill himself with earthly bread, without partaking of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> afterwards."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The wording of this decree is in accordance with the former custom observed by some of receiving the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on that day after breaking their fast, so as to represent the Lord's supper. But this is now abrogated, because as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Resp. ad Januar., Ep. liv), it is customary throughout the whole world for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body to be received before breaking the fast.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As stated in the II-II, 147, 6, ad 2, there are two kinds of fast. First, there is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> fast, which implies privation of everything taken before-hand by way of food or drink: and such fast is required for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> for the reasons given above. And therefore it is never lawful to take this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> after taking water, or other food or drink, or even medicine, no matter how small the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> be. Nor does it matter whether it nourishes or not, whether it be taken by itself or with other things, provided it be taken by way of food or drink. But the remains of food left in the mouth, if swallowed <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, do not hinder receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because they are swallowed not by way of food but by way of saliva. The same holds good of the unavoidable remains of the water or wine wherewith the mouth is rinsed, provided they be not swallowed in great <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but mixed with saliva.

<p>Secondly, there is the fast of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, instituted for afflicting the body: and this fast is not hindered by the things mentioned (in the objection), because they do not give much nourishment, but are taken rather as an alterative.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> That this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought to enter into the mouth of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> before any other food must not be understood absolutely of all time, otherwise he who had once eaten or drunk could never afterwards take this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: but it must be understood of the same day; and although the beginning of the day varies according to different systems of reckoning (for some begin their day at noon, some at sunset, others at midnight, and others at sunrise), the Roman Church begins it at midnight. Consequently, if any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> takes anything by way of food or drink after midnight, he may not receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> on that day; but he can do so if the food was taken before midnight. Nor does it matter, so far as the precept is concerned, whether he has slept after taking food or drink, or whether he has digested it; but it does matter as to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> disturbance which one suffers from want of sleep or from indigestion, for, if the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> be much disturbed, one becomes unfit for receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The greatest devotion is called for at the moment of receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because it is then that the effect of the sacrament is bestowed, and such devotion is hindered more by what goes before it than by what comes after it. And therefore it was ordained that men should fast before receiving the sacrament rather than after. Nevertheless there ought to be some interval between receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and taking other food. Consequently, both the Postcommunion <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of thanksgiving is said in the Mass, and the communicants say their own private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<p>However, according to the ancient Canons, the following ordination was made by Pope Clement I, (Ep. ii), "If the Lord's portion be eaten in the morning, the ministers who have taken it shall fast until the sixth hour, and if they take it at the third or fourth hour, they shall fast until evening." For in olden times, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> celebrated Mass less frequently, and with greater preparation: but now, because the sacred mysteries have to be celebrated oftener, the same could not be easily observed, and so it has been abrogated by contrary custom.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether those who have not the use of reason ought to receive this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that those who have not the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> ought not to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For it is required that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should approach this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> with devotion and previous self-examination, according to <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 11:28</a>: "Let a man <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>." But this is not possible for those who are devoid of reason. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should not be given to them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, among those who have not the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> are the possessed, who are called energumens. But such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are kept from even beholding this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. iii). Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought not to be given to those who have not the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, among those that lack the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> are children, the most innocent of all. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not given to children. Therefore much less should it be given to others deprived of the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We read in the First Council of Orange, (Canon 13); and the same is to be found in the Decretals (xxvi, 6): "All things that pertain to piety are to be given to the insane": and consequently, since this is the "sacrament of piety," it must be given to them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Men are said to be devoid of reason in two ways. First, when they are feeble-minded, as a man who sees dimly is said not to see: and since such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> can conceive some devotion towards this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it is not to be denied them.

<p>In another way men are said not to possess fully the use of reason. Either, then, they never had the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and have remained so from birth; and in that case this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not to be given to them, because in no way has there been any preceding devotion towards the sacrament: or else, they were not always devoid of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and then, if when they formerly had their wits they showed devotion towards this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it ought to be given to them in the hour of death; unless danger be feared of vomiting or spitting it out. Hence we read in the acts of the Fourth Council of Carthage (Canon 76). and the same is to be found in the Decretals (xxvi, 6): "If a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ask to receive the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>; and if, when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who has been sent for comes to him, he be so weak as to be unable to speak, or becomes delirious, let them, who heard him ask, bear witness, and let him receive the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>. then if it be thought that he is going to die shortly, let him be reconciled by imposition of hands, and let the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> be placed in his mouth."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those lacking the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> can have devotion towards the sacrament; actual devotion in some cases, and past in others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> is speaking there of energumens who are not yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, in whom the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power is not yet extinct, since it thrives in them through the presence of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. But as to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are vexed in body by <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> spirits, the same reason holds good of them as of others who are demented. Hence Cassian says (Collat. vii): "We do not remember the most Holy Communion to have ever been denied by our elders to them who are vexed by <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> spirits."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The same reason holds good of newly born children as of the insane who never have had the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: consequently, the sacred mysteries are not to be given to them. Although certain Greeks do the contrary, because <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. ii) that Holy Communion is to be given to them who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; not understanding that <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> is speaking there of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of adults. Nor do they suffer any loss of life from the fact of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> saying (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse54">John 6:54</a>), "Except you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and drink His blood, you shall not have life in you"; because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> writes to Boniface (Pseudo-Beda, Comment. in <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>), "then every one of the faithful becomes a partaker," i.e. spiritually, "of the body and blood of the Lord, when he is made a member of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." But when children once begin to have some use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> so as to be able to conceive some devotion for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, then it can be given to them.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether it is lawful to receive this sacrament daily?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It does not appear to be lawful to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> daily, because, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> shows forth <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, so also does this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now one may not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> several times, but only once, because "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died once" only "for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," according to <a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse18">1 Peter 3:18</a>. Therefore, it seems unlawful to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> daily.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the reality ought to answer to the figure. But the Paschal Lamb, which was the chief figure of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as was said above (Question 73, Article 9) was eaten only once in the year; while the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> once a year commemorates <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, of which this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is the memorial. It seems, then, that it is lawful to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> not daily, but only once in the year.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greatest reverence is due to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as containing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But it is a token of reverence to refrain from receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; hence the Centurion is praised for saying (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse8">Matthew 8:8</a>), "Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof"; also Peter, for saying (<a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse8">Luke 5:8</a>), "Depart from me, for I am a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, O Lord." Therefore, it is not praiseworthy for a man to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> daily.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if it were a praiseworthy custom to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> frequently, then the oftener it were taken the more praise-worthy it would be. But there would be greater frequency if one were to receive it several. times daily; and yet this is not the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Consequently, it does not seem praiseworthy to receive it daily.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by her statutes intends to promote the welfare of the faithful. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> statute only requires Communion once a year; hence it is enacted (Extra, De Poenit. et Remiss. xii): "Let every <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of either sex devoutly receive the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> at least at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>; unless by the advice of his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and for some reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, he considers he ought to refrain from receiving for a time." Consequently, it is not praiseworthy to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> daily.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom., Serm. xxviii): "This is our daily bread; take it daily, that it may profit thee daily."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two things to be considered regarding the use of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. The first is on the part of the sacrament itself, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of which gives health to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and consequently it is profitable to receive it daily so as to receive its fruits daily. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. iv): "If, whenever <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood is shed, it is shed for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, I who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> often, should receive it often: I need a frequent remedy." The second thing to be considered is on the part of the recipient, who is required to approach this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> with great reverence and devotion. Consequently, if anyone finds that he has these dispositions every day, he will do well to receive it daily. Hence, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> after saying, "Receive daily, that it may profit thee daily," adds: "So live, as to deserve to receive it daily." But because many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are lacking in this devotion, on account of the many drawbacks both <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and corporal from which they suffer, it is not expedient for all to approach this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> every day; but they should do so as often as they find themselves properly disposed. Hence it is said in De Eccles. Dogmat. liii: "I neither praise nor blame daily reception of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> a man is conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, by receiving His character within him. And therefore, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died but once, so a man ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> but once. But a man does not receive Christ's character in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; He receives <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, Whose <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> endures for ever. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse14">Hebrews 10:14</a>): "By one oblation He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified." Consequently, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has daily need of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> health-giving <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, he may commendably receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> every day.

<p>And since <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is above all a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, therefore, as a man is born <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> but once, so ought he by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> to be reborn spiritually but once, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xi in Joan.), <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse4">John 3:4</a>, "How can a man be born again, when he is grown old?" But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food; hence, just as bodily food is taken every day, so is it a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> every day. Hence it is that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse3">Luke 11:3</a>), teaches us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, "Give us this day our daily bread": in explaining which words <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Verb. Dom., Serm. xxviii): "If you receive it," i.e. this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, every day, "every day is today for thee, and Christ rises again every day in thee, for when Christ riseth it is today."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Paschal Lamb was the figure of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> chiefly as to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> represented therein; and therefore it was partaken of once a year only, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died but once. And on this account the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrates once a year the remembrance of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. But in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the memorial of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is given by way of food which is partaken of daily; and therefore in this respect it is represented by the manna which was given daily to the people in the desert.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Reverence for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> consists in fear associated with love; consequently reverential fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called filial fear, as was said in I-II, 67, 4, ad 2; II-II, 19, 9,11,12; because the desire of receiving arises from love, while the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> of reverence springs from fear. Consequently, each of these belongs to the reverence due to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; both as to receiving it daily, and as to refraining from it sometimes. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. liv): "If one says that the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> should not be received daily, while another maintains the contrary, let each one do as according to his devotion he thinketh right; for Zaccheus and the Centurion did not contradict one another while the one received the Lord with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, whereas the other said: 'Lord I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof'; since both <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> our Saviour, though not in the same way." But love and hope, whereunto the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> constantly urge us, are preferable to fear. Hence, too, when Peter had said, "Depart from me, for I am a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, O Lord," <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: "Fear not."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse3">Luke 11:3</a>), "Give us this day our daily bread," we are not on that account to communicate several times daily, for, by one daily communion the unity of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is set forth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Various statutes have emanated according to the various ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the primitive Church, when the devotion of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was more flourishing, it was enacted that the faithful should communicate daily: hence Pope Anaclete says (Ep. i): "When the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is finished, let all communicate who do not wish to cut themselves off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for so the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> have ordained, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Roman Church holds." Later on, when the fervor of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> relaxed, Pope Fabian (Third Council of Tours, Canon 1) gave permission "that all should communicate, if not more frequently, at least three times in the year, namely, at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, Pentecost, and Christmas." Pope Soter likewise (Second Council of Chalon, Canon xlvii) declares that Communion should be received "on Holy Thursday," as is set forth in the Decretals (De Consecratione, dist. 2). Later on, when "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> abounded and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> grew cold" (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew 24:12</a>), <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> commanded that the faithful should communicate "at least once a year," namely, "at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>." However, in De Eccles. Dogmat. xxiii, the faithful are counseled "to communicate on all Sundays."

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether it is lawful to abstain altogether from communion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems to be lawful to abstain altogether from Communion. Because the Centurion is praised for saying (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse8">Matthew 8:8</a>): "Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof"; and he who deems that he ought to refrain entirely from Communion can be compared to the Centurion, as stated above (10, ad 3). Therefore, since we do not read of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> entering his house, it seems to be lawful for any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> to abstain from Communion his whole life long.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is lawful for anyone to refrain from what is not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as was stated above (Question 73, Article 3). Therefore it is permissible to abstain from Communion altogether.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, sinners are not bound to go to Communion: hence Pope Fabian (Third Council of Tours, Canon 1) after saying, "Let all communicate thrice each year," adds: "Except those who are hindered by grievous crimes." Consequently, if those who are not in the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are bound to go to Communion, it seems that sinners are better off than <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> people, which is unfitting. Therefore, it seems lawful even for the godly to refrain from Communion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse54">John 6:54</a>): "Except ye eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and drink His blood, you shall not have life in you."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), there are two ways of receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> namely, spiritually and sacramentally. Now it is clear that all are bound to eat it at least spiritually, because this is to be incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as was said above (73, 3, ad 1). Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating comprises the desire or yearning for receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as was said above (1, ad 3, 2). Therefore, a man cannot be saved without desiring to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>Now a desire would be vain except it were fulfilled when opportunity presented itself. Consequently, it is evident that a man is bound to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not only by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> precept, but also by virtue of the Lord's command (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse19">Luke 22:19</a>): "Do this in memory of Me." But by the precept of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there are fixed times for fulfilling <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> command.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says: "He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, who is not obstinate in rejecting what is commanded for his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Consequently, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is not praiseworthy if anyone abstains altogether from Communion against the precept of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Again the Centurion was not commanded to receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> into his house.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This sacrament is said not to be as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, with regard to children, who can be saved without the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, but not without the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>: both, however, are of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> with regard to adults.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sinners suffer great loss in being kept back from receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, so that they are not better off on that account; and although while continuing in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they are not on that account excused from transgressing the precept, nevertheless, as <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> says, penitents, "who refrain on the advice of their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>," are excused.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether it is lawful to receive the body of Christ without the blood?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems unlawful to receive the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> without the blood. For <a href="../cathen/06406a.htm">Pope Gelasius</a> says (cf. De Consecr. ii): "We have learned that some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> after taking only a portion of the sacred body, abstain from the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of the sacred blood. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not for what <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> motive they do this: therefore let them either receive the entire sacrament, or let them be withheld from the sacrament altogether." Therefore it is not lawful to receive the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> without His blood.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the eating of the body and the drinking of the blood are required for the perfection of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (73, 2; 76, 2, ad 1). Consequently, if the body be taken without the blood, it will be an imperfect sacrament, which seems to savor of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/06406a.htm">Pope Gelasius</a> adds (cf. De Consecr. ii), "because the dividing of one and the same <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> cannot happen without a great <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is celebrated in memory of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, as stated above (73, 4,5; 74, 1), and is received for the health of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is expressed in the blood rather than in the body; moreover, as stated above (Question 74, Article 1), the blood is offered for the health of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently, one ought to refrain from receiving the body rather than the blood. Therefore, such as approach this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought not to take <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body without His blood.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is the custom of many churches for the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be given to the communicant without His blood.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two points should be observed regarding the use of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, one on the part of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, the other on the part of the recipients; on the part of the sacrament it is proper for both the body and the blood to be received, since the perfection of the sacrament lies in both, and consequently, since it is the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> both to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> and finish the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, he ought on no account to receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body without the blood.

<p>But on the part of the recipient the greatest reverence and caution are called for, lest anything happen which is unworthy of so great a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. Now this could especially happen in receiving the blood, for, if incautiously handled, it might easily be spilt. And because the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people increased, in which there are old, young, and children, some of whom have not enough discretion to observe due caution in using this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, on that account it is a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> custom in some churches for the blood not to be offered to the reception of the people, but to be received by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06406a.htm">Pope Gelasius</a> is speaking of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who, as they <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the entire sacrament, ought to communicate in the entire sacrament. For, as we read in the (Twelfth) Council of Toledo, "What kind of a sacrifice is that, wherein not even the sacrificer is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have a share?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The perfection of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not lie in the use of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. And hence there is nothing derogatory to the perfection of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; if the people receive the body without the blood, provided that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who consecrates receive both.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is represented in the very <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, in which the body ought not to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without the blood. But the body can be received by the people without the blood: nor is this detrimental to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> both offers and consumes the blood on behalf of all; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is fully contained under either <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as was shown above (Question 76, Article 2).
