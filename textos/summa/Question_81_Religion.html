<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether religion directs man to God alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that religion does not direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. It is written (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse27">James 1:27</a>): "Religion clean and undefiled before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> in their tribulation, and to keep oneself unspotted from this world." Now "to visit the fatherless and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>" indicates an order between oneself and one's neighbor, and "to keep oneself unspotted from this world" belongs to the order of a man within himself. Therefore religion does not imply order to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x, 1) that "since in speaking <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> not only unlettered but even most cultured <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> ere wont to speak of religion as being exhibited, to our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> kindred and relations as also to those who are linked with us by any kind of tie, that term does not escape ambiguity when it is a question of Divine worship, so that we be able to say without hesitation that religion is nothing else but the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore religion signifies a relation not only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but also to our kindred.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, seemingly <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">"latria"</a> pertains to religion. Now "latria signifies servitude," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Civ. Dei x, 1). And we are bound to serve not only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also our neighbor, according to <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse13">Galatians 5:13</a>, "By <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the spirit serve one another." Therefore religion includes a relation to one's neighbor also.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, worship belongs to religion. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to worship not only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also his neighbor, according to the saying of Cato [Dionysius Cato, Breves Sententiae], "Worship thy parents." Therefore religion directs us also to our neighbor, and not only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, all those who are in the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a> are subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet not all who are in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a> are called religious, but only those who bind themselves by certain <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and observances, and to obedience to certain men. Therefore religion seemingly does not denote a relation of subjection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully says (Rhet. ii, 53) that "religion consists in offering service and ceremonial rites to a superior <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that men call divine."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x), "according to Cicero, a man is said to be religious from 'religio,' because he often ponders over, and, as it were, reads again [relegit], the things which pertain to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," so that religion would seem to take its name from reading over those things which belong to Divine worship because we ought frequently to ponder over such things in our hearts, according to <a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse6">Proverbs 3:6</a>, "In all thy ways think on Him." According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei x, 3) it may also take its name from the fact that "we ought to seek <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> again, whom we had lost by our neglect" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> plays on the words 'reeligere,' i.e. to choose over again, and 'negligere,' to neglect or despise.]. Or again, religion may be derived from "religare" [to bind together], wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. 55): "May religion bind us to the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>." However, whether religion take its name from frequent reading, or from a repeated choice of what has been lost through negligence, or from being a bond, it denotes properly a relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is He to Whom we ought to be bound as to our unfailing principle; to Whom also our choice should be resolutely directed as to our last end; and Whom we lose when we neglect Him by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and should recover by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in Him and confessing our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Religion has two kinds of acts. Some are its proper and immediate acts, which it elicits, and by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, for instance, sacrifice, adoration and the like. But it has other acts, which it produces through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which it commands, directing them to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is concerned with the end, commands the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are concerned with the means. Accordingly "to visit the fatherless and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> in their tribulation" is an act of religion as commanding, and an act of mercy as eliciting; and "to keep oneself unspotted from this world" is an act of religion as commanding, but of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> or of some similar <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as eliciting.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Religion is referred to those things one exhibits to one's <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> kindred, if we take the term religion in a broad sense, but not if we take it in its proper sense. Hence, shortly before the passage quoted, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says: "In a stricter sense religion seems to denote, not any kind of worship, but the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since servant implies relation to a lord, wherever there is a special kind of lordship there must needs be a special kind of service. Now it is evident that lordship belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a special and singular way, because He made all things, and has supreme dominion over all. Consequently a special kind of service is due to Him, which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" in Greek; and therefore it belongs to religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> We are said to worship those whom we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and to cultivate [In the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> the same word 'colere' stands for 'worship' and 'cultivate']: a man's <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> or presence: we even speak of cultivating things that are beneath us, thus a farmer [agricola] is one who cultivates the land, and an inhabitant [incola] is one who cultivates the place where he dwells. Since, however, special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the first principle of all things, to Him also is due a special kind of worship, which in Greek is <em>Eusebeia</em> or <em>Theosebeia</em>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Civ. Dei x, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Although the name "religious" may be given to all in general who worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet in a special way religious are those who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> their whole life to the Divine worship, by withdrawing from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. Thus also the term "contemplative" is applied, not to those who contemplate, but to those who give up their whole lives to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Such men subject themselves to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> sake but for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, according to the word of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse14">Galatians 4:14</a>), "You . . . received me as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether religion is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that religion is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Seemingly it belongs to religion to pay reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But reverence is an act of fear which is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, as stated above (Question 19, Article 09). Therefore religion is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> but a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a free exercise of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, wherefore it is described as an "elective" or <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>" [Ethic. ii, 6. Now, as stated above (1, ad 3) "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" belongs to religion, and "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" denotes a kind of servitude. Therefore religion is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to Ethic. ii, 1, aptitude for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, wherefore things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> belong to the dictate of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now, it belongs to religion "to offer ceremonial worship to the Godhead" [Cf. 1, and ceremonial matters, as stated above (I-II, 99, 3, ad 2; I-II, 101), do not belong to the dictate of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Therefore religion is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is enumerated with the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as appears from what has been said above (<a href="#80">Article 80</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (58, 3; I-II, 55, 3,4) "a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that which makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and his act <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> likewise," wherefore we must needs say that every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act belongs to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it is evident that to render anyone his due has the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since by rendering a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> his due, one becomes suitably proportioned to him, through being ordered to him in a becoming manner.

<p>But order comes under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, just as mode and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Nat. Boni iii). Since then it belongs to religion to pay due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to someone, namely, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is evident that religion is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To pay reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear. Now it belongs to religion to do certain things through reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it follows, not that religion is the same as the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear, but that it is referred thereto as to something more excellent; for the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are more excellent than the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (9, 1, ad 3; I-II, 68, 8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> can <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> do his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> by his master, and so "he makes a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>" [ <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, Ep. liv, ad Furiam.], by doing his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>. On like manner, to render due service to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does so <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It belongs to the dictate of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should do something through reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But that he should do this or that determinate thing does not belong to the dictate of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but is established by Divine or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether religion is one virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that religion is not one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Religion directs us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there are three Persons; and also many attributes, which differ at least <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> from one another. Now a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> difference in the object suffices for a difference of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (50, 2, ad 2). Therefore religion is not one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> there is seemingly one act, since <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are distinguished by their acts. Now there are many acts of religion, for instance to worship, to serve, to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, to sacrifice and many such like. Therefore religion is not one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, adoration belongs to religion. Now adoration is paid to images under one aspect, and under another aspect to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. Since, then, a difference of aspect distinguishes <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, it would seem that religion is not one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5</a>): "One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Lord'], one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion professes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore religion is one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 54, 2, ad 1), <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are differentiated according to a different aspect of the object. Now it belongs to religion to show reverence to one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> under one aspect, namely, as the first principle of the creation and government of things. Wherefore He Himself says (<a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse6">Malachi 1:6</a>): "If . . . I be a father, where is My <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>?" For it belongs to a father to beget and to govern. Therefore it is evident that religion is one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The three Divine Persons are the one principle of the creation and government of things, wherefore they are served by one religion. The different aspects of the attributes concur under the aspect of first principle, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produces all things, and governs them by the wisdom, will and power of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Wherefore religion is one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By the one same act <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> both serves and worships <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for worship regards the excellence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom reverence is due: while service regards the subjection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who, by his <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, is under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of showing reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To these two belong all acts ascribed to religion, because, by them all, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> bears witness to the Divine excellence and to his own subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either by offering something to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or by assuming something Divine.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The worship of religion is paid to images, not as considered in themselves, nor as things, but as images leading us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>. Now movement to an image as image does not stop at the image, but goes on to the thing it represents. Hence neither "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" nor the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of religion is differentiated by the fact that religious worship is paid to the images of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether religion is a special virtue, distinct from the others?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that religion is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from the others. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x, 6): "Any action whereby we are united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fellowship, is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice." But sacrifice belongs to religion. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> belongs to religion; and consequently religion is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse31">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>): "Do all to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now it belongs to religion to do anything in reverence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (1, ad 2; 2). Therefore religion is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not distinct from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby we love our neighbor. But according to Ethic. viii, 8 "to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> is almost to be loved." Therefore the religion whereby we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from observance, or "dulia," or piety whereby we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> our neighbor. Therefore religion is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, distinct from the other parts.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, wherever there is a special aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, there must be a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which religion is directed, is to give due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Again, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to someone under the aspect of excellence: and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a singular excellence is competent, since He <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> surpasses all things and exceeds them in every way. Wherefore to Him is special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due: even as in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs we see that different <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to different personal excellences, one kind of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to a father, another to the king, and so on. Hence it is evident that religion is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is said to be a sacrifice, in so far as it is done out of reverence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence this does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that religion is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but that it commands all other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (1, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, in so far as it is done in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, belongs to religion, not as eliciting but as commanding: those belong to religion as eliciting which pertain to the reverence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by reason of their specific character.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The object of love is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but the object of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and reverence is something excellent. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is communicated to the creature, but the excellence of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is not. Hence the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is loved is not distinct from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby our neighbor is loved; whereas the religion whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> our neighbor.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether religion is a theological virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that religion is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion iii) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is worshiped by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," which are theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now it belongs to religion to pay worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore religion is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is one that has <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its object. Now religion has <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its object, since it directs us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore religion is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is either theological, or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, or moral, as is clear from what has been said (I-II, 57,58,62). Now it is evident that religion is not an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because its perfection does not depend on the consideration of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: nor is it a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which consists properly in observing the mean between too much and too little. for one cannot worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> too much, according to <a href="../bible/sir043.htm#verse33">Sirach 43:33</a>, "Blessing the Lord, exalt Him as much as you can; for He is above all praise." Therefore it remains that it is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>) religion pays due worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence two things are to be considered in religion: first that which it offers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, viz. worship, and this is by way of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and object in religion; secondly, that to which something is offered, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom worship is paid. And yet the acts whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is worshiped do not reach out to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself, as when we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we reach out to Him by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>; for which reason it was stated (1, 1 and 2 and 4) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not only because we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but because we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Now due worship is paid to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in so far as certain acts whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is worshiped, such as the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and so forth, are done out of reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is related to religion not as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or object, but as end: and consequently religion is not a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whose object is the last end, but a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is properly about things referred to the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The power or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whose action deals with an end, moves by its command the power or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whose action deals with matters directed to that end. Now the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> have an act in reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their proper object: wherefore, by their command, they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the act of religion, which performs certain <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and so <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is worshiped by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Religion directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not as its object but as its end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Religion is neither a theological nor an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, but a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and observes a mean, not in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but in actions directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by establishing a kind of equality in them. And when I say "equality," I do not mean absolute equality, because it is not possible to pay <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as much as we owe Him, but equality in consideration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ability and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> acceptance.

<p>And it is possible to have too much in matters pertaining to the Divine worship, not as regards the circumstance of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but as regards other circumstances, as when Divine worship is paid to whom it is not due, or when it is not due, or unduly in respect of some other circumstance.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether religion should be preferred to the other moral virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that religion should not be preferred to the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. The perfection of a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in its observing the mean, as stated in Ethic. ii, 6. But religion fails to observe the mean of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since it does not render an absolute equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore religion is not more excellent than the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is offered by one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to another is the more praiseworthy, according as the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> it is offered to is in greater need: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/isa057.htm#verse7">Isaiah 57:7</a>): "Deal thy bread to the hungry."

<p>But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> needs nothing that we can offer Him, according to <a href="../bible/psa015.htm#verse2">Psalm 15:2</a>, "I have said: Thou art my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for Thou hast no need of my goods." Therefore religion would seem less praiseworthy than the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> needs are relieved.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greater. the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to do a thing, the less praise does it deserve, according to <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>, "If I preach the Gospel, it is no <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to me: a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> lieth upon me." Now the more a thing is due, the greater the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of paying it. Since, then, what is paid to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in the highest degree due to Him, it would seem that religion is less praiseworthy than the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The precepts pertaining to religion are given precedence (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm">Exodus 20</a>) as being of greatest importance. Now the order of precepts is proportionate to the order of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> prescribe acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore religion is the chief of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whatever is directed to an end takes its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> from being ordered to that end; so that the nearer it is to the end the better it is. Now moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (5; 04, 7), are about matters that are ordered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their end. And religion approaches nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in so far as its actions are directly and immediately ordered to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence religion excels among the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Virtue is praised because of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, not because of the ability: and therefore if a man fall short of equality which is the mean of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, through lack of ability, his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> deserves no less praise, provided there be no failing on the part of his will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In offering a thing to a man on account of its usefulness to him, the more needy the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the more praiseworthy the offering, because it is more useful: whereas we offer a thing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not on account of its usefulness to Him, but for the sake of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and on account of its usefulness to us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Where there is an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to do a thing it loses the luster of supererogation, but not the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, provided it be done <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>. Hence the argument proves nothing.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether religion has an external act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that religion has not an external act. It is written (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John 4:24</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a spirit, and they that <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Him, must <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Him in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now external acts pertain, not to the spirit but to the body. Therefore religion, to which adoration belongs, has acts that are not external but internal.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the end of religion is to pay <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reverence and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Now it would savor of irreverence towards a superior, if one were to offer him that which properly belongs to his inferior. Since then whatever <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> offers by bodily actions, seems to be directed properly to the relief of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> needs, or to the reverence of inferior creatures, it would seem unbecoming to employ them in showing reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei vi, 10) commends Seneca for finding fault with those who offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> those things that are wont to be offered to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because, to wit, that which befits mortals is unbecoming to immortals. But such things are much less becoming to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is "exalted above all gods" [<a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse3">Psalm 94:3</a>. Therefore it would seem wrong to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with bodily actions. Therefore religion has no bodily actions.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse3">Psalm 83:3</a>): "My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now just as internal actions belong to the heart, so do external actions belong to the members of the flesh. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ought to be worshiped not only by internal but also by external actions.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We pay <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and reverence, not for His sake (because He is of Himself full of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to which no creature can add anything), but for our own sake, because by the very fact that we revere and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is subjected to Him; wherein its perfection consists, since a thing is perfected by being subjected to its superior, for instance the body is perfected by being quickened by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the air by being enlightened by the sun. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, in order to be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, needs to be guided by the sensible world, since "invisible things . . . are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>). Wherefore in the Divine worship it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to make use of corporeal things, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind may be aroused thereby, as by signs, to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> acts by means of which he is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the internal acts of religion take precedence of the others and belong to religion <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, while its external acts are secondary, and subordinate to the internal acts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> is speaking of that which is most important and directly intended in the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These external things are offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not as though He stood in need of them, according to <a href="../bible/psa049.htm#verse13">Psalm 49:13</a>, "Shall I eat the flesh of bullocks? or shall I drink the blood of goats?" but as signs of the internal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> works, which are of themselves acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x, 5): "The visible sacrifice is the sacrament or sacred sign of the invisible sacrifice."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Idolaters are ridiculed for offering to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not as signs arousing them to certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, but as though they were of themselves acceptable to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; and still more because they were foolish and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether religion is the same as sanctity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that religion is not the same as sanctity. Religion is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>): whereas sanctity is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because it makes us faithful, and fulfil our just <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to Andronicus [De Affectibus]. Therefore sanctity is not the same as religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sanctity seems to denote a kind of purity. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. xii) that "sanctity is free from all <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, and is perfect and altogether unspotted purity." Now purity would seem above all to pertain to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> which repels bodily <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>. Since then religion belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, it would seem that sanctity is not the same as religion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things that are opposite members of a division are not identified with one another. But in an enumeration given above (80, ad 4) of the parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, sanctity is reckoned as distinct from religion. Therefore sanctity is not the same as religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse74">Luke 1:74-75</a>): "That . . . we may serve Him . . . in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." Now, "to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" belongs to religion, as stated above (1, ad 3; 3, ad 2). Therefore religion is the same as sanctity.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word "sanctity" seems to have two significations. On one way it denotes purity; and this signification fits in with the Greek, for <em>hagios</em> means "unsoiled." On another way it denotes firmness, wherefore in olden times the term "sancta" was applied to such things as were upheld by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and were not to be violated. Hence a thing is said to be sacred [sancitum] when it is ratified by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Again, in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, this word "sanctus" may be connected with purity, if it be resolved into "sanguine tinctus, since, in olden times, those who wished to be purified were sprinkled with the victim's blood," according to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. x). In either case the signification requires sanctity to be ascribed to those things that are applied to the Divine worship; so that not only men, but also the temple, vessels and such like things are said to be sanctified through being applied to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For purity is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is soiled by contact with inferior things, even as all things depreciate by admixture with baser things, for instance, silver by being mixed with lead. Now in order for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to be united to the Supreme Being it must be withdrawn from inferior things: and hence it is that without purity the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> cannot be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse14">Hebrews 12:14</a>): "Follow peace with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, without which no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Again, firmness is required for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is applied to Him as its last end and first beginning, and such things must needs be most immovable. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> said (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse38">Romans 8:38-39</a>): "I am sure that neither death, nor life . . . shall separate me [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'shall be able to separate us'] from the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>Accordingly, it is by sanctity that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind applies itself and its acts to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: so that it differs from religion not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> but only <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>. For it takes the name of religion according as it gives <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> due service in matters pertaining specially to the Divine worship, such as <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, oblations, and so forth; while it is called sanctity, according as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> refers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not only these but also the works of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, or according as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by means of certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works disposes himself to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sanctity is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> according to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and in this respect it is in a way identified with religion. But it has a certain generality, in so far as by its command it directs the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, even as legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is said to be a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as it directs the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Temperance practices purity, yet not so as to have the character of sanctity unless it be referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> itself <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virgin. viii) that "it is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> not for what it is, but for being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sanctity differs from religion as explained above, not really but <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>.
