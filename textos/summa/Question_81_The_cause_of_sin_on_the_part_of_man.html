<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the first sin of our first parent is contracted by his descendants, by way of origin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> is not contracted by others, by way of origin. For it is written (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse20">Ezekiel 18:20</a>): "The son shall not bear the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the father." But he would bear the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> if he contracted it from him. Therefore no one contracts any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from one of his parents by way of origin.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is not transmitted by way of origin, unless its subject be also transmitted, since <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> do not pass from one subject to another. Now the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is not transmitted by way of origin, as was shown in the I, 118, 2. Therefore neither can any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be transmitted by way of origin.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever is transmitted by way of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> origin, is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the semen. But the semen cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it lacks the rational part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which alone can be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be contracted by way of origin.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, that which is more perfect in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is more powerful in action. Now perfect flesh cannot infect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united to it, else the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could not be cleansed of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, so long as it is united to the body. Much less, therefore, can the semen infect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 5): "No one finds fault with those who are ugly by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but only those who are so through want of exercise and through carelessness." Now those are said to be "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> ugly," who are so from their origin. Therefore nothing which comes by way of origin is blameworthy or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>): "By one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into this world, and by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> death." Nor can this be understood as denoting imitation or suggestion, since it is written (<a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse24">Wisdom 2:24</a>): "By the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, death came into this world." It follows therefore that through origin from the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> we are bound to hold that the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is transmitted to his descendants, by way of origin. For this reason children are taken to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> soon after their birth, to show that they have to be washed from some <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>. The contrary is part of the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in many of his books [For instance, Retract. i, 9; De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. ix; Contra Julian. iii, 1; De Dono Persev. xi, xii.]

<p>In endeavoring to explain how the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> could be transmitted by way of origin to his descendants, various writers have gone about it in various ways. For some, considering that the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, maintained that the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is transmitted with the semen, so that thus an infected <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would seem to produce other infected <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Others, rejecting this as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, endeavored to show how the guilt of the parent's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can be transmitted to the children, even though the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be not transmitted, from the fact that defects of the body are transmitted from parent to child--thus a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> may beget a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, or a gouty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be the father of a gouty son, on account of some seminal corruption, although this corruption is not <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> or gout. Now since the body is proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> defects redound into the body, and vice versa, in like manner, say they, a culpable defect of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is passed on to the child, through the transmission of the semen, albeit the semen itself is not the subject of the guilt.

<p>But all these explanations are insufficient. Because, granted that some bodily defects are transmitted by way of origin from parent to child, and granted that even some defects of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are transmitted in consequence, on account of a defect in the bodily <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as in the case of idiots begetting idiots; nevertheless the fact of having a defect by the way of origin seems to exclude the notion of guilt, which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> something <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Wherefore granted that the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were transmitted, from the very fact that the stain on the child's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not in its will, it would cease to be a guilty stain binding its subject to punishment; for, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 5), "no one reproaches a man born blind; one rather takes pity on him."

<p>Therefore we must explain the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> otherwise by saying that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> born of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> may be considered as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inasmuch as they have one common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which they receive from their first parents; even as in civil matters, all who are members of one community are reputed as one body, and the whole community as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Indeed Porphyry says (Praedic., De Specie) that "by sharing the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, many men are one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Accordingly the multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> born of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, are as so many members of one body. Now the action of one member of the body, of the hand for instance, is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> not by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of that hand, but by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the first mover of the members. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> which the hand commits would not be imputed as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the hand, considered by itself as apart from the body, but is imputed to it as something belonging to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and moved by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first moving principle. In this way, then, the disorder which is in this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> born of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, not by his will, but by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, who, by the movement of generation, moves all who originate from him, even as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> will moves all the members to their actions. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is thus transmitted by the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> to his descendants is called "original," just as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which flows from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into the bodily members is called "actual." And just as the actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is committed by a member of the body, is not the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of that member, except inasmuch as that member is a part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for which reason it is called a "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>"; so <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of this <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, except inasmuch as this <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> receives his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from his <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, for which reason it is called the "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," according to <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse3">Ephesians 2:3</a>: "We . . . were by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> children of wrath."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The son is said not to bear the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of his father, because he is not punished for his father's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless he share in his guilt. It is thus in the case before us: because guilt is transmitted by the way of origin from father to son, even as actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is transmitted through being imitated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not transmitted, because the power in the semen is not able to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nevertheless the motion of the semen is a disposition to the transmission of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: so that the semen by its own power transmits the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from parent to child, and with that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the stain which infects it: for he that is born is associated with his <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> in his guilt, through the fact that he inherits his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from him by a kind of movement which is that of generation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the guilt is not actually in the semen, yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is there virtually accompanied by that guilt.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The semen is the principle of generation, which is an act proper to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, by helping it to propagate itself. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more infected by the semen, than by the flesh which is already perfect, and already affixed to a certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not blamed for that which he has from his origin, if we consider the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> born, in himself. But it we consider him as referred to a principle, then he may be reproached for it: thus a man may from his birth be under a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> disgrace, on account of a crime committed by one of his forbears.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether also other sins of the first parent or of nearer ancestors are transmitted to their descendants?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that also other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, whether of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> or of nearer ancestors, are transmitted to their descendants. For punishment is never due unless for fault. Now some are punished by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of their immediate parents, according to <a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse5">Exodus 20:5</a>: "I am . . . <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . jealous, visiting the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation." Furthermore, according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, the children of those who are guilty of high treason are disinherited. Therefore the guilt of nearer ancestors is also transmitted to their descendants.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man can better transmit to another, that which he has of himself, than that which he has received from another: thus fire heats better than hot water does. Now a man transmits to his children, by the way, of origin, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he has from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. Much more therefore should he transmit the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he has contracted of himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the reason why we contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> from our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> is because we were in him as in the principle of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which he corrupted. But we were likewise in our nearer ancestors, as in principles of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which however it be corrupt, can be corrupted yet more by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse11">Apocalypse 22:11</a>: "He that is filthy, let him be filthier still." Therefore children contract, by the way of origin, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of their nearer ancestors, even as they contract the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of their <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Good is more self-diffusive than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of the nearer ancestors are not transmitted to their descendants. Much less therefore are their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> puts this question in the Enchiridion xlvi, xlvii, and leaves it unsolved. Yet if we look into the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> carefully we shall see that it is impossible for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the nearer ancestors, or even any other but the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> to be transmitted by way of origin. The reason is that a man begets his like in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> but not in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Consequently those things that pertain directly to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, such as personal actions and matters affecting them, are not transmitted by parents to their children: for a grammarian does not transmit to his son the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of grammar that he has acquired by his own studies. On the other hand, those things that concern the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, are transmitted by parents to their children, unless there be a defect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: thus a man with eyes begets a son having eyes, unless <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> fails. And if <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be strong, even certain <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> pertaining to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition, are transmitted to the children, e.g. fleetness of body, acuteness of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and so forth; but nowise those that are purely personal, as stated above.

<p>Now just as something may belong to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as such, and also something through the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so may something belong to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as such, viz. whatever is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the principles of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and something too through the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. In this way original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated in the I, 100, 1, was a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, conferred by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>. This <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lost by his first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore as that original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> together with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was to have been transmitted to his posterity, so also was its disorder. Other actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, however, whether of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> or of others, do not corrupt the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but only as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, i.e. in respect of the proneness to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and consequently other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not transmitted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in his letter to Avitus [Ep. ad Auxilium ccl.], children are never inflicted with <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> punishment on account of their parents, unless they share in their guilt, either in their origin, or by imitation, because every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> immediate property, as stated in <a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse4">Ezekiel 18:4</a>. Sometimes, however, by Divine or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment, children receive bodily punishment on their parents' account, inasmuch as the child, as to its body, is part of its father.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can more easily transmit that which he has of himself, provided it be transmissible. But the actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of our nearer ancestors are not transmissible, because they are purely personal, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> infects <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> corruption pertaining to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; whereas other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> infect it with a corruption pertaining only to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the sin of the first parent is transmitted, by the way of origin, to all men?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> is not transmitted, by the way of origin, to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Because death is a punishment consequent upon <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. But not all those, who are born of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, will die: since those who will be still living at the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, will never die, as, seemingly, may be gathered from <a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse14">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>: "We who are alive . . . unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who have slept." Therefore they do not contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one gives another what he has not himself. Now a man who has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> has not <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Therefore he does not transmit it to his children.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse15">Romans 5:15, seqq</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not transmitted to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: neither, therefore, is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>): "Death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in whom all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> we must firmly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone excepted, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> descended from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> from him; else all would not need redemption [Cf. Translator's note inserted before TP, 27] which is through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; and this is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. The reason for this may be gathered from what has been stated (1), viz. that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, is transmitted to his posterity, just as, from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> will, actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is transmitted to the members of the body, through their being moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now it is evident that actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be transmitted to all such members as have an inborn aptitude to be moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is transmitted to all those who are moved by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> by the movement of generation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is held with greater probability and more commonly that all those that are alive at the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, will die, and rise again shortly, as we shall state more fully in the TP (XP, 78, 1, Objection 1). If, however, it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as others hold, that they will never die, (an opinion which <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> mentions among others in a letter to Minerius, on the Resurrection of the Body--Ep. cxix), then we must say in reply to the objection, that although they are not to die, the debt of death is none the less in them, and that the punishment of death will be remitted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He can also forgive the punishment due for actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> as to the guilt, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> recovers <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as regards the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> remains in its effect as regards the "fomes," which is the disorder of the lower parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of the body itself, in respect of which, and not of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> exercises his power of generation. Consequently those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> transmit <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>: since they do not beget as being renewed in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, but as still retaining something of the oldness of the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is transmitted to all who are born of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> corporally, so is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> transmitted to all that are begotten of Him spiritually, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: and this, not only unto the removal of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of their <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, but also unto the removal of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the obtaining of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether original sin would be contracted by a person formed miraculously from human flesh?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> would be contracted by a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> formed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse1">Genesis 4:1</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> entire posterity was corrupted in his loins, because they were not severed from him in the place of life, before he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, but in the place of exile after he had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>." But if a man were to be formed in the aforesaid manner, his flesh would be severed in the place of exile. Therefore it would contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being infected through the flesh. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> flesh is entirely corrupted. Therefore a man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would contract the infection of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, from whatever part of the flesh it was formed.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> comes upon all from our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, in so far as we were all in him when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. But those who might be formed out of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, would have been in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. Therefore they would contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> They would not have been in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> "according to seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," which alone is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the transmission of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Gen. ad lit. x, 18, seqq.).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1,3), <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is transmitted from the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> to his posterity, inasmuch as they are moved by him through generation, even as the members are moved by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now there is no movement to generation except by the active power of generation: so that those alone contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, who are descended from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> through the active power of generation originally derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, i.e. who are descended from him through seminal power; for the seminal power is nothing else than the active power of generation. But if anyone were to be formed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> out of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, it is evident that the active power would not be derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. Consequently he would not contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>: even as a hand would have no part in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if it were moved, not by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will, but by some external power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was not in the place of exile until after his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently it is not on account of the place of exile, but on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is transmitted to those to whom his active generation extends.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The flesh does not corrupt the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, except in so far as it is the active principle in generation, as we have stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If a man were to be formed from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, he would have been in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, "by way of bodily <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>" [The expression is <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> (Gen. ad lit. x). Cf. Summa Theologica TP, 31, 6, Reply to Objection 1, but not according to seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above. Therefore he would not contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether if Eve, and not Adam, had sinned, their children would have contracted original sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that if Eve, and not <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, their children would have contracted <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Because we contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> from our parents, in so far as we were once in them, according to the word of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>): "In whom all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>." Now a man pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in his mother as well as in his father. Therefore a man would have contracted <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> from his mother's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as well as from his father's.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if Eve, and not <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, their children would have been born liable to suffering and death, since it is "the mother" that "provides the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in generation" as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (De Gener. Animal. ii, 1,4), when death and liability to suffering are the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> results of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now liability to suffering and the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of dying are punishments of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Therefore if Eve, and not <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, their children would contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 3) that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came upon the Virgin," (of whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to be born without <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>) "purifying her." But this purification would not have been <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, if the infection of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> were not contracted from the mother. Therefore the infection of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is contracted from the mother: so that if Eve had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, her children would have contracted <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, even if <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>): "By one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into this world." Now if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> would have transmitted <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> to her children, he should have said that it entered by two, since both of them <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, or rather that it entered by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, since she <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> first. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is transmitted to the children, not by the mother, but by the father.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The solution of this question is made clear by what has been said. For it has been stated (1) that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is transmitted by the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> in so far as he is the mover in the begetting of his children: wherefore it has been said (4) that if anyone were begotten materially only, of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, they would not contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Now it is evident that in the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, the active principle of generation is from the father, while the mother provides the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, is contracted, not from the mother, but from the father: so that, accordingly, if Eve, and not <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, their children would not contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>: whereas, if <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, and not Eve, had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, they would contract it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The child pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in its father as in its active principle, and in its mother, as in its material and passive principle. Consequently the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Some hold that if Eve, and not <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, their children would be immune from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but would have been subject to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of dying and to other forms of suffering that are a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> result of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which is provided by the mother, not as punishments, but as actual defects. This, however, seems unreasonable. Because, as stated in the I, 97, A1, 2, ad 4, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and impassibility, in the original state, were a result, not of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereby the body was subjected to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so long as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remained subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now privation of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. If, therefore, supposing <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> would not have been transmitted to posterity on account of Eve's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; it is evident that the children would not have been deprived of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and consequently they would not have been liable to suffer and subject to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of dying.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This prevenient purification in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was not needed to hinder the transmission of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, but because it behooved the Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "to shine with the greatest purity" [Cf. <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a>, De Concep. Virg. xviii.]. For nothing is worthy to receive <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> unless it be pure, according to <a href="../bible/psa092.htm#verse5">Psalm 92:5</a>: "Holiness becometh Thy House, O Lord."
