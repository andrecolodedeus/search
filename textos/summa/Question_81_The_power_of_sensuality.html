<h1>Question 81. The power of sensuality</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1081.htm#article1"> Is sensuality only an appetitive power?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1081.htm#article2"> Is it divided into irascible and concupiscible as distinct powers?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1081.htm#article3"> Do the irascible and concupiscible powers obey reason?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether sensuality is only appetitive?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sensuality is not only <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>, but also cognitive. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 12) that "the sensual movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is directed to the bodily senses is common to us and beasts." But the bodily senses belong to the apprehensive powers. Therefore sensuality is a cognitive power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, things which come under one division seem to be of one genus. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xii, 12) divides sensuality against the higher and lower reason, which belong to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore sensuality also is apprehensive.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> sensuality stands in the place of the "serpent." But in the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of our first parents, the serpent presented himself as one giving information and proposing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which belong to the cognitive power. Therefore sensuality is a cognitive power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Sensuality is defined as "the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of things belonging to the body."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The name sensuality seems to be taken from the sensual movement, of which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks (De Trin. xii, 12, 13), just as the name of a power is taken from its act; for instance, sight from seeing. Now the sensual movement is an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> following sensitive apprehension. For the act of the apprehensive power is not so properly called a movement as the act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: since the operation of the apprehensive power is completed in the very fact that the thing apprehended is in the one that apprehends: while the operation of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is completed in the fact that he who desires is borne towards the thing desirable. Therefore the operation of the apprehensive power is likened to rest: whereas the operation of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is rather likened to movement. Wherefore by sensual movement we understand the operation of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power: so that sensuality is the name of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By saying that the sensual movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is directed to the bodily senses, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> does not give us to understand that the bodily senses are included in sensuality, but rather that the movement of sensuality is a certain inclination to the bodily senses, since we desire things which are apprehended through the bodily senses. And thus the bodily senses appertain to sensuality as a preamble.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sensuality is divided against higher and lower reason, as having in common with them the act of movement: for the apprehensive power, to which belong the higher and lower reason, is a motive power; as is <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, to which appertains sensuality.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The serpent not only showed and proposed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also incited to the commission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And in this, sensuality is signified by the serpent.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the sensitive appetite is divided into the irascible and concupiscible as distinct powers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not divided into the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> as distinct powers. For the same power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> regards both sides of a contrariety, as sight regards both black and white, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, 11). But suitable and harmful are contraries. Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power regards what is suitable, while the irascible is concerned with what is harmful, it seems that irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> are the same power in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> regards only what is suitable according to the senses. But such is the object of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power. Therefore there is no sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> differing from the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is in the irascible part: for <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse33">Matthew 13:33</a>: "We ought to have the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in the irascible power." But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is contrary to love, and is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> and irascible are the same powers.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> (Nemesius, De Natura Hominis) and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 12) assign two parts to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, the irascible and the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is one generic power, and is called sensuality; but it is divided into two powers, which are <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>--the irascible and the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>. In order to make this clear, we must observe that in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> corruptible things there is needed an inclination not only to the acquisition of what is suitable and to the avoiding of what is harmful, but also to resistance against corruptive and contrary agencies which are a hindrance to the acquisition of what is suitable, and are productive of harm. For example, fire has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination, not only to rise from a lower position, which is unsuitable to it, towards a higher position which is suitable, but also to resist whatever destroys or hinders its action. Therefore, since the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is an inclination following sensitive apprehension, as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is an inclination following the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form, there must needs be in the sensitive part two <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers--one through which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is simply inclined to seek what is suitable, according to the senses, and to fly from what is hurtful, and this is called the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>: and another, whereby an animal resists these attacks that hinder what is suitable, and inflict harm, and this is called the irascible. Whence we say that its object is something arduous, because its tendency is to overcome and rise above obstacles. Now these two are not to be reduced to one principle: for sometimes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> busies itself with unpleasant things, against the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, in order that, following the impulse of the irascible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, it may fight against obstacles. Wherefore also the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> counteract the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, on being aroused, diminishes <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> being roused, diminishes <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> in many cases. This is clear also from the fact that the irascible is, as it were, the champion and defender of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> when it rises up against what hinders the acquisition of the suitable things which the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> desires, or against what inflicts harm, from which the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> flies. And for this reason all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> rise from the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> and terminate in them; for instance, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> rises from sadness, and having wrought vengeance, terminates in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. For this reason also the quarrels of animals are about things <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>--namely, food and sex, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says [De Animal. Histor. viii.].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power regards both what is suitable and what is unsuitable. But the object of the irascible power is to resist the onslaught of the unsuitable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As in the apprehensive powers of the sensitive part there is an estimative power, which perceives those things which do not impress the senses, as we have said above (Question 78, Article 2); so also in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> there is a certain <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power which regards something as suitable, not because it pleases the senses, but because it is useful to the animal for self-defense: and this is the irascible power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hatred belongs simply to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: but by reason of the strife which arises from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, it may belong to the irascible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the irascible and concupiscible appetites obey reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> appetites do not obey reason. For irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> are parts of sensuality. But sensuality does not obey reason, wherefore it is signified by the serpent, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 12,13). Therefore the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> appetites do not obey reason.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what obeys a certain thing does not resist it. But the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> appetites resist reason: according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans 7:23</a>): "I see another <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in my members fighting against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of my mind." Therefore the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> appetites do not obey reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is inferior to the rational part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so also is the sensitive power. But the sensitive part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not obey reason: for we neither hear nor see just when we wish. Therefore, in like manner, neither do the powers of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, the irascible and concupscible, obey reason.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 12) that "the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is obedient and amenable to reason is divided into <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In two ways the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers obey the higher part, in which are the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or reason, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; first, as to reason, secondly as to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. They obey the reason in their own acts, because in other animals the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> moved by the estimative power; for instance, a sheep, esteeming the wolf as an enemy, is afraid. In <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the estimative power, as we have said above (Question 78, Article 4), is replaced by the cogitative power, which is called by some 'the particular reason,' because it compares <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> intentions. Wherefore in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> moved by this particular reason. But this same particular reason is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> guided and moved according to the universal reason: wherefore in syllogistic matters particular conclusions are drawn from universal propositions. Therefore it is clear that the universal reason directs the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is divided into <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> and irascible; and this <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> obeys it. But because to draw particular conclusions from universal principles is not the work of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as such, but of the reason: hence it is that the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> are said to obey the reason rather than to obey the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Anyone can experience this in himself: for by applying certain universal considerations, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or fear or the like may be modified or excited.

<p>To the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> also is the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> subject in execution, which is accomplished by the motive power. For in other animals movement follows at once the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> and irascible appetites: for instance, the sheep, fearing the wolf, flees at once, because it has no superior counteracting <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not moved at once, according to the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> appetites: but he awaits the command of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the superior <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. For wherever there is order among a number of motive powers, the second only moves by virtue of the first: wherefore the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not sufficient to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> movement, unless the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> consents. And this is what the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 11), that "the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> moves the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as the higher sphere moves the lower." In this way, therefore, the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> are subject to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sensuality is signified by the serpent, in what is proper to it as a sensitive power. But the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers denominate the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> rather on the part of the act, to which they are led by the reason, as we have said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 2): "We observe in an animal a despotic and a politic principle: for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dominates the body by a despotic power; but the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> dominates the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> by a politic and royal power." For a power is called despotic whereby a man rules his slaves, who have not the right to resist in any way the orders of the one that commands them, since they have nothing of their own. But that power is called politic and royal by which a man rules over free subjects, who, though subject to the government of the ruler, have nevertheless something of their own, by reason of which they can resist the orders of him who commands. And so, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is said to rule the body by a despotic power, because the members of the body cannot in any way resist the sway of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but at the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> command both hand and foot, and whatever member is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> moved by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> movement, are moved at once. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or reason is said to rule the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> by a politic power: because the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> has something of its own, by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereof it can resist the commands of reason. For the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> moved, not only by the estimative power in other animals, and in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the cogitative power which the universal reason guides, but also by the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and sense. Whence it is that we experience that the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers do resist reason, inasmuch as we sense or <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> something pleasant, which reason forbids, or unpleasant, which reason commands. And so from the fact that the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> resist reason in something, we must not conclude that they do not obey.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The exterior senses require for action exterior sensible things, whereby they are affected, and the presence of which is not ruled by reason. But the interior powers, both <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> and apprehensive, do not require exterior things. Therefore they are subject to the command of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which can not only incite or modify the affections of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, but can also form the phantasms of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>.
