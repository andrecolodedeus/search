<h1>Question 81. The quality of those who rise again</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5081.htm#article1"> Will all rise again in the youthful age?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5081.htm#article2"> Will they be of equal stature?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5081.htm#article3"> Will all be of the same sex?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5081.htm#article4"> Will they rise again to the animal life?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether all will rise again of the same age?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all will not rise again of the same, namely the youthful age. Because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will take nothing pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfection from those who rise again, especially from the blessed. Now age pertains to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since old age is the age that demands reverence. Therefore the old will not rise again of a youthful age.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, age is reckoned according to the length of past time. Now it is impossible for past time not to have passed. Therefore it is impossible for those who were of greater age to be brought back to a youthful age.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which belonged most to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> will especially rise again in him. Now the sooner a thing was in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the more would it seem to have belonged to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because in the end, through the strength of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> being weakened the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is likened to watery wine according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Gener. i). Therefore if all are to rise again of the same age, it is more fitting that they should rise again in the age of childhood.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians 4:13</a>): "Until we all meet . . . unto a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unto the measure of the age of the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rose again</a> of youthful age, which begins about the age of thirty years, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxii). Therefore others also will rise again of a youthful age.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will rise again at the most perfect stage of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is at the most perfect stage in the age of youth. Therefore all will rise again of that age.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Man will rise again without any defect of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> founded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> without a defect, even so will He restore it without defect. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has a twofold defect. First, because it has not yet attained to its ultimate perfection. Secondly, because it has already gone back from its ultimate perfection. The first defect is found in children, the second in the aged: and consequently in each of these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> will be brought by the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> to the state of its ultimate perfection which is in the youthful age, at which the movement of growth terminates, and from which the movement of decrease begins.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Old age calls for reverence, not on account of the state of the body which is at fault; but on account of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> wisdom which is taken for granted on account of its being advanced in years. Wherefore in the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> there will remain the reverence due to old age on account of the fulness of Divine wisdom which will be in them, but the defect of old age will not be in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We speak of age not as regards the number of years, but as regards the state which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body acquires from years. Hence <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is said to have been formed in the youthful age on account of the particular <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of body which he had at the first day of his formation. Thus the argument is not to the point.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The strength of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is said to be more perfect in a child than in a young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as regards the ability to transform nourishment in a certain way, even as it is more perfect in the seed than in the mature <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. In youth, however, it is more perfect as regards the term of completion. Wherefore that which belonged principally to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> will be brought to that perfection which it has in the age of youth, and not to that perfection which it has in the age of a child, wherein the humors have not yet reached their ultimate disposition.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether all will rise again of the same stature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all will rise again of the same stature. For just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is measured by dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, so is he by the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of time will be reduced to the same measure in all, since all will rise again of the same age. Therefore the dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> will also be reduced to the same measure in all, so that all will rise again of the same stature.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 4) that "all things in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> have a certain limit end measure of size and growth." Now this limitation can only arise by virtue of the form, with which the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> as well as all the other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> ought to agree. Therefore since all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have the same specific form, there should be the same measure of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in respect of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in all, unless an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> should occur. But the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> will be set right at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. Therefore all will rise again of the same stature.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it will be impossible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in rising again to be of a <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power which first formed his body; for otherwise those who could not be brought to a greater <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> by the power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> will never rise again of a greater <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore that <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> must needs be proportionate to the power which will restore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body by the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from which it is restored. Now the selfsame, namely the Divine, power will restore all bodies; and all the ashes from which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies will be restored are equally disposed to receive the action of that power. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> will bring them to the same <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>: and so the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> results from each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> will not be altered at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. Therefore neither will its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But all are not of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Therefore all will not rise again of the same stature.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> will be restored by <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> or unto punishment. But there will not be the same <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> or punishment in all those who rise again. Neither therefore will there be the same <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of stature.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> At the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> will be restored not only in the self-same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> but also in the selfsame <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>: and consequently we must observe in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> what is requisite not only to the specific but also to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has a certain <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> which it neither exceeds nor fails without <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and yet this <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> has certain degrees of latitude and is not to be attached to one fixed measure; and each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> aims at some degree of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> befitting his <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> within the bounds of that latitude, and reaches it at the end of his growth, if there has been no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in the working of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, resulting in the addition of something to or the subtraction of something from the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>: the measure whereof is gauged according to the proportion of heat as expanding, and of humidity as expansive, in point of which all are not of the same power. Therefore all will not rise again of the same <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but each one will rise again of that <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> which would have been his at the end of his growth if <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> had not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> or failed: and the Divine power will subtract or supply what was excessive or lacking in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It has already been explained (1, ad 2) that all are said to rise again of the same age, not as though the same length of time were befitting to each one, but because the same state of perfection will be in all, which state is indifferent to a great or small <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of a particular <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> corresponds not only to the form of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but also to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>: wherefore the conclusion does not follow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of those who will be raised from the dead is not proportionate to the restoring power, because the latter does not belong to the power of the body--nor to the ashes, as to the state in which they are before the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>--but to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> had at first. Nevertheless if the formative power on account of some defect was unable to effect the due <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> that is befitting to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, the Divine power will supply the defect at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, as in dwarfs, and in like manner in those who by immoderate size have exceeded the due bounds of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether all will rise again of the male sex?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all will rise again of the male sex. For it is written (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians 4:13</a>) that we shall all meet "unto a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," etc. Therefore there will be none but the male sex.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the world to come all pre-eminence will cease, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes on <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> will rise again not in the female but in the male sex.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is produced incidentally and beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> will not rise again, since all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> will be removed at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. Now the female sex is produced beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, through a fault in the formative power of the seed, which is unable to bring the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the fetus to the male form: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima xvi, i.e. De Generat. Animal. ii) that "the female is a misbegotten male." Therefore the female sex will not rise again.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxii): "Those are wiser, seemingly, who <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that both sexes will rise again."

<p>Further, at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will restore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to what He made him at the creation. Now He made <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> rib (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse22">Genesis 2:22</a>). Therefore He will also restore the female sex at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as, considering the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, a different <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is due to different men, so also, considering the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, a different sex is due to different men. Moreover, this same diversity is becoming to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, the different degrees whereof are filled by this very difference of sex and <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Wherefore just as men will rise again of various stature, so will they rise again of different sex. And though there be difference of sex there will be no shame in seeing one another, since there will no <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> to invite them to shameful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of shame.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When it is said: We shall all meet "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> unto a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," this refers not to the male sex but to the strength of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which will be in all, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Woman</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on account of the frailty of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as regards both vigor of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and strength of body. After the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, however, the difference in those points will be not on account of the difference of sex, but by reason of the difference of merits. Hence the conclusion does not follow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the begetting of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is beside the intention of a particular <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it is in the intention of universal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which requires both sexes for the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Nor will any defect result from sex as stated above (ad 2).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether all will rise again to animal life so as to exercise the functions of nutrition and generation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that they will <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again</a> to the animal life, or in other words that they will make use of the acts of the nutritive and generative powers. For <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a> will be conformed to <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have ate after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> (<a href="../bible/joh021.htm">John 21</a>; <a href="../bible/luk024.htm">Luke 24</a>). Therefore, after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> men will eat, and in like manner beget.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the distinction of sexes is directed to generation; and in like manner the instruments which serve the nutritive power are directed to eating. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will rise again with all these. Therefore he will exercise the acts of the generative and nutritive powers.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will be beatified both in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and in body. Now beatitude or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 7), consists in a perfect operation. Therefore it must needs be that all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and all the members should have their respective acts after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. And so the same conclusion follows as above.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> there will be perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the blessed. Now such a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> includes all pleasures, since "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>" according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> is "a state rendered perfect by the accumulation of all goods" (De Consol. iii), and the perfect is that which lacks nothing. Since then there is much pleasure in the act of the generative and nutritive powers it would seem that such acts belonging to animal life will be in the blessed, and much more in others, who will have less <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> bodies.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>): "In the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> they shall neither marry nor be <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>."

<p>Further, generation is directed to supply the defect resulting from death, and to the multiplication of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>: and eating is directed to make up for waste, and to increase <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But in the state of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> will already have the number of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> preordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since generation will continue up to that point. In like manner each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will rise again in due <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; neither will death be any more, nor any waste affect the parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore the acts of the generative and nutritive powers would be void of purpose.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will not be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on account of his primary perfection, which consists in the integrity of those things that belong to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can attain to this in his present state of life by the action of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> regards the attainment of his ultimate perfection, which consists in his reaching his ultimate end. Consequently those <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> operations which are directed to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or preserve the primary perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> will not be in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>: such are the actions of the animal life in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the action of the elements on one another, and the movement of the heavens; wherefore all these will cease at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. And since to eat, drink, sleep, beget, pertain to the animal life, being directed to the primary perfection of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it follows that they will not be in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> partook of that meal, His eating was an act, not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> as though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> needed food after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, but of power, so as to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that He had resumed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which He had in that state wherein He ate and drank with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. There will be no need of such <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">general resurrection</a>, since it will be evident to all. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have ate by dispensation in the sense in which lawyers say that a "dispensation is a relaxation of the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>": because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> made an exception to that which is common to those who rise again (namely not to partake of food) for the aforesaid motive. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The distinction of sexes and the difference of members will be for the restoration of the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> both in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Hence it does not follow that they are without purpose, although they lack their animal operations.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The aforesaid operations do not belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as also the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. x, 7), wherefore the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body does not consist therein. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body will be glorified by an overflow from the <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inasmuch as the body will be subject to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 12, x, 5), the pleasures of the body are medicinal, because they are applied to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for the removal of weariness; or again, they are unhealthy, in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> indulges in those pleasures inordinately, as though they were real pleasures: just as a man whose taste is vitiated delights in things which are not delightful to the healthy. Consequently it does not follow that such pleasures as these belong to the perfection of beatitude, as the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Turks</a> maintain, and certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">Chiliasts</a> asserted; who, moreover, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher's</a> teaching, would seem to have an unhealthy <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, since according to him none but <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures are pleasures simply, and to be sought for their own sake: wherefore these alone are requisite for beatitude.
