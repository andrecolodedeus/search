<h1>Question 81. The use which Christ made of this sacrament at its institution</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4081.htm#article1"> Did Christ receive His own body and blood?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4081.htm#article2"> Did He give it to Judas?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4081.htm#article3"> What kind of body did He receive or give, namely, was it passible or impassible?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4081.htm#article4"> What would have been the condition of Christ's body under this sacrament, if it had been reserved or consecrated during the three days He lay dead?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ received His own body and blood?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not receive His own body and blood, because nothing ought to be asserted of either <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> doings or sayings, which is not handed down by the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a>. But it is not narrated in the gospels that He ate His own body or drank His own blood. Therefore we must not assert this as a fact.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing can be within itself except perchance by reason of its parts, for instance. as one part is in another, as is stated in Phys. iv. But what is eaten and drunk is in the eater and drinker. Therefore, since the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is under each <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it seems impossible for Him to have received this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the receiving of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is twofold, namely, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and sacramental. But the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> was unsuitable for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as He derived no benefit from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. and in consequence so was the sacramental, since it is imperfect without the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, as was observed above (Question 80, Article 1). Consequently, in no way did Christ partake of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ad Hedib., Ep. xxx), "The Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Himself the guest and banquet, is both the partaker and what is eaten."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> during the supper gave His body and blood to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but did not partake of it Himself. But this seems improbable. Because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself was the first to fulfill what He required others to observe: hence He willed first to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> when imposing <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> upon others: as we read in <a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse1">Acts 1:1</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> began to do and to teach." Hence He first of all took His own body and blood, and afterwards gave it to be taken by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And hence the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> upon <a href="../bible/rut003.htm#verse7">Ruth 3:7</a>, "When he had eaten and drunk, says: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ate and drank at the supper, when He gave to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the sacrament of His body and blood. Hence, 'because the children partook [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'are partakers' (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse14">Hebrews 2:14</a>)] of His flesh and blood, He also hath been partaker in the same.'"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> how <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "took the bread . . . and the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>"; but it is not to be understood that He took them merely into His hands, as some say. but that He took them in the same way as He gave them to others to take. Hence when He said to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, "Take ye and eat," and again, "Take ye and drink," it is to be understood that He Himself, in taking it, both ate and drank. Hence some have composed this rhyme: <blockquote> "The King at supper sits,<br> The twelve as guests He greets,<br> Clasping Himself in His hands,<br> The food Himself now eats."<br> </blockquote>

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As was said above (Question 76, Article 5), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as contained under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> stands in relation to place, not according to His own dimensions, but according to the dimensions of the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; so that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is Himself in every place where those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are. And because the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> were able to be both in the hands and the mouth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could be in both His hands and mouth. Now this could not come to pass were His relation to place to be according to His proper dimensions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As was stated above (79, 1, ad 2), the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not merely an increase of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but furthermore a certain actual delectation of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sweetness. But although <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was not increased in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through His receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, yet He had a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> delectation from the new institution of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Hence He Himself said (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse15">Luke 22:15</a>): "With desire I have desired to eat this Pasch with you," which words <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> explains of the new <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which He gave to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And therefore He ate it both spiritually and sacramentally, inasmuch as He received His own body under the sacrament which sacrament of His own body He both understood and prepared; yet differently from others who partake of it both sacramentally and spiritually, for these receive an increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and they have need of the sacramental signs for perceiving its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ gave His body to Judas?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not give His body to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>. Because, as we read (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse29">Matthew 26:29</a>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, after giving His body and blood to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, said to them: "I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of My Father." From this it appears that those to whom He had given His body and blood were to drink of it again with Him. But <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> did not drink of it afterwards with Him. Therefore he did not receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and blood with the other <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what the Lord commanded, He Himself fulfilled, as is said in <a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse1">Acts 1:1</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> began to do and to teach." But He gave the command (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew 7:6</a>): "Give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to dogs." Therefore, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> to be a sinner, seemingly He did not give him His body and blood.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is distinctly related (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse26">John 13:26</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave dipped bread to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>. Consequently, if He gave His body to him, it appears that He gave it him in the morsel, especially since we read (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse26">John 13:26</a>) that "after the morsel, Satan entered into him." And on this passage <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxii in Joan.): "From this we learn how we should beware of receiving a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing in an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> way . . . For if he be 'chastised' who does 'not discern,' i.e. distinguish, the body of the Lord from other meats, how must he be 'condemned' who, feigning himself a friend, comes to His table a foe?" But (<a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>) did not receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> body with the dipped morsel; thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse26">John 13:26</a>, "When He had dipped the bread, He gave it to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, the son of Simon the Iscariot [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, the son of Simon," says (Tract. lxii in Joan.): "<a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> did not receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body then, as some think who read carelessly." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> did not receive the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. lxxxii in Matth.): "<a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> was not converted while partaking of the sacred mysteries: hence on both sides his crime becomes the more heinous, both because imbued with such a purpose he approached the mysteries, and because he became none the better for approaching, neither from fear, nor from the benefit received, nor from the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> conferred on him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a>, in <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse17">Matthew 26:17</a>, held that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not give His body and blood to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>. And this would have been quite proper, if the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> be considered. But since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to serve us as a pattern of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, it was not in keeping with His teaching authority to sever <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, a hidden sinner, from Communion with the others without an accuser and evident <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. lest the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> might have an example for doing the like, and lest <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> himself being exasperated might take occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Therefore, it remains to be said that <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> received <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> body and blood with the other <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii), and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. lxii in Joan.).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This is <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary's</a> argument, to show that <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> did not receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body. But it is not cogent; because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is speaking to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, from whose company <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> separated himself: and it was not <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> that excluded him. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for His part drinks the wine even with <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; but <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> himself repudiated this banquet.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but it was unknown to Him, after the manner in which men <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not repel <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> from Communion; so as to furnish an example that such secret sinners are not to be repelled by other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> did not receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body in the dipped bread; he received mere bread. Yet as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (Tract. lxii in Joan.), "perchance the feigning of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> is denoted by the dipping of the bread; just as some things are dipped to be dyed. If, however, the dipping signifies here anything <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (for instance, the sweetness of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, since bread is rendered more savory by being dipped), "then, not undeservedly, did condemnation follow his ingratitude for that same <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." And owing to that ingratitude, "what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> became <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to him, as happens to them who receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body unworthily."

<p>And as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxii in Joan.), "it must be understood that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> had already distributed the sacrament of His body and blood to all His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, among whom was <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> also, as Luke narrates: and after that, we came to this, where, according to the relation of John, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, by dipping and handing the morsel, does most openly declare His betrayer."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ received and gave to the disciples His impassible body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> both received and gave to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> His impassible body. Because on <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse2">Matthew 17:2</a>, "He was transfigured before them," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "He gave to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> at the supper that body which He had through <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but neither mortal nor passible." And again, on <a href="../bible/lev002.htm#verse5">Leviticus 2:5</a>, "if thy oblation be from the frying-pan," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "The Cross mightier than all things made <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh fit for being eaten, which before the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> did not seem so suited." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave His body as suited for eating. Therefore He gave it just as it was after the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, that is, impassible and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every passible body suffers by contact and by being eaten. Consequently, if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was passible, it would have suffered both from contact and from being eaten by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the sacramental words now spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are not more powerful than when uttered by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. But now by virtue of the sacramental words it is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> impassible and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> body which is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> upon the altar. Therefore, much more so was it then.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> says (De Sacr. Alt. Myst. iv), "He bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> His body such as it was." But then He had a passible and a mortal body. Therefore, He gave a passible and mortal body to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of Saint Victor</a> (<a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, De Sacr. Alt. Myst. iv), maintained, that before the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, Christ assumed at various times the four properties of a glorified body --namely, subtlety in His birth, when He came forth from the closed womb of the Virgin; agility, when He walked dryshod upon the sea; clarity, in the <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">Transfiguration</a>; and impassibility at the Last Supper, when He gave His body to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to be eaten. And according to this He gave His body in an impassible and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.

<p>But whatever may be the case touching the other <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, concerning which we have already stated what should be held (28, 2, ad 3; 45, 2), nevertheless the above opinion regarding impassibility is inadmissible. For it is manifest that the same body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which was then seen by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in its own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, was received by them under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But as seen in its own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> it was not impassible; nay more, it was ready for the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Therefore, neither was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body impassible when given under the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>Yet there was present in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, in an impassible manner, that which was passible of itself; just as that was there invisibly which of itself was visible. For as sight requires that the body seen be in contact with the adjacent medium of sight, so does passion require contact of the suffering body with the active agents. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, according as it is under the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (1, ad 2; 76, 5), is not compared with its surroundings through the intermediary of its own dimensions, whereby bodies touch each other, but through the dimensions of the bread and wine; consequently, it is those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which are acted upon and are seen, but not <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said not to have given His mortal and passible body at the supper, because He did not give it in mortal and passible fashion. But the Cross made His flesh adapted for eating, inasmuch as this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> represents <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument would hold, if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, as it was passible, were also present in a passible manner in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 76, Article 4), the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body are in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by real concomitance, but not by the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body comes to be there. And therefore the power of the sacramental words extends to this, that the body, i.e. Christ's, is under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, whatever <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> really <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in it.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether, if this sacrament had been reserved in a pyx, or consecrated at the moment of Christ's death by one of the apostles, Christ Himself would have died there?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that if this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> had been reserved in a pyx at the moment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, or had then been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by one of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would not have died there. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death happened through His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. But even then He was in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in an impassible manner. Therefore, He could not die in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, His blood was separated from the body. But His flesh and blood are together in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore He could not die in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, death ensues from the separation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body. But both the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are contained in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not die in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who was upon the cross would have been in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But He died upon the cross. Therefore, if this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> had been reserved, He would have died therein.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is substantially the same in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as in its proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but not after the same fashion; because in its proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> it comes in contact with surrounding bodies by its own dimensions: but it does not do so as it is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). And therefore, all that belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as He is in Himself, can be attributed to Him both in His proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and as He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the sacrament; such as to live, to die, to grieve, to be animate or inanimate, and the like; while all that belongs to Him in relation to outward bodies, can be attributed to Him as He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in His proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but not as He is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; such as to be mocked, to be spat upon, to be crucified, to be scourged, and the rest. Hence some have composed this verse: <blockquote> "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> can grieve beneath the sacramental veils <br>But cannot feel the piercing of the thorns and nails." </blockquote>

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As was stated above, suffering belongs to a body that suffers in respect of some extrinsic body. And therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, cannot suffer; yet He can die.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As was said above (Question 76, Article 2), in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of bread, while His blood is under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of wine. But now that His blood is not really separated from His body; by real concomitance, both His blood is present with the body under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the bread, and His body together with the blood under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the wine. But at the time when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered, when His blood was really separated from His body, if this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, then the body only would have been present under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the bread, and the blood only under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the wine.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As was observed above (76, 1, ad 1), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by real concomitance; because it is not without the body: but it is not there in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. And therefore, if this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> then, or reserved, when His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was really separated from His body, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would not have been under this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not from any defect in the form of the words, but owing to the different dispositions of the thing contained.
