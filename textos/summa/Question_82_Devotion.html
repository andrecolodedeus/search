<h1>Question 82. Devotion</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3082.htm#article1"> Is devotion a special act?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3082.htm#article2"> Is it an act of religion?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3082.htm#article3"> What is the cause of devotion?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3082.htm#article4"> Its effect?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether devotion is a special act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that devotion is not a special act. That which qualifies other acts is seemingly not a special act. Now devotion seems to qualify other acts, for it is written (<a href="../bible/2ch029.htm#verse31">2 Chronicles 29:31</a>): "All the multitude offered victims, and praises, and holocausts with a devout mind." Therefore devotion is not a special act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no special kind of act is common to various genera of acts. But devotion is common to various genera of acts, namely, corporal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> acts: for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to meditate devoutly and to genuflect devoutly. Therefore devotion is not a special act.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every special act belongs either to an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> or to a cognitive <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or power. But devotion belongs to neither, as may be seen by going through the various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of acts of either faculty, as enumerated above (I, 78, seqq.; I-II, 23, 4). Therefore devotion is not a special act.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Merits are acquired by acts as stated above (I-II, 21, A034). But devotion has a special reason for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Therefore devotion is a special act.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Devotion is derived from "devote" [The <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> 'devovere' means 'to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>']; wherefore those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are said to be "devout" who, in a way, devote themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so as to subject themselves wholly to Him. Hence in olden times among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> a devotee was one who vowed to his <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to suffer death for the safety of his army, as Livy relates of the two Decii (Decad. I, viii, 9; x, 28). Hence devotion is apparently nothing else but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to give oneself readily to things concerning the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/exo035.htm#verse20">Exodus 35:20-21</a>) that "the multitude of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> . . . offered first-fruits to the Lord with a most ready and devout mind." Now it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to do readily what concerns the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a special kind of act. Therefore devotion is a special act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The mover prescribes the mode of the movement of the thing moved. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to their acts, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in so far as it regards the end, moves both itself and whatever is directed to the end, as stated above (I-II, 09, 3). Wherefore, since devotion is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> whereby a man offers himself for the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the last end, it follows that devotion prescribes the mode to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, whether they be acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> itself about things directed to the end, or acts of the other powers that are moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Devotion is to be found in various genera of acts, not as a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of those genera, but as the motion of the mover is found virtually in the movements of the things moved.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Devotion is an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether devotion is an act of religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that devotion is not an act of religion. Devotion, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), consists in giving oneself up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But this is done chiefly by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv) "the Divine love produces <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, for it takes the lover away from himself and gives him to the beloved." Therefore devotion is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than of religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> precedes religion; and devotion seems to precede <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; since, in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is represented by fire, while devotion is signified by fatness which is the material of fire [<a href="../bible/son008.htm#verse6">Canticles 8:6</a>; <a href="../bible/psa052.htm#verse6">Psalm 52:6</a>. Therefore devotion is not an act of religion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by religion <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, as stated above (Question 81, Article 1). But devotion is directed also to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; for we speak of people being devout to certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, and subjects are said to be devoted to their masters; thus Pope Leo says [Serm. viii, De Pass. Dom.] that the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> "out of devotion to the Roman laws," said: "We have no king but Caesar." Therefore devotion is not an act of religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Devotion is derived from "devovere," as stated (1).

<p>But a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is an act of religion. Therefore devotion is also an act of religion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It belongs to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to will to do something, and to have the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> ready to do it, because both acts have the same object. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1): "It is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> whereby men both will end do just actions." Now it is evident that to do what pertains to the worship or service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, belongs properly to religion, as stated above (<a href="#81">Article 81</a>). Wherefore it belongs to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to have the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> ready to do such things, and this is to be devout. Hence it is evident that devotion is an act of religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It belongs immediately to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should give himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, adhering to Him by a union of the spirit; but it belongs immediately to religion, and, through the medium of religion, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is the principle of religion, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should give himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for certain works of Divine worship.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Bodily fatness is produced by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat in the process of digestion, and at the same time the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat thrives, as it were, on this fatness. On like manner <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> both <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> devotion (inasmuch as love makes one ready to serve one's friend) and feeds on devotion. Even so all friendship is safeguarded and increased by the practice and consideration of friendly <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Devotion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ones, dead or living, does not terminate in them, but passes on to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in so far as we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His servants. But the devotion of subjects to their temporal masters is of another kind, just as service of a temporal master differs from the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether contemplation or meditation is the cause of devotion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> or meditation is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of devotion. No <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> hinders its effect. But subtle considerations about abstract matters are often a hindrance to devotion. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> or meditation is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of devotion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> were the proper and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of devotion, the higher objects of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> would arouse greater devotion. But the contrary is the case: since frequently we are urged to greater devotion by considering <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and other mysteries of His humanity than by considering the greatness of His Godhead. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is not the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of devotion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> were the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of devotion, it would follow that those who are most apt for <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, are also most apt for devotion. Yet the contrary is to be noticed, for devotion is frequently found in men of simplicity and members of the female sex, who are defective in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is not the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of devotion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa038.htm#verse4">Psalm 38:4</a>): "In my meditation a fire shall flame out." But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fire <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> devotion. Therefore meditation is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of devotion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The extrinsic and chief <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of devotion is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of Whom <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse55">Luke 9:55</a>, says that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> calls whom He deigns to call, and whom He wills He makes religious: the profane Samaritans, had He so willed, He would have made devout." But the intrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on our part must needs be meditation or <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. For it was stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) that devotion is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to the effect that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> surrenders himself readily to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now every act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> proceeds from some consideration, since the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> understood. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ix, 12; xv, 23) that "the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> arises from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>." Consequently meditation must needs be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of devotion, in so far as through meditation <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> conceives the thought of surrendering himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service. Ondeed a twofold consideration leads him thereto. The one is the consideration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> kindness, according to <a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse28">Psalm 72:28</a>, "It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to adhere to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to put my hope in the Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": and this consideration wakens love ['Dilectio,' the interior <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; cf. 27] which is the proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of devotion. The other consideration is that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> own shortcomings, on account of which he needs to lean on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa120.htm#verse1">Psalm 120:1-2</a>, "I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains, from whence help shall come to me: my help is from the Lord, Who made <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth"; and this consideration shuts out presumption whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is hindered from submitting to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because he leans on His strength.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The consideration of such things as are of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to awaken our love ['Dilectio,' the interior <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; cf. 27] of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> devotion; whereas the consideration of foreign matters that distract the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from such things is a hindrance to devotion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Matters concerning the Godhead are, in themselves, the strongest incentive to love ['dilectio,' the interior <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; cf. 27] and consequently to devotion, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely lovable. Yet such is the weakness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind that it needs a guiding hand, not only to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but also to the love of Divine things by means of certain sensible objects <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us. Chief among these is the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to the words of the Preface [Preface for Christmastide], "that through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> visibly, we may be caught up to the love of things invisible." Wherefore matters relating to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity are the chief incentive to devotion, leading us thither as a guiding hand, although devotion itself has for its object matters concerning the Godhead.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Science and anything else conducive to greatness, is to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> an occasion of self-confidence, so that he does not wholly surrender himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The result is that such like things sometimes occasion a hindrance to devotion; while in simple <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> devotion abounds by repressing <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. If, however, a man perfectly submits to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his science or any other perfection, by this very fact his devotion is increased.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether joy is an effect of devotion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is not an effect of devotion. As stated above (3, ad 2), <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is the chief incentive to devotion.

<p>But the consideration thereof <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an affliction of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to <a href="../bible/lam003.htm#verse19">Lamentations 3:19</a>, "Remember my <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> . . . the wormwood and the gall," which refers to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, and afterwards (<a href="../bible/lam003.htm#verse20">Lamentations 3:20</a>) it is said: "I will be mindful and remember, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall languish within me." Therefore delight or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is not the effect of devotion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, devotion consists chiefly in an interior sacrifice of the spirit. But it is written (<a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse19">Psalm 50:19</a>): "A sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an afflicted spirit." Therefore affliction is the effect of devotion rather than gladness or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> says (De Homine xii) [Orat. funebr. de Placilla Imp.] that "just as laughter proceeds from <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, so tears and groans are signs of sorrow." But devotion makes some people shed tears. Therefore gladness or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is not the effect of devotion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We say in the <a href="../cathen/04103a.htm">Collect</a> [Thursday after fourth Sunday of Lent]: "That we who are punished by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> may be comforted by a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> devotion."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The direct and principal effect of devotion is the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, though sorrow is its secondary and indirect effect. For it has been stated (3) that devotion is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a twofold consideration: chiefly by the consideration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, because this consideration belongs to the term, as it were, of the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in surrendering itself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the direct result of this consideration is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa076.htm#verse4">Psalm 76:4</a>, "I remembered <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was delighted"; but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> this consideration <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a certain sorrow in those who do not yet enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> fully, according to <a href="../bible/psa041.htm#verse3">Psalm 41:3</a>, "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hath thirsted after the strong living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and afterwards it is said (<a href="../bible/psa041.htm#verse4">Psalm 41:4</a>): "My tears have been my bread," etc. Secondarily devotion is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> as stated (3), by the consideration of one's own failings; for this consideration regards the term from which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> withdraws by the movement of his devout will, in that he trusts not in himself, but subjects himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This consideration has an opposite tendency to the first: for it is of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sorrow directly (when one thinks over one's own failings), and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, namely, through hope of the Divine assistance. It is accordingly evident that the first and direct effect of devotion is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, while the secondary and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> effect is that "sorrow which is according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" [<a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the consideration of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> there is something that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow, namely, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> defect, the removal of which made it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to suffer [<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse25">Luke 24:25</a>; and there is something that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> loving-kindness to us in giving us such a deliverance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The spirit which on the one hand is afflicted on account of the defects of the present life, on the other hand is rejoiced, by the consideration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and by the hope of the Divine help.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Tears are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> not only through sorrow, but also through a certain tenderness of the affections, especially when one considers something that gives <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> mixed with pain. Thus men are wont to shed tears through a sentiment of piety, when they recover their children or dear friends, whom they thought to have lost. On this way tears arise from devotion.
