<h1>Question 82. Original sin, as to its essence</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2082.htm#article1"> Is original sin a habit?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2082.htm#article2"> Is there but one original sin in each man?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2082.htm#article3"> Is original sin concupiscence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2082.htm#article4"> Is original sin equally in all?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether original sin is a habit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is the absence of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> states (De Concep. Virg. ii, iii, xxvi), so that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is a privation. But privation is opposed to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of fault more than <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, in so far as it is more <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a fault, else it would follow that a man while asleep, would be guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore no original <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a fault.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> act always precedes <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not infused, but acquired. Now <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not preceded by an act. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book on the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of infants (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i, 39) that on account of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> little children have the aptitude of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> though they have not the act. Now aptitude denotes some kind of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (49, 4; 50, 1), <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is twofold. The first is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby power is inclined to an act: thus science and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are called <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. In this way <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. The second kind of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is the disposition of a complex <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereby that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is well or ill disposed to something, chiefly when such a disposition has become like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as in the case of sickness or health. In this sense <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For it is an inordinate disposition, arising from the destruction of the harmony which was <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, even as bodily sickness is an inordinate disposition of the body, by reason of the destruction of that equilibrium which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to health. Hence it is that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is called the "languor of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" [Cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, In Ps. 118, serm. iii].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As bodily sickness is partly a privation, in so far as it denotes the destruction of the equilibrium of health, and partly something positive, viz. the very humors that are inordinately disposed, so too <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> denotes the privation of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and besides this, the inordinate disposition of the parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently it is not a pure privation, but a corrupt <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an inordinateness of an act: whereas <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, being the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is an inordinate disposition of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and has the character of fault through being transmitted from our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, as stated above (Question 81, Article 1). Now this inordinate disposition of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, whereas the inordinate disposition of an act is not: and for this reason <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> can be a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, whereas actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This objection considers the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which inclines a power to an act: but <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not this kind of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Nevertheless a certain inclination to an inordinate act does follow from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, not directly, but indirectly, viz. by the removal of the obstacle, i.e. original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which hindered inordinate movements: just as an inclination to inordinate bodily movements results indirectly from bodily sickness. Nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to says that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> "infused," or a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> "acquired" (except by the act of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, but not by our own act): but it is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> "inborn" due to our corrupt origin.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there are several original sins in one man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are many <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sins</a> in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse7">Psalm 1:7</a>): "Behold I was conceived in iniquities, and in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> did my mother conceive me." But the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in which a man is conceived is <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Therefore there are several <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sins</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one and the same <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> does not incline its subject to contraries: since the inclination of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is like that of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which tends to one thing. Now <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, even in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inclines to various and contrary <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; but several.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> infects every part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now the different parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are different subjects of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as shown above (<a href="#74">Article 74</a>). Since then one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be in different subjects, it seems that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not one but several.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John 1:29</a>): "Behold the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, behold Him Who taketh away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world": and the reason for the employment of the singular is that the "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world" is <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds this passage.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is one <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Two reasons may be assigned for this. The first is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. For it has been stated (81, 2), that the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> was transmitted to his posterity. Wherefore in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is one in number; and in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, it is one in proportion, i.e. in relation to its first principle. The second reason may be taken from the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Because in every inordinate disposition, unity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, while the unity of number is derived from the subject. For example, take bodily sickness: various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sickness proceed from different <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, e.g. from excessive heat or cold, or from a lesion in the lung or liver; while one specific sickness in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will be one in number. Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this corrupt disposition that is called <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, is one only, viz. the privation of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, removing the subjection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is specifically one, and, in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, can be only one in number; while, in different men, it is one in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and in proportion, but is numerically many.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The employment of the plural--"in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>"--may be explained by the custom of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> in the frequent use of the plural for the singular, e.g. "They are dead that sought the life of the child"; or by the fact that all actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> virtually pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as in a principle so that it is virtually many; or by the fact of there being many deformities in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, disobedience, <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, and so forth; or by several parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being infected by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Of itself and directly, i.e. by its own form, one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> cannot incline its subject to contraries. But there is no reason why it should not do so, indirectly and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, i.e. by the removal of an obstacle: thus, when the harmony of a mixed body is destroyed, the elements have contrary local tendencies. In like manner, when the harmony of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is destroyed, the various powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> have various opposite tendencies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> infects the different parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in so far as they are the parts of one whole; even as original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> held all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> parts together in one. Consequently there is but one <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>: just as there is but one fever in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, although the various parts of the body are affected.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether original sin is concupiscence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 4,30). But <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is in accordance with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since it is the proper act of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty which is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, through <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> "the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" are in us, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse5">Romans 7:5</a>). Now there are several other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> besides <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, as stated above (Question 23, Article 4). Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> any more than another passion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, all the parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are disordered, as stated above (2, Objection 3). But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the highest of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> parts, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. x, 7). Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 15): "Concupiscence is the guilt of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Everything takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>: and it has been stated (2) that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is taken from its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Consequently the formal element of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> must be considered in respect of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. But contraries have contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> must be considered with respect to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is opposed to it. Now the whole order of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will being subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: which subjection, first and chiefly, was in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whose function it is to move all the other parts to the end, as stated above (Question 9, Article 1), so that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> being turned away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> become inordinate. Accordingly the privation of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> was made subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the formal element in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; while every other disorder of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers, is a kind of material element in respect of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Now the inordinateness of the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> consists chiefly in their turning inordinately to mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; which inordinateness may be called by the general name of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, materially, but privation of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, formally.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> governed by reason, the act of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is so far <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as it is in accord with the order of reason; while, in so far as it trespasses beyond the bounds of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it is, for a man, contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Such is the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (Question 25, Article 1), all the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are reducible to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as holding the principle place: and of these, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is the most impetuous in moving, and is felt most, as stated above (25, 2, ad 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, as being the chief passion, and as including all the others, in a fashion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As, in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and reason stand first, so conversely in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, the lower part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is found to take precedence, for it clouds and draws the reason, as stated above (77, A1,2; 80, 2). Hence <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is called <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, although <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is comprised among the material defects of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether original sin is equally in all?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not equally in all. Because <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is inordinate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Now all are not equally prone to acts of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not equally in all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is an inordinate disposition of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, just as sickness is an inordinate disposition of the body. But sickness is subject to degrees. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is subject to degrees.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nup. et Concep. i, 23) that "<a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> transmits <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> to the child." But the act of generation may be more <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> in one than in another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> may be greater in one than in another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (Question 81, Article 1). But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is equally in all. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is too.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two things in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>: one is the privation of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; the other is the relation of this privation to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, from whom it is transmitted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through his corrupt origin. As to the first, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> has no degrees, since the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is taken away entirely; and privations that remove something entirely, such as death and darkness, cannot be more or less, as stated above (Question 73, Article 2). In like manner, neither is this possible, as to the second: since all are related equally to the first principle of our corrupt origin, from which principle <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> takes the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of guilt; for relations cannot be more or less. Consequently it is evident that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> cannot be more in one than in another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Through the bond of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> being broken, which held together all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in a certain order, each power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> tends to its own proper movement, and the more impetuously, as it is stronger. Now it happens that some of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers are stronger in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than in another, on account of the different bodily temperaments. Consequently if one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more prone than another to acts of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, this is not due to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, because the bond of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is equally broken in all, and the lower parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are, in all, left to themselves equally; but it is due to the various dispositions of the powers, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sickness of the body, even sickness of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, has not an equal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in all; for instance if a fever be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by corruption of the bile, the corruption may be greater or less, and nearer to, or further from a vital principle. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is equal to all, so that there is not comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is not the actual <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> that transmits <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>: for, supposing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were to grant to a man to feel no inordinate <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> in the act of generation, he would still transmit <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; we must understand this to be <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, whereby the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not kept subject to reason by the bonds of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. This <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is equally in all.
