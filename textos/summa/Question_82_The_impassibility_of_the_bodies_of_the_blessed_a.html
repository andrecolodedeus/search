<h1>Question 82. The impassibility of the bodies of the blessed after their resurrection</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5082.htm#article1"> Will the bodies of the saints be impassible after the resurrection?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5082.htm#article2"> Will all be equally impassible?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5082.htm#article3"> Does this impassibility render the glorious bodies?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5082.htm#article4"> In them, are all the senses act?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the bodies of the saints will be impassible after the resurrection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will not be impassible after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. For everything mortal is passible. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, will be "a mortal rational animal," for such is the definition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which will never be dissociated from him. Therefore the body will be passible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to have the form of another thing is passible in relation to something else; for this is what is meant by being passive to another thing (De Gener. i). Now the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to the form of another thing after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>; since <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, according as it is under one form, does not lose its <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to another form. But the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will have <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in common with the elements, because they will be restored out of the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of which they are now composed. Therefore they will be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to another form, and thus will be passible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Gener. i), contraries have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to be active and passive towards one another. Now the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be composed of contraries after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, even as now. Therefore they will be passible.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body the blood and humors will rise again, as stated above (80, 3,4). Now, sickness and such like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> arise in the body through the antipathy of the humors. Therefore the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be passible after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, actual defect is more inconsistent with perfection than <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> defect. But passibility denotes merely <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> defect. Since then there will be certain actual defects in the bodies of the blessed, such as the scars of the wounds in the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, even as they were in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it would seem that their perfections will not suffer, if we grant their bodies to be passible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Everything passible is corruptible, because "increase of passion results in loss of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>" [<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Topic. vi, 1. Now the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be incorruptible after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse42">1 Corinthians 15:42</a>, "It is sown in corruption, it shall rise in incorruption." Therefore they will be impassible.

<p>Further, the stronger is not passive to the weaker. But no body will be stronger than the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse43">1 Corinthians 15:43</a>): "It is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power." Therefore they will be impassible.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We speak of a thing being "passive" in two ways [Cf. I-II, 22, 1]. First in a broad sense, and thus every reception is called a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, whether the thing received be fitting to the receiver and perfect it, or contrary to it and corrupt it. The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> bodies are not said to be impassible by the removal of this kind of passion, since nothing pertaining to perfection is to be removed from them. In another way we use the word "passive" properly, and thus the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> defines passion (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) as being "a movement contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Hence an immoderate movement of the heart is called its passion, but a moderate movement is called its operation. The reason of this is that whatever is patient is drawn to the bounds of the agent, since the agent assimilates the patient to itself, so that, therefore, the patient as such is drawn beyond its own bounds within which it was confined. Accordingly taking passion in its proper sense there will be no <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to passion in the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> after <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>; wherefore they are said to be impassible.

<p>The reason however of this impassibility is assigned differently by different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Some ascribe it to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the elements, which will be different then from what it is now. For they say that the elements will remain, then, as to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, yet that they will be deprived of their active and passive <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>. But this does not seem to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: because the active and passive <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> belong to the perfection of the elements, so that if the elements were restored without them in the body of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that rises again, they would be less perfect than now. Moreover since these <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> are the proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of the elements, being <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by their form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it would seem most absurd for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to remain and the effect to be removed. Wherefore others say that the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> will remain, but deprived of their proper activities, the Divine power so doing for the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. This however would seem to be untenable, since the action and passion of the active and passive <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the mixture (of the elements), and according as one or the other preponderates the mixed (bodies) differ in their respective complexions, and this must apply to the bodies of those who rise again, for they will contain flesh and bones and like parts, all of which demand different complexions. Moreover, according to this, impassibility could not be one of their <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, because it would not imply a disposition in the impassible <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but merely an external preventive to passion, namely the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which might produce the same effect in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body even in this state of life. Consequently others say that in the body itself there will be something preventing the passion of a glorified body, namely the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a fifth [The other four being the elements; this fifth element was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the peripatetic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> as the quintessence, of which they held heavenly bodies to be formed]: or heavenly body, which they maintain enters into the composition of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, to the effect of blending the elements together in harmony so as to be fitting <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but that in this state of life, on account of the preponderance of the elemental <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is passible like other elements, whereas in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the fifth body will predominate, so that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body will be made impassible in likeness to the heavenly body. But this cannot stand, because the fifth body does not enter materially into the composition of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (Sent. ii, D, 12, Q. 1, 1). Moreover it is absurd to say that a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, such as the power of a heavenly body, should endow the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body with a property of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, such as the impassibility of a glorified body, since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> ascribes to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power the transformation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, because "such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly" (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse48">1 Corinthians 15:48</a>), and "He will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, according to the operation whereby also He is able to subdue all things unto Himself" (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a>). And again, a heavenly <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot exercise such power over the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body as to take from it its elemental <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which is passible by reason of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> constituents. Consequently we must say otherwise that all passion results from the agent overcoming the patient, else it would not draw it to its own bounds. Now it is impossible for agent to overcome patient except through the weakening of the hold which the form of the patient has over its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, if we speak of the passion which is against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for it is of passion in this sense that we are speaking now: for <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not subject to one of two contraries, except through the cessation or at least the diminution of the hold which the other contrary has on it. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body and all that it contains will be perfectly subject to the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be perfectly subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore it will be impossible for the glorified body to be subject to any change contrary to the disposition whereby it is perfected by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and consequently those bodies will be impassible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> (Cur Deus Homo ii, 11), "mortal is included in the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers'</a> definition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could be ever <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, for they had no experience of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> otherwise than in this state of mortality." Or we may say that since, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. vi, 12), <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> differences are unknown to us, we sometimes employ <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> differences in order to signify <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> differences from which the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> differences result. Hence "mortal" is put in the definition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not as though mortality were <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but because that which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> passibility and mortality in the present state of life, namely composition of contraries, is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but it will not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it then, on account of the triumph of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> over the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">Potentiality</a> is twofold, tied and free: and this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> not only of active but also of passive <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. For the form ties the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, by determining it to one thing, and it is thus that it overcomes it. And since in corruptible things form does not perfectly overcome <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it cannot tie it completely so as to prevent it from sometimes receiving a disposition contrary to the form through some passion. But in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will have complete dominion over the body, and it will be altogether impossible for it to lose this dominion, because it will be immutably subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which was not the case in the state of innocence. Consequently those bodies will retain substantially the same <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> as they have now to another form; yet that <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> will remain tied by the triumph of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> over the body, so that it will never be realized by actual passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The elemental <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> are the instruments of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated in De Anima ii, text. 38, seqq., for the heat of fire in an animal's body is directed in the act of nutrition by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> power. When, however, the principal agent is perfect, and there is no defect in the instrument, no action proceeds from the instrument, except in accordance with the disposition of the principal agent. Consequently in the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, no action or passion will result from the elemental <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> that is contrary to the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which has the preservation of the body in view.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Ep. ad Consent. cxlvi) "the Divine power is able to remove" whatever <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> He will "from this visible and tangible body, other <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> remaining." Hence even as in a certain respect "He deprived the flames of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Chaldees'</a> furnace of the power to burn, since the bodies of the children were preserved without hurt, while in another respect that power remained, since those flames consumed the wood, so will He remove passibility from the humors while leaving their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> unchanged." It has been explained in the Article how this is brought about.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The scars of wounds will not be in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, nor were they in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in so far as they imply a defect, but as signs of the most steadfast <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> suffered for the sake of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: so that this will increase their own and others' <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> (Cf. III, 54, 4, ad 3). Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxii, 19): "We feel an undescribable love for the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> so as to desire to see in that kingdom the scars of the wounds in their bodies, which they bore for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name. Perchance indeed we shall see them for this will not make them less comely but more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>. A certain beauty will shine in them, a beauty though in the body, yet not of the body but of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Nevertheless those <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who have been maimed and deprived of their limbs will not be without those limbs in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>, for to them it is said (<a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse18">Luke 21:18</a>): "A hair of your head shall not perish."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether all will be equally impassible?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all will be equally impassible. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse42">1 Corinthians 15:42</a>, "It is sown in corruption," says that "all have equal immunity from suffering." Now the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of impassibility consists in immunity from suffering. Therefore all will be equally impassible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, negations are not subject to be more or less. Now impassibility is a negation or privation of passibility. Therefore it cannot be greater in one subject than in another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a thing is more white if it have less admixture of black. But there will be no admixture of passibility in any of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> bodies. Therefore they will all be equally impassible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Reward should be proportionate to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Now some of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were greater in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> than others. Therefore, since impassibility is a reward, it would seem to be greater in some than in others.

<p>Further, impassibility is condivided with the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of clarity. Now the latter will not be equal in all, according to <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse41">1 Corinthians 15:41</a>. Therefore neither will impassibility be equal in all.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Impassibility may be considered in two ways, either in itself, or in respect of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. If it be considered in itself, since it denotes a mere negation or privation, it is not subject to be more or less, but will be equal in all the blessed. on the other hand, if we consider it in relation to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, thus it will be greater in one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> than in another. Now its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the dominion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> over the body, and this dominion is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> unchangeable enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently in one who enjoys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more perfectly, there is a greater <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of impassibility.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> is speaking of impassibility in itself and not in relation to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although negations and privations considered in themselves are not increased nor diminished, yet they are subject to increase and diminution in relation to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Thus a place is said to be more darksome from having more and greater obstacles to light.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some things increase not only by receding from their contrary, but also by approach to a term: thus light increases. Consequently impassibility also is greater in one subject than in another, although there is no passibility remaining in any one.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether impassibility excludes actual sensation from glorified bodies?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that impassibility excludes actual sensation from glorified bodies. For according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, 11), "sensation is a kind of passion." But the glorified bodies will be impassible. Therefore they will not have actual sensation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> alteration precedes <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>* alteration, just as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being precedes intentional being. Now glorified bodies, by reason of their impassibility, will not be subject to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> alteration. ["Animalem," as though it were derived from "animus"--the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Cf. I-II, 50, 1,3m; I-II, 52, 1,3m.] Therefore they will not be subject to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> alteration which is requisite for sensation.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whenever actual sensation is due to a new perception, there is a new judgment. But in that state there will be no new judgment, because "our thoughts will not then be unchangeable," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 16). Therefore there will be no actual sensation.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, when the act of one of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers is intense, the acts of the other powers are remiss. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be supremely intent on the act of the contemplative power in contemplating <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will have no actual sensation whatever.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse7">Apocalypse 1:7</a>): "Every eye shall see Him." Therefore there will be actual sensation.

<p>Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima i, 2) "the animate is distinct from the inanimate by sensation and movement." Now there will be actual movement since they "shall run to and fro like sparks among the reeds" (<a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse7">Wisdom 3:7</a>). Therefore there will also be actual sensation.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All are agreed that there is some sensation in the bodies of the blessed: else the bodily life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> would be likened to sleep rather than to vigilance. Now this is not befitting that perfection, because in sleep a sensible body is not in the ultimate act of life, for which reason sleep is described as half-life. [This is what <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says: "The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the bad are in sleep least distinguishable: hence men say that for half their lives there is no difference between the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and the unhappy" (Ethic. i, 13)] But there is a difference of opinion as to the mode of sensation.

<p>For some say that the glorified bodies will be impassible, and consequently "not susceptible to impressions from without" [Cf. 74, 4, On the contrary] and much less so than the heavenly bodies, because they will have actual sensations, not by receiving <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from sensibles, but by emission of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But this is impossible, since in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> will remain the same in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and in all his parts. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of sense is to be a passive power as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (De Anima ii, text. 51,54). Wherefore if the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, were to have sensations by emitting and not by receiving <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, sense in them would be not a passive but an active power, and thus it would not be the same specifically with sense as it is now, but would be some other power bestowed on them; for just as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> never becomes form, so a passive power never becomes active. Consequently others say that the senses will be actualized by receiving <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, not indeed from external sensibles, but by an outflow from the higher powers, so that as now the higher powers receive from the lower, so on the contrary the lower powers will then receive from the higher. But this mode of reception does not result in real sensation, because every passive power, according to its specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is determined to some special active principle, since a power as such bears relation to that with respect to which it is said to be the power. Wherefore since the proper active principle in external sensation is a thing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and not an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> thereof <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> or reason, if the organ of sense be not moved by external things, but by the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> or other higher powers, there will be no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sensation. Hence we do not say that <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a> or other witless <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (in whom there is this kind of outflow of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> towards the organs of sense, on account of the powerful influence of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>) have real sensations, but that it seems to them that they have sensations. Consequently we must say with others that sensation in glorified bodies will result from the reception of things outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. It must, however, be observed that the organs of sense are transmuted by things outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in two ways. First by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> transmutation, when namely the organ is disposed by the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> as the thing outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which acts on that organ: for instance, when the hand is heated by touching a hot object, or becomes fragrant through contact with a fragrant object. Secondly, by a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> transmutation, as when a sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is received in an instrument, according to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> mode of being, when, namely, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, and not the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> itself is received: thus the pupil receives the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of whiteness and yet does not itself become white. Accordingly the first reception does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sensation, properly speaking, because the senses are receptive of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> but without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. that is to say without the material "being" which the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> had outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (De Anima ii, text. 121). This reception transmutes the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the recipient, because in this way the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is received according to its material "being." Consequently this kind of reception will not be in the glorified bodies, but the second, which of itself <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> actual sensation, without changing the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the recipient.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As already explained, by this passion that takes place in actual sensation and is no other than the aforesaid reception of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, the body is not drawn away from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, but is perfected by a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> change. Wherefore the impassibility of glorified bodies does not exclude this kind of passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Every subject of passion receives the action of the agent according to its mode. Accordingly if there be a thing that is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> adapted to be altered by an active principle, with a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> alteration, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> alteration precedes the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> alteration, just as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> precedes intentional being. If however a thing be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> adapted to be altered only with a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> alteration it does not follow that it is altered <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. For instance the air is not receptive of color, according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being, but only according to its <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> being, wherefore in this way alone is it altered: whereas, on the contrary, inanimate bodies are altered by sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> only <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> and not spiritually. But in the glorified bodies there cannot be any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> alteration, and consequently there will be only <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> alteration.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as there will be new reception of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the organs of sensation, so there will be new judgment in the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a>: but there will be no new judgment on the point in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; such is the case with one who sees what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> before. The saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, that "there our thoughts will not be changeable," refers to the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part: therefore it is not to the point.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> When one of two things is the type of the other, the attention of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the one does not hinder or lessen its attention to the other: thus a physician while considering urine is not less but more able to bear in mind the rules of his art concerning the colors of urine. And since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is apprehended by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as the type of all things that will be done or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by them, their attention to perceiving sensibles, or to contemplating or doing anything else will nowise hinder their <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor conversely. Or we may say that the reason why one power is hindered in its act when another power is intensely engaged is because one power does not alone suffice for such an intense operation, unless it be assisted by receiving from the principle of life the inflow that the other powers or members should receive. And since in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> all the powers will be most perfect, one will be able to operate intensely without thereby hindering the operation of another power even as it was with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether in the blessed, after the resurrection, all the senses will be in act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all the senses are not in act there. For touch is the first of all the senses (De Anima ii, 2). But the glorified body will lack the actual sense of touch, since the sense of touch becomes actual by the alteration of an animal body by some external body preponderating in some one of the active or passive <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> which touch is capable of discerning: and such an alteration will then be impossible. Therefore all the senses will not be in act there.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the sense of taste assists the action of the nutritive power. Now after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> there will be no such action, as stated above (Question 81, Article 4). Therefore taste would be useless there.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing will be corrupted after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> because the whole creature will be invested with a certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of incorruption. Now the sense of smell cannot have its act without some corruption having taken place, because smell is not perceived without a volatile evaporation consisting in a certain dissolution. Therefore the sense of smell is not there in its act.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, "Hearing assists teaching" (De Sensu et Sensato i). But the blessed, after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, will require no teaching by means of sensible objects, since they will be filled with Divine wisdom by the very <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>. Therefore hearing will not be there.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further. seeing results from the pupil receiving the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the thing seen. But after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> this will be impossible in the blessed. Therefore there will be no actual seeing there, and yet this is the most noble of the senses. The minor is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> thus: That which is actually lightsome is not receptive of a visible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and consequently a mirror placed under the sun's rays does not reflect the image of a body opposite to it. Now the pupil like the whole body will be endowed with clarity. Therefore it will not receive the image of a colored body.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, according to the science of perspective, whatever is seen is seen at an angle. But this does not apply to the glorified bodies. Therefore they will not have actual sense of sight. The minor is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> thus. Whenever a thing is seen at an angle, the angle must be proportionate to the distance of the object seen: because what is seen from a greater distance is less seen and at a lesser angle, so that the angle may be so small that nothing is seen of the object. Therefore if the glorified eye sees at an angle, it follows that it sees things within a certain distance, and that consequently it does not see a thing from a greater distance than we see now: and this would seem very absurd. And thus it would seem that the sense of sight will not be actual in glorified bodies.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A power conjoined to its act is more perfect than one not so conjoined. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the blessed will be in its greatest perfection. Therefore all the senses will be actual there.

<p>Further, the sensitive powers are nearer to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than the body is. But the body will be rewarded or punished on account of the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or demerits of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore all the senses in the blessed will also be rewarded and in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will be punished, with regard to pleasure and pain or sorrow which consist in the operation of the senses.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two opinions on this question. For some say that in the glorified bodies there will be all the sensitive powers, but that only two senses will be in act, namely touch and sight; nor will this be owing to defective senses, but from lack of medium and object; and that the senses will not be useless, because they will conduce to the integrity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and will show forth the wisdom of their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>. But this is seemingly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, because the medium in these senses is the same as in the others. For in the sight the medium is the air, and this is also the medium in hearing and smelling (De Anima ii, 7). Again, the taste, like the touch, has the medium in contact, since taste is a kind of touch (De Anima ii, 9). Smell also which is the object of the sense of smell will be there, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> sings that the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be a most sweet smell. There will also be vocal praise in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/psa149.htm#verse6">Psalm 149:6</a>, "The high praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall be in their mouth" that "hearts and tongues shall not cease to praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." The same is had on the authority of a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/neh012.htm#verse27">Nehemiah 12:27</a>, "With singing and with cymbals." Wherefore, according to others we may say that smelling and hearing will be in act there, but taste will not be in act, in the sense of being affected by the taking of food or drink, as appears from what we have said (81, 4): unless perchance we say that there will be taste in act through the tongue being affected by some neighboring humor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> perceived by the touch are those which constitute the animal body. Wherefore the body of an animal has, through its tangible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> according to the present state of life, a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to be affected with a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> alteration by the object of touch. For this reason the touch is said to be the most material of the senses, since it has a greater measure of material alteration connected with it. Yet material alteration is only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> related to the act of sensation which is effected by a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> alteration. Consequently the glorified bodies, which by reason of their impassibility are immune from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> alteration, will be subject only to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> alteration by tangible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>. Thus it was with the body of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, which could neither be burned by fire, nor pierced by sword, although he had the sense of such things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Taste, in so far as it is the perception of food, will not be in act; but perhaps it will be possible in so far as it is cognizant of flavors in the way mentioned above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some have considered smell to be merely a volatile evaporation. But this opinion cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; which is evident from the fact that vultures hasten to a corpse on perceiving the odor from a very great distance, whereas it would be impossible for an evaporation to travel from the corpse to a place so remote, even though the whole corpse were to be dissolved into vapor. This is confirmed by the fact that sensible objects at an equal distance exercise their influence in all directions: so that smell affects the medium sometimes, and the instrument of sensation with a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> alteration, without any evaporation reaching the organ. That some evaporation should be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> is due to the fact that smell in bodies is mixed with humidity; wherefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for dissolution to take place in order for the smell to be perceived. But in the glorified bodies odor will be in its ultimate perfection, being nowise hampered by humidity: wherefore it will affect the organ with a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> alteration, like the odor of a volatile evaporation. Such will be the sense of smell in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, because it will not be hindered by any humidity: and it will take cognizance not only of the excellences of odors, as happens with us now on account of the very great humidity of the brain, but also of the minutest differences of odors.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> there will be vocal praise (though indeed some think otherwise), and in the blessed it will affect the organ of hearing by a merely <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> alteration. Nor will it be for the sake of learning whereby they may acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but for the sake of the perfection of the sense and for the sake pleasure. How it is possible for the voice to give sound there, we have already stated (Sent. ii, D, 2; 2, 2, ad 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The intensity of light does not hinder the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> reception of the image of color, so long as the pupil retains its diaphanous <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thus it is evident that however much the air be filled with light, it can be the medium of sight, and the more it is illumined, the more clearly are objects seen through it, unless there be a fault through defective sight. The fact that the image of an object placed in opposition to a mirror directly opposite the sun's rays does not appear therein, is not due to the reception being hindered, but to the hindering of reflection: because for an image to appear in a mirror it must needs be thrown back by an opaque body, for which reason lead is affixed to the glass in a mirror. The sun's ray dispels this opacity so that no image can appear in the mirror. But the clarity of a glorified body does not destroy the diaphanous <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the pupil, since <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> does not destroy <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and consequently the greatness of clarity in the pupil renders the sight keen rather than defective.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The more perfect the sense the less does it require to be altered in order to perceive its object. Now the smaller the angle at which the sight is affected by the visible object, the less is the organ altered. Hence it is that a stronger sight can see from a distance more than a weaker sight; because the greater the distance the smaller the angle at which a thing is seen. And since the sight of a glorified body will be most perfect it will be able to see by the very least alteration (of the organ); and consequently at a very much smaller angle than now, and therefore from a much greater distance.
