<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the consecration of this sacrament belongs to a priest alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not belong exclusively to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Because it was said above (Question 78, Article 4) that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in virtue of the words, which are the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But those words are not changed, whether spoken by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or by anyone else. Therefore, it seems that not only a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but anyone else, can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> this sacrament.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> performs this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But a devout <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> is united with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore, it seems that even a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> can perform this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Opus imperfectum in Matth., Hom. xliii) says that "every <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is ordained for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, so also is this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as is clear from what was said above (74, 1; 79, 2). But a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> can also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, as was stated above (67, 3). Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not proper to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is completed in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of other matters such as the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil, and blessed oil, belongs exclusively to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; yet their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> does not equal the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, in which the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is contained. Therefore it belongs, not to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but only to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to perform this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says in an Epistle to Ludifred (<a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, dist. 25): "It belongs to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> this sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord's</a> body and blood upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> altar."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (78, 1,4), such is the dignity of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that it is performed only as in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now whoever performs any act in another's stead, must do so by the power bestowed by such a one. But as the power of receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is conceded by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so likewise the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> this sacrament on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> behalf is bestowed upon the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at his ordination: for thereby he is put upon a level with them to whom the Lord said (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse19">Luke 22:19</a>): "Do this for a commemoration of Me." Therefore, it must be said that it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to accomplish this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sacramental power is in several things, and not merely in one: thus the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> lies both in the words and in the water. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> power is not merely in the words, but likewise in the power delivered to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> and ordination, when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> says to him: "Receive the power of offering up the Sacrifice in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for the living as well as for the dead." For instrumental power lies in several instruments through which the chief agent acts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A devout <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> is united with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> union through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but not by sacramental power: consequently he has a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> for offering <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, of which it is said (<a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse19">Psalm 1:19</a>): "A sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an afflicted spirit"; and (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans 12:1</a>): "Present your bodies a living sacrifice." Hence, too, it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse5">1 Peter 2:5</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, to offer up <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The receiving of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not of such <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> as the receiving of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as is evident from what was said above (65, 3,4; 80, 11, ad 2). And therefore, although a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, he cannot perform this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> receives power to act on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> behalf upon His <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a>, that is, upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> receives no such power in his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, although he may have it by commission from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Consequently all such things as do not belong to the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a> are not reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to deliver, not only to the people, but likewise to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, such things as serve them in the fulfillment of their respective duties. And because the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil, and of the oil of the sick, and other <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> things, such as altars, churches, <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>, and sacred vessels, makes such things fit for use in performing the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which belong to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, therefore such consecrations are reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as the head of the whole ecclesiastical order.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether several priests can consecrate one and the same host?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> one and the same host. For it was said above (Question 67, Article 6), that several cannot at the same time <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. But the power of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> is not less than that of a man <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>. Therefore, several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> one host at the same time.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what can be done by one, is superfluously done by several. But there ought to be nothing superfluous in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Since, then, one is sufficient for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a>, it seems that several cannot <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> one host.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.), this is "the sacrament of unity." But multitude seems to be opposed to unity. Therefore it seems inconsistent with the sacrament for several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the same host.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is the custom of some Churches for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> newly ordained to co-celebrate with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ordaining them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), when a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is ordained he is placed on a level with those who received <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> power from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> at the Supper. And therefore, according to the custom of some Churches, as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> supped when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> supped, so the newly ordained co-celebrate with the ordaining <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Nor is the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, on that account, repeated over the same host, because as <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> says (De Sacr. Alt. Myst. iv), the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of all should be directed to the same instant of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We do not read of Christ <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> when He committed to them the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>; consequently there is no parallel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> were acting in his own power, then other celebrants would be superfluous, since one would be sufficient. But whereas the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> except as in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> stead; and since many are "one in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse28">Galatians 3:28</a>); consequently it does not <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> whether this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by one or by many, except that the rite of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be observed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">ecclesiastical unity</a>, which is brought about by many being "one in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether dispensing of this sacrament belongs to a priest alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the dispensing of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not belong to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood belongs to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> no less than His body. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood is dispensed by <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>: hence the blessed Lawrence said to the blessed Sixtus (Office of St. Lawrence, Resp. at Matins): "Try whether you have chosen a fit minister, to whom you have entrusted the dispensing of the Lord's blood." Therefore, with equal reason the dispensing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body does not belong to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> only.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are the appointed ministers of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is completed in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and not in the use, to which the dispensing belongs. Therefore it seems that it does not belong to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to dispense the Lord's body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii, iv) that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, like <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, has the power of perfecting. But it belongs, not to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to sign with the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>. Therefore likewise, to dispense this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and not to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (De Consecr., dist. 12): "It has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> deliver the Lord's body to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> or to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to carry it to the sick: The synod therefore forbids such presumption to continue; and let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> himself communicate the sick."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The dispensing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for three reasons. First, because, as was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), he consecrates as in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But as Christ <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> His body at the supper, so also He gave it to others to be partaken of by them. Accordingly, as the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, so likewise does the dispensing belong to him. Secondly, because the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is the appointed intermediary between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the people; hence as it belongs to him to offer the people's <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so it belongs to him to deliver <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> to the people. Thirdly, because out of reverence towards this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, nothing touches it, but what is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>; hence the corporal and the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and likewise the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> hands, for touching this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Hence it is not lawful for anyone else to touch it except from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, for instance, if it were to fall upon the ground, or else in some other case of urgency.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, as being nigh to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order, has a certain share in the latter's duties, so that he may dispense the blood; but not the body, except in case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, at the bidding of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. First of all, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood is contained in a vessel, hence there is no need for it to be touched by the dispenser, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is touched. Secondly, because the blood denotes the redemption derived by the people from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; hence it is that water is mixed with the blood, which water denotes the people. And because <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> are between <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and people, the dispensing of the blood is in the competency of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, rather than the dispensing of the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> For the reason given above, it belongs to the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to dispense and to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> this sacrament.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, in a measure, shares in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> "power of enlightening" (Eccl. Hier. v), inasmuch as he dispenses the blood. so the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shares in the "perfective dispensing" (Eccl. Hier. v) of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, inasmuch as he dispenses this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected in himself by union with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But other perfections whereby a man is perfected in relation to others, are reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the priest who consecrates is bound to receive this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who consecrates is not bound to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Because, in the other consecrations, he who consecrates the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not use it, just as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the chrism is not anointed therewith. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> performing this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> need not use the same, but may lawfully refrain from receiving it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> the minister does not give the sacrament to himself: for no one can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> himself, as stated above (66, 5, ad 4). But as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is dispensed in due order, so also is this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who consecrates this sacrament ought not to receive it at his own hands.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it sometimes happens that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body appears upon the altar under the guise of flesh, and the blood under the guise of blood; which are unsuited for food and drink: hence, as was said above (Question 75, Article 5), it is on that account that they are given under another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, lest they beget revulsion in the communicants. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who consecrates is not always bound to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We read in the acts of the (Twelfth) Council of Toledo (Can. v), and again (De Consecr., dist. 2): "It must be strictly observed that as often as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> upon the altar, he must himself be a partaker of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and blood."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (79, 5,7), the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is not only a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but also a sacrifice. Now whoever offers sacrifice must be a sharer in the sacrifice, because the outward sacrifice he offers is a sign of the inner sacrifice whereby he offers himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x). Hence by partaking of the sacrifice he shows that the inner one is likewise his. In the same way also, by dispensing the sacrifice to the people he shows that he is the dispenser of Divine <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, of which he ought himself to be the first to partake, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii). Consequently, he ought to receive before dispensing it to the people. Accordingly we read in the chapter mentioned above (Twelfth Council of Toledo, Can. v): "What kind of sacrifice is that wherein not even the sacrificer is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have a share?" But it is by partaking of the sacrifice that he has a share in it, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse18">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>): "Are not they that eat of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, partakers of the altar?" Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as often as he consecrates, to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in its integrity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of chrism or of anything else is not a sacrifice, as the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is: consequently there is no parallel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is accomplished in the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and consequently no one can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> himself, because the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot be active and passive in a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Hence neither in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> himself, but he consecrates the bread and wine, in which <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the sacrament is completed. But the use thereof follows the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and therefore there is no parallel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body appears <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> upon the altar under the guise of flesh, or the blood under the guise of blood, it is not to be received. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says upon Leviticus (cf. De Consecr., dist. 2): "It is lawful to eat of this sacrifice which is wonderfully performed in memory of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: but it is not lawful for anyone to eat of that one which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> offered on the altar of the cross." Nor does the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> transgress on that account, because <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> events are not subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> would be well advised to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> again and receive the Lord's body and blood.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a wicked priest can consecrate the Eucharist?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the Eucharist. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, commenting on <a href="../bible/zep003.htm#verse4">Zephaniah 3:4</a>, says: "The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who perform the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, and who distribute <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> blood to the people, act wickedly against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in deeming that the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> rather than by a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life; and that only the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is requisite, and not the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>: of whom it is said: 'Let not the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in whatever defilement he may be, approach to offer oblations to the Lord'" (<a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse21">Leviticus 21:21</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, being defiled, has neither the life nor the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> befitting this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv) that "the bread and wine are changed supernaturally into the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, by the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06406a.htm">Pope Gelasius I</a> says (Ep. ad Elphid., cf. Decret. i, q. 1): "How shall the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, when invoked, come for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the Divine Mystery, if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> invoking him be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> full of guilty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>?" Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>'s <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> is not efficacious for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> this sacrament, since it is written (<a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse2">Malachi 2:2</a>): "I will curse your blessings." Again, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says in his Epistle (viii) to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Demophilus: "He who is not enlightened has completely fallen away from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order; and I wonder that such a man dare to employ his hands in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> actions, and in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to utter, over the Divine symbols, his <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> infamies, for I will not call them <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Paschasius) says (De Corp. Dom. xii): "Within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church, in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Lord's body and blood, nothing greater is done by a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, nothing less by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, because it is not by the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of the consecrator that the sacrament is accomplished, but by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator's</a> word, and by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (1,3), the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> consecrates this sacrament not by his own power, but as the minister of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in Whose <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he consecrates this sacrament. But from the fact of being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> he does not cease to be Christ's minister; because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> has <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ministers or servants. Hence (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse45">Matthew 24:45</a>) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says: "Who, thinkest thou, is a faithful and wise servant?" and afterwards He adds: "But if that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> servant shall say in his heart," etc. And the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>) says: "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ"; and afterwards he adds: "I am not conscious to myself of anything; yet am I not hereby justified." He was therefore certain that he was Christ's minister; yet he was not certain that he was a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consequently, a man can be Christ's minister even though he be not one of the just. And this belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> excellence, Whom, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, things both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> serve, since they are ordained by His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> for His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, even though they be not godly, but sinners, can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In those words <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> is condemning the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> they could <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> worthily, from the mere fact of being <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, even though they were sinners; and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> condemns this from the fact that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> defiled are forbidden to approach the altar; but this does not prevent the sacrifice, which they offer, from being a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice, if they do approach.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Previous to the words quoted, <a href="../cathen/06406a.htm">Pope Gelasius</a> expresses himself as follows: "That most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> rite, which contains the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> discipline, claims for itself such reverence that no one may dare to approach it except with clean <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>." From this it is evident that his meaning is that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who is a sinner ought not to approach this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Hence when he resumes, "How shall the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> come when summoned," it must be understood that He comes, not through the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, but through the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Whose words the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> utters.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the same action can be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, inasmuch as it is done with a bad <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the servant; and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the master; so the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, inasmuch as he acts unworthily is deserving of a curse, and is reputed an infamy and a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and not a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; whereas, inasmuch as it is pronounced in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and efficacious. Hence it is said with significance: "I will curse your blessings."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the mass of a sinful priest is of less worth than the mass of a good priest?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the mass of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is not of less worth than that of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory</a> says in the Register: "Alas, into what a great snare they fall who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Divine and hidden mysteries can be sanctified more by some than by others; since it is the one and the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who hallows those mysteries in a hidden and invisible manner." But these hidden mysteries are celebrated in the mass. Therefore the mass of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is not of less value than the mass of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is conferred by a minister through the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who baptizes, so likewise this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is no better when conferred by a better <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as was said above (64, 1, ad 2). Therefore neither is a mass the better, which is celebrated by a better <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> differ in the point of being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and better, so they likewise differ in the point of being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad. Consequently, if the mass of a better <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> be itself better, it follows that the mass of a bad <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> must be bad. Now this is unreasonable, because the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the ministers cannot affect Christ's mysteries, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his work on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (Contra Donat. xii). Therefore neither is the mass of a better <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the better.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated in <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> i, q. 1: "The worthier the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the sooner is he heard in the needs for which he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two things to be considered in the mass. namely, the sacrament itself, which is the chief thing; and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which are offered up in the mass for the quick and the dead. So far as the mass itself is concerned, the mass of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is not of less value than that of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, because the same sacrifice is offered by both.

<p>Again, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> put up in the mass can be considered in two respects: first of all, in so far as it has its efficacy from the devotion of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">interceding</a>, and in this respect there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that the mass of the better <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is the more fruitful. In another respect, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is said by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the mass in the place of the entire Church, of which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is the minister; and this ministry remains even in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> men, as was said above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>) in regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> ministry. Hence, in this respect the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> even of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is fruitful, not only that which he utters in the mass, but likewise all those he recites in the ecclesiastical offices, wherein he takes the place of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. on the other hand, his private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are not fruitful, according to <a href="../bible/pro028.htm#verse9">Proverbs 28:9</a>: "He that turneth away his ears from hearing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall be an abomination."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> is speaking there of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the Divine sacrament.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are not made for all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, as in the mass; therefore there is no parallel in this respect. There is, however, a resemblance as to the effect of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By reason of the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who communicates to each one the blessings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> members on account of their being united in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, the private <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> in the mass of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is fruitful to others. But the private <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot hurt another, except the latter, in some way, consent, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Parmen. ii).

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether heretics, schismatics, and excommunicated persons can consecrate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, schismatics, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not able to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the Eucharist. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Liber sentent. Prosperi xv) that "there is no such thing as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church": and Pope Leo I says (Ep. lxxx; cf. Decretal i, q. 1): Elsewhere "(i.e. than in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body) there is neither valid <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice." But <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, schismatics, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are severed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore they are unable to offer a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further (<a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a>, caus. i, q. 1), <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> is quoted as saying: "Because we receive the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and other pestilential <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, if they seem to repent, it does not follow that their clergy have the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> or of any other ministerial office, for we allow them to confer nothing save <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." But none can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, unless he have the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and the like cannot <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it does not seem feasible for one outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to act on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> consecrates the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, he does so in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the entire Church, as is evident from the fact of his putting up all <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore, it seems that those who are outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, such as those who are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, schismatics, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, are not able to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Parmen. ii): "Just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> remains in them," i.e. in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, schismatics, and those who are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, "so do their orders remain intact." Now, by the power of his ordination, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Therefore, it seems that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, schismatics, and those who are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, since their orders remain entire.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have contended that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, schismatics, and the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, who are outside the pale of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, cannot perform this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But herein they are deceived, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Parmen. ii), "it is one thing to lack something utterly, and another to have it improperly"; and in like fashion, "it is one thing not to bestow, and quite another to bestow, but not rightly." Accordingly, such as, being within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, received the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> through being ordained to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, have such power rightly indeed; but they use it improperly if afterwards they be separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, or <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. But such as are ordained while separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, have neither the power rightly, nor do they use it rightly. But that in both cases they have the power, is clear from what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Parmen. ii), that when they return to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they are not re-ordained, but are received in their orders. And since the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is an act which follows the power of order, such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as are separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, or <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, can indeed <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which on being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by them contains <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body and blood; but they act wrongly, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by doing so; and in consequence they do not receive the fruit of the sacrifice, which is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sacrifice.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Such and similar authorities are to be understood in this sense, that the sacrifice is offered wrongly outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there can be no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sacrifice that is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of its fruit, although it be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the sacrament; thus it was stated above (Question 80, Article 3), that the sinner receives <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body sacramentally, but not spiritually.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> alone is allowed to be conferred by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and schismatics, because they can lawfully <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; but in no case can they lawfully <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, or confer the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in reciting the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the mass, speaks instead of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in whose unity he remains; but in <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the sacrament he speaks as in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Whose place he holds by the power of his orders. Consequently, if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> severed from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrates mass, not having lost the power of order, he consecrates Christ's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body and blood; but because he is severed from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> have no efficacy.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether a degraded priest can consecrate this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a degraded <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> this sacrament. For no one can perform this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> except he have the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> "who has been degraded has no power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a>, although he has the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>" (App. Gratiani). Therefore it seems that a degraded <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he who gives can take away. But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in ordaining gives to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a>. Therefore he can take it away by degrading him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, by degradation, loses either the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a>, or the use of such power. But he does not lose merely the use, for thus the degraded one would lose no more than one <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, who also lacks the use. Therefore it seems that he loses the power to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>, and in consequence that he cannot perform this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Parmen. ii) proves that "apostates" from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> "are not deprived of their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>," from the fact that "it is not restored to them when they return repentant; and therefore it is deemed that it cannot be lost." But in like fashion, if the degraded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be restored, he has not to be ordained over again. Consequently, he has not lost the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a>, and so the degraded <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can perform this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> belongs to the character of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order. But every character is indelible, because it is given with a kind of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, as was said above (63, 5), just as the consecrations of all other things are perpetual, and cannot be lost or repeated. Hence it is clear that the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> is not lost by degradation. For, again, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Parmen. ii): "Both are <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>," namely <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and order, "and both are given to a man with a kind of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; the former, when he is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; the latter when he is ordained; and therefore it is not lawful for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to repeat either of them." And thus it is evident that the degraded <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can perform this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That Canon is speaking, not as by way of assertion, but by way of inquiry, as can be gleaned from the context.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power of order, not as though coming from himself, but instrumentally, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> minister, and its effect cannot be taken away by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse6">Matthew 19:6</a>: "What <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath joined together, let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> put asunder." And therefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot take this power away, just as neither can he who baptizes take away the baptismal character.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Excommunication is medicinal. And therefore the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power is not taken away from the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, as it were, perpetually, but only for a time, that they may mend; but the exercise is withdrawn from the degraded, as though condemned perpetually.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether it is permissible to receive communion from heretical, excommunicate, or sinful priests, and to hear mass said by them?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that one may lawfully receive Communion from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, or even <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and to hear mass said by them. Because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Petilian. iii), "we should not avoid <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, whether they be given by a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or by a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one." But <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, even if they be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, or <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, perform a valid sacrament. Therefore it seems that one ought not to refrain from receiving Communion at their hands, or from hearing their mass.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body is figurative of His <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a>, as was said above (Question 67, Article 2). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> mentioned above. Therefore it seems that whoever belongs to His <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a> can communicate in their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there are many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> graver than fornication. But it is not forbidden to hear the masses of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> otherwise. Therefore, it ought not to be forbidden to hear the masses of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> guilty of this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Canon says (Dist. 32): "Let no one hear the mass of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to have a <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a>." Moreover, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. ii.) that "the faithless father sent an Arian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to his son, for him to receive sacrilegiously the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Communion at his hands. But, when the Arian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> arrived, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> devoted servant rebuked him, as was right for him to do."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (5,7), <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, schismatical, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, or even <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, although they have the power to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, yet they do not make a proper use of it; on the contrary, they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by using it. But whoever communicates with another who is in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, becomes a sharer in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence we read in <a href="../bible/2jo001.htm#verse11">John's Second Canonical Epistle (11)</a> that "He that saith unto him, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speed you, communicateth with his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> works." Consequently, it is not lawful to receive Communion from them, or to assist at their mass.

<p>Still there is a difference among the above, because <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, schismatics, and excommunicates, have been forbidden, by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> sentence, to perform the Eucharistic rite. And therefore whoever hears their mass or receives the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> from them, commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But not all who are sinners are debarred by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> sentence from using this power: and so, although suspended by the Divine sentence, yet they are not suspended in regard to others by any ecclesiastical sentence: consequently, until the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> sentence is pronounced, it is lawful to receive Communion at their hands, and to hear their mass. Hence on <a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>, "with such a one not so much as to eat," <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> runs thus: "In saying this he was unwilling for a man to be judged by his fellow <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on arbitrary suspicion, or even by usurped extraordinary judgment, but rather by <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ordering, whether he confess of his own accord, or whether he be accused and convicted."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By refusing to hear the masses of such <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or to receive Communion from them, we are not shunning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; on the contrary, by so doing we are giving them <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> (hence a host <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by such <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> is to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>, and if it be reserved, it can be consumed by a lawful <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>): but what we shun is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the unworthy ministers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The unity of the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a> is the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body received. But those who receive or minister unworthily, are deprived of the fruit, as was said above (7; 80, 4). And therefore, those who belong to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> are not to receive the sacrament from their dispensing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although fornication is not graver than other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, yet men are more prone to it, owing to fleshly <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Consequently, this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is specially inhibited to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, lest anyone hear the mass of one living in <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>. However, this is to be understood of one who is <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a>, either from being convicted and sentenced, or from having acknowledged his guilt in legal form, or from it being impossible to conceal his guilt by any subterfuge.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether it is lawful for a priest to refrain entirely from consecrating the Eucharist?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems to be lawful for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to refrain entirely from <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the Eucharist. Because, as it is the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> office to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, so it is likewise to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and administer the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is not bound to act as a minister of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, unless he has undertaken the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Therefore, it seems that likewise he is not bound to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> except he be charged with the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one is bound to do what is unlawful for him to do; otherwise he would be in two minds. But it is not lawful for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who is in a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, as was said above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). Therefore it seems that such men are not bound to celebrate, and so neither are the others; otherwise they would be gainers by their fault.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity is not lost by subsequent weakness: because <a href="../cathen/06406a.htm">Pope Gelasius I</a> says (cf. <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a>, Dist. 55): "As the canonical precepts do not permit them who are feeble in body to approach the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, so if anyone be disabled when once in that state, he cannot lose that he received at the time he was well." But it sometimes happens that those who are already ordained as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> incur defects whereby they are hindered from celebrating, such as <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> or epilepsy, or the like. Consequently, it does not appear that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are bound to celebrate.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says in one of his Orations (xxxiii): "It is a grave <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> if we do not approach Thy altar with clean heart and pure hands; but it is graver still if while shunning <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> we also fail to offer our sacrifice."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have said that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may lawfully refrain altogether from <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a>, except he be bound to do so, and to give the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to the people, by reason of his being entrusted with the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>But this is said quite unreasonably, because everyone is bound to use the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> entrusted to him, when opportunity serves, according to <a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse1">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>: "We exhort you that you receive not the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in vain." But the opportunity of offering sacrifice is considered not merely in relation to the faithful of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to whom the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> must be administered, but chiefly with regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to Whom the sacrifice of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is offered by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a>. Hence, it is not lawful for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, even though he has not the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, to refrain altogether from celebrating; and he seems to be bound to celebrate at least on the chief festivals, and especially on those days on which the faithful usually communicate. And hence it is that (<a href="../bible/2ma004.htm#verse14">2 Maccabees 4:14</a>) it is said against some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that they "were not now occupied about the offices of the altar . . . despising the temple and neglecting the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are accomplished in being used by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and therefore he alone is bound to administer them who has undertaken the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is performed in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, whereby a sacrifice is offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is bound from the order he has received.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, if deprived by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> sentence from exercising his order, simply or for a time, is rendered incapable of offering sacrifice; consequently, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> lapses. But if not deprived of the power of celebrating, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is not removed; nor is he in two minds, because he can repent of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and then celebrate.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Weakness or sickness contracted by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> after his ordination does not deprive him of his orders; but hinders him from exercising them, as to the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>: sometimes by making it impossible to exercise them, as, for example, if he lose his sight, or his fingers, or the use of speech; and sometimes on account of danger, as in the case of one suffering from epilepsy, or indeed any disease of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; and sometimes, on account of loathsomeness, as is evident in the case of a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, who ought not to celebrate in public: he can, however, say mass privately, unless the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> has gone so far that it has rendered him incapable owing to the wasting away of his limbs.
