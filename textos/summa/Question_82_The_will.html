<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the will desires something of necessity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> desires nothing. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei v, 10) that if anything is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, it is not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. But whatever the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> desires is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Therefore nothing that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> desires is desired of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the rational powers, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. viii, 2), extend to opposite things. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a rational power, because, as he says (De Anima iii, 9), "the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in the reason." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> extends to opposite things, and therefore it is determined to nothing of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> we are masters of our own actions. But we are not masters of that which is of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Therefore the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be necessitated.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 4) that "all desire <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> with one will." Now if this were not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, but <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>, there would at least be a few exceptions. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> desires something of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>" is employed in many ways. For that which must be is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Now that a thing must be may belong to it by an intrinsic principle--either material, as when we say that everything composed of contraries is of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> corruptible--or formal, as when we say that it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the three angles of a triangle to be equal to two right angles. And this is "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>" and "absolute <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>." In another way, that a thing must be, belongs to it by reason of something extrinsic, which is either the end or the agent. On the part of the end, as when without it the end is not to be attained or so well attained: for instance, food is said to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for life, and a horse is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a journey. This is called "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of end," and sometimes also "utility." On the part of the agent, a thing must be, when someone is forced by some agent, so that he is not able to do the contrary. This is called "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of coercion."

<p>Now this <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of coercion is altogether repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For we call that <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> which is against the inclination of a thing. But the very movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is an inclination to something. Therefore, as a thing is called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> because it is according to the inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so a thing is called <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> because it is according to the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore, just as it is impossible for a thing to be at the same time <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, so it is impossible for a thing to be absolutely coerced or <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>.

<p>But <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of end is not repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, when the end cannot be attained except in one way: thus from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to cross the sea, arises in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to wish for a ship.

<p>In like manner neither is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Indeed, more than this, for as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> adheres to the first principles, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> adhere to the last end, which is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: since the end is in practical matters what the principle is in speculative matters. For what befits a thing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> and immovably must be the root and principle of all else appertaining thereto, since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing is the first in everything, and every movement arises from something immovable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> are to be understood of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of coercion. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> "does not take away the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>," as he says himself (De Civ. Dei v, 10).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The will, so far as it desires a thing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, corresponds rather to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as regards <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles than to the reason, which extends to opposite things. Wherefore in this respect it is rather an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> than a rational power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> We are masters of our own actions by reason of our being able to choose this or that. But choice regards not the end, but "the means to the end," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 9). Wherefore the desire of the ultimate end does not regard those actions of which we are masters.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the will desires of necessity, whatever it desires?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> desires all things of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, whatever it desires. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is outside the scope of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is proposed to it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is compared to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as the mover to the thing movable. But the movement of the movable <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follows the mover. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> object moves it of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the thing apprehended by sense is the object of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, so the thing apprehended by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But what is apprehended by the sense moves the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 14) that "animals are moved by things seen." Therefore it seems that whatever is apprehended by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 9) that "it is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> by which we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and live well," and so the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> extends to opposite things. Therefore it does not desire of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> all things whatsoever it desires.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The will does not desire of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> whatsoever it desires. In order to make this evident we must observe that as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> adheres to the first principles, so the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> adheres to the last end, as we have said already (1). Now there are some things intelligible which have not a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connection with the first principles; such as contingent propositions, the denial of which does not involve a denial of the first principles. And to such the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not assent of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. But there are some propositions which have a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connection with the first principles: such as demonstrable conclusions, a denial of which involves a denial of the first principles. And to these the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> assents of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, when once it is aware of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connection of these conclusions with the principles; but it does not assent of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> until through the demonstration it recognizes the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of such connection. It is the same with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For there are certain <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> goods which have not a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connection with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, because without them a man can be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>: and to such the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not adhere of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. But there are some things which have a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connection with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, by means of which things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> adheres to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Whom alone <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists. Nevertheless, until through the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of the Divine Vision the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of such connection be shown, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not adhere to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, nor to those things which are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> adheres to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just as now we desire of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. It is therefore clear that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not desire of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> whatever it desires.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The will can tend to nothing except under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is of many kinds, for this reason the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> determined to one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The mover, then, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> movement in the thing movable, when the power of the mover exceeds the thing movable, so that its entire capacity is subject to the mover. But as the capacity of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> regards the universal and perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, its capacity is not subjected to any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And therefore it is not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> moved by it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The sensitive power does not compare different things with each other, as reason does: but it simply apprehends some one thing. Therefore, according to that one thing, it moves the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in a determinate way. But the reason is a power that compares several things together: therefore from several things the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>--that is, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>--may be moved; but not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> from one thing.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the will is a higher power than the intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a higher power than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the end. But the end is the first and highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the first and highest power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things we observe a progress from imperfect things to perfect. And this also appears in the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for sense precedes the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is more noble. Now the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, follows the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a more noble and perfect power than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are proportioned to their powers, as perfections to what they make perfect. But the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which perfects the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>--namely, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>--is more noble than the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> which perfect the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>): "If I should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all mysteries, and if I should have all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, I am nothing." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a higher power than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> holds the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to be the higher power than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The superiority of one thing over another can be considered in two ways: "absolutely" and "relatively." Now a thing is considered to be such absolutely which is considered such in itself: but relatively as it is such with regard to something else. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will be considered with regard to themselves, then the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the higher power. And this is clear if we compare their respective objects to one another. For the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is more simple and more absolute than the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; since the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the very <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of appetible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and the appetible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of which is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now the more simple and the more abstract a thing is, the nobler and higher it is in itself; and therefore the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is higher than the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore, since the proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a power is in its order to its object, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in itself and absolutely is higher and nobler than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But relatively and by comparison with something else, we find that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is sometimes higher than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, from the fact that the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> occurs in something higher than that in which occurs the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Thus, for instance, I might say that hearing is relatively nobler than sight, inasmuch as something in which there is sound is nobler than something in which there is color, though color is nobler and simpler than sound. For as we have said above (<a href="../summa/1016.htm#article1">Question 16, Article 1</a>; <a href="../summa/1027.htm#article4">Question 27, Article 4</a>), the action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> consists in this--that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the thing understood is in the one who understands; while the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> consists in this--that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is inclined to the thing itself as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in itself. And therefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in Metaph. vi (Did. v, 2) that "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," which are objects of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, "are in things," but "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>," which are objects of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, "are in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>." When, therefore, the thing in which there is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is nobler than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, in which is the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> understood; by comparison with such a thing, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is higher than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But when the thing which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is less noble than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, then even in comparison with that thing the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is higher than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Wherefore the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is better than the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but, on the contrary, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of corporeal things is better than the love thereof. Absolutely, however, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is nobler than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The aspect of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> is perceived by comparing one thing to another, and in such a comparison the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is found to be nobler: but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> signifies something more absolute, and extends to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> itself: wherefore even <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is something <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But, again, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: forasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a thing, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> its end. And among other ends this is the most excellent: as also is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> among the other powers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> What precedes in order of generation and time is less perfect: for in one and in the same thing <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> precedes act, and imperfection precedes perfection. But what precedes absolutely and in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is more perfect: for thus act precedes <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. And in this way the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> precedes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as the motive power precedes the thing movable, and as the active precedes the passive; for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is understood moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This reason is verified of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as compared with what is above the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by which we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the will moves the intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not move the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For what moves excels and precedes what is moved, because what moves is an agent, and "the agent is nobler than the patient," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16), and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, 5). But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> excels and precedes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as we have said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not move the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what moves is not moved by what is moved, except perhaps <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apprehended by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> moves without being moved; whereas the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> moves and is moved. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we can will nothing but what we understand. If, therefore, in order to understand, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves by willing to understand, that act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> must be preceded by another act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and this act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by another act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and so on indefinitely, which is impossible. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not move the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 26): "It is in our power to learn an art or not, as we list." But a thing is in our power by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and we learn art by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to move in two ways:

<p>First, as an end; for instance, when we say that the end moves the agent. In this way the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> understood is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and moves it as an end.

<p>Secondly, a thing is said to move as an agent, as what alters moves what is altered, and what impels moves what is impelled. In this way the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (Eadmer, De Similitudinibus). The reason is, because wherever we have order among a number of active powers, that power which regards the universal end moves the powers which regard particular ends. And we may observe this both in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and in things politic. For the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, which aims at the universal preservation of things subject to generation and corruption, moves all inferior bodies, each of which aims at the preservation of its own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. The king also, who aims at the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole kingdom, by his rule moves all the governors of cities, each of whom rules over his own particular city. Now the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the end in general, and each power is directed to some suitable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> proper to it, as sight is directed to the perception of color, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as agent moves all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to their respective acts, except the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers of the vegetative part, which are not subject to our will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> may be considered in two ways: as apprehensive of universal being and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and as a thing and a particular power having a determinate act. In like manner also the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> may be considered in two ways: according to the common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its object--that is to say, as <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> of universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--and as a determinate power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> having a determinate act. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be compared with one another according to the universality of their respective objects, then, as we have said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is simply higher and nobler than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. If, however, we take the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as regards the common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its object and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as a determinate power, then again the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is higher and nobler than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, because under the notion of being and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is contained both the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> itself, and its act, and its object. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and its act, and its object, just as it understands other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things, as stone or wood, which are contained in the common notion of being and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But if we consider the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as regards the common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its object, which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as a thing and a special power; then the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself, and its act, and its object, which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, each of which is some <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, are contained under the common notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And in this way the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is higher than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and can move it. From this we can easily understand why these powers include one another in their acts, because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> wills, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> wills the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to understand. In the same way <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is contained in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, inasmuch as it is an understood <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, inasmuch as it is a desired <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in one sense, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in another, as we have said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is no need to go on indefinitely, but we must stop at the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as preceding all the rest. For every movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> must be preceded by apprehension, whereas every apprehension is not preceded by an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; but the principle of counselling and understanding is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle higher than our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> --namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--as also <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (Eth. Eudemic. vii, 14), and in this way he explains that there is no need to proceed indefinitely.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether we should distinguish irascible and concupiscible parts in the superior appetite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought to distinguish irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> parts in the superior <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power is so called from "concupiscere" [to desire], and the irascible part from "irasci" [to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>]. But there is a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> which cannot belong to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but only to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; as the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of wisdom, of which it is said (<a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse21">Wisdom 6:21</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of wisdom bringeth to the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal kingdom</a>." There is also a certain <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> which cannot belong to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but only to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>; as when our <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is directed against <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse33">Matthew 13:33</a> warns us "to have the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in the irascible part." Therefore we should distinguish irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> parts of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as well as in the sensitive.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as is commonly said, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, and hope in the irascible part. But they cannot be in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, because their objects are not sensible, but <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. Therefore we must assign an irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is said (De Spiritu et Anima) that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has these powers"--namely, the irascible, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, and rational--"before it is united to the body." But no power of the sensitive part belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, but to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body united, as we have said above (78, 5,8). Therefore the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers are in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> (Nemesius, De Nat. Hom.) says "that the irrational" part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is divided into the desiderative and irascible, and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says the same (De Fide Orth. ii, 12). And the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 9) "that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in reason, while in the irrational part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>," or "desire and animus."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> are not parts of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Because, as was said above (59, 4; 79, 7), a power which is directed to an object according to some common notion is not differentiated by special differences which are contained under that common notion. For instance, because sight regards the visible thing under the common notion of something colored, the visual power is not multiplied according to the different kinds of color: but if there were a power regarding white as white, and not as something colored, it would be distinct from a power regarding black as black.

<p>Now the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> does not consider the common notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because neither do the senses apprehend the universal. And therefore the parts of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> are differentiated by the different notions of particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> regards as proper to it the notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as something pleasant to the senses and suitable to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: whereas the irascible regards the notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as something that wards off and repels what is hurtful. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> according to the common notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and therefore in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, there is no differentiation of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers, so that there be in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> an irascible power distinct from a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power: just as neither on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are the apprehensive powers multiplied, although they are on the part of the senses.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Love, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, and the like can be understood in two ways. Sometimes they are taken as <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>--arising, that is, with a certain commotion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And thus they are commonly understood, and in this sense they are only in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. They may, however, be taken in another way, as far as they are simple affections without passion or commotion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and thus they are acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And in this sense, too, they are attributed to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if taken in this sense, they do not belong to different powers, but only to one power, which is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The will itself may be said to irascible, as far as it wills to repel <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not from any sudden movement of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, but from a judgment of the reason. And in the same way the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> may be said to be <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> on account of its desire for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And thus in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> are <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and hope--that is, in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as ordered to such acts. And in this way, too, we may understand the words quoted (De Spiritu et Anima); that the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> before it is united to the body (as long as we understand priority of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and not of time), although there is no need to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in what that book says. Whence the answer to the third objection is clear.
