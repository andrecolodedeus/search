<h1>Question 83. Free-will</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1083.htm#article1"> Does man have free-will?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1083.htm#article2"> What is free-will--a power, an act, or a habit?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1083.htm#article3"> If it is a power, is it appetitive or cognitive?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1083.htm#article4"> If it is appetitive, is it the same power as the will, or distinct?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether man has free-will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has not <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. For whoever has <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> does what he wills. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not what he wills; for it is written (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse19">Romans 7:19</a>): "For the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which I will I do not, but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which I will not, that I do." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has not <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever has <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> has in his power to will or not to will, to do or not to do. But this is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power: for it is written (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse16">Romans 9:16</a>): "It is not of him that willeth"--namely, to will--"nor of him that runneth"--namely, to run. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has not <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is "free is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of itself," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. i, 2). Therefore what is moved by another is not free. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse1">Proverbs 21:1</a>): "The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord; whithersoever He will He shall turn it" and (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse13">Philippians 2:13</a>): "It is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who worketh in you both to will and to accomplish." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has not <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whoever has <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is master of his own actions. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not master of his own actions: for it is written (<a href="../bible/jer010.htm#verse23">Jeremiah 10:23</a>): "The way of a man is not his: neither is it in a man to walk." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has not <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 5): "According as each one is, such does the end seem to him." But it is not in our power to be of one <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> or another; for this comes to us from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to us to follow some particular end, and therefore we are not free in so doing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse14">Sirach 15:14</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his own counsel"; and the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds: "That is of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Man has <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>: otherwise counsels, exhortations, commands, prohibitions, rewards, and punishments would be in vain. In order to make this evident, we must observe that some things act without judgment; as a stone moves downwards; and in like manner all things which lack <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And some act from judgment, but not a free judgment; as brute animals. For the sheep, seeing the wolf, judges it a thing to be shunned, from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and not a free judgment, because it judges, not from <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>. And the same thing is to be said of any judgment of brute animals. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acts from judgment, because by his apprehensive power he judges that something should be avoided or sought. But because this judgment, in the case of some particular act, is not from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, but from some act of comparison in the reason, therefore he acts from free judgment and retains the power of being inclined to various things. For reason in contingent matters may follow opposite courses, as we see in dialectic syllogisms and rhetorical arguments. Now particular operations are <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>, and therefore in such matters the judgment of reason may follow opposite courses, and is not determinate to one. And forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is rational is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As we have said above (81, 3, ad 2), the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, though it obeys the reason, yet in a given case can resist by desiring what the reason forbids. This is therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not when he wishes--namely, "not to desire against reason," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> are not to be taken as though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not wish or does not run of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, but because the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is not sufficient thereto unless it be moved and helped by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">Free-will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its own movement, because by his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> moves himself to act. But it does not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> belong to liberty that what is free should be the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of itself, as neither for one thing to be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another need it be the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, is the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, Who moves <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. And just as by moving <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> He does not prevent their acts being <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, so by moving <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> He does not deprive their actions of being <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>: but rather is He the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> "Man's way" is said "not to be his" in the execution of his choice, wherein he may be impeded, whether he will or not. The choice itself, however, is in us, but presupposes the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Quality in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is of two kinds: <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and adventitious. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> may be in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part, or in the body and its powers. From the very fact, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is such by virtue of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part, he <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires his last end, which is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Which desire, indeed, is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire, and is not subject to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, as is clear from what we have said above (82, 1,2). But on the part of the body and its powers <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be such by virtue of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, inasmuch as he is of such a temperament or disposition due to any impression whatever produced by corporeal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, which cannot affect the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part, since it is not the act of a corporeal organ. And such as a man is by virtue of a corporeal <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, such also does his end seem to him, because from such a disposition a man is inclined to choose or reject something. But these inclinations are subject to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> obeys, as we have said (81, 3). Wherefore this is in no way prejudicial to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p>The adventitious <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, by virtue of which a man is inclined to one thing rather than to another. And yet even these inclinations are subject to the judgment of reason. Such <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, too, are subject to reason, as it is in our power either to acquire them, whether by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> them or disposing ourselves to them, or to reject them. And so there is nothing in this that is repugnant to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether free-will is a power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is not a power. For <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is nothing but a free judgment. But judgment denominates an act, not a power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is not a power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is defined as "the faculty of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and reason." But faculty denominates a facility of power, which is due to a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Moreover <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> says (De Gratia et Lib. Arb. 1,2) that <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of disposing of itself." Therefore it is not a power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power is forfeited through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is forfeited through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by abusing <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, loses both it and himself." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is not a power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Nothing but a power, seemingly, is the subject of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by the help of which it chooses what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is a power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> [Liberum arbitrium--i.e. free judgment] in its strict sense denotes an act, in the common manner of speaking we call <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, that which is the principle of the act by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judges freely. Now in us the principle of an act is both power and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; for we say that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something both by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> must be either a power or a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, or a power with a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. That it is neither a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> nor a power together with a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, can be clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in two ways.

<p>First of all, because, if it is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, it must be a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; for it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. But there is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in us with respect to those things which come under <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>: for we are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> inclined to those things of which we have <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>--for instance, to assent to first principles: while those things which we are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> inclined are not subject to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, as we have said of the desire of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> (82, 1,2). Wherefore it is against the very notion of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> that it should be a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. And that it should be a non-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is against its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore in no sense is it a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p>Secondly, this is clear because <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are defined as that "by reason of which we are well or ill disposed with regard to actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>" (Ethic. ii, 5); for by <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> we are well-disposed as regards <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, and by intemperance ill-disposed: and by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> we are well-disposed to the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> when we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and by the contrary ill-disposed. But the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is indifferent to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> choice: wherefore it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Therefore it is a power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not unusual for a power to be named from its act. And so from this act, which is a free judgment, is named the power which is the principle of this act. Otherwise, if <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> denominated an act, it would not always remain in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Faculty sometimes denominates a power ready for operation, and in this sense faculty is used in the definition of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> takes <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, not as divided against power, but as signifying a certain aptitude by which a man has some sort of relation to an act. And this may be both by a power and by a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: for by a power <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is, as it were, empowered to do the action, and by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> he is apt to act well or ill.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is said to have lost <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> by falling into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not as to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> liberty, which is freedom from coercion, but as regards freedom from fault and unhappiness. Of this we shall treat later in the treatise on Morals in the second part of this work (I-II, 85, seqq.; 109).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether free-will is an appetitive power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is not an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>, but a cognitive power. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 27) says that "<a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> straightway accompanies the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." But reason is a cognitive power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is a cognitive power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is so called as though it were a free judgment. But to judge is an act of a cognitive power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is a cognitive power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the principal function of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is to choose. But choice seems to belong to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, because it implies a certain comparison of one thing to another, which belongs to the cognitive power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is a cognitive power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 3) that choice is "the desire of those things which are in us." But desire is an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power: therefore choice is also. But <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is that by which we choose. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The proper act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is choice: for we say that we have a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> because we can take one thing while refusing another; and this is to choose. Therefore we must consider the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, by considering the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of choice. Now two things concur in choice: one on the part of the cognitive power, the other on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. On the part of the cognitive power, counsel is required, by which we judge one thing to be preferred to another: and on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, it is required that the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> should accept the judgment of counsel. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Ethic. vi, 2) leaves it in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether choice belongs principally to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> or the cognitive power: since he says that choice is either "an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>." But (Ethic. iii, 3) he inclines to its being an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> when he describes choice as "a desire proceeding from counsel." And the reason of this is because the proper object of choice is the means to the end: and this, as such, is in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is called useful: wherefore since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as such, is the object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, it follows that choice is principally an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. And thus <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers accompany the apprehensive, and in this sense <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says that <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> straightway accompanies the rational power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Judgment, as it were, concludes and terminates counsel. Now counsel is terminated, first, by the judgment of reason; secondly, by the acceptation of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: whence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 3) says that, "having formed a judgment by counsel, we desire in accordance with that counsel." And in this sense choice itself is a judgment from which <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> takes its name.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This comparison which is implied in the choice belongs to the preceding counsel, which is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. For though the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> does not make comparisons, yet forasmuch as it is moved by the apprehensive power which does compare, it has some likeness of comparison by choosing one in preference to another.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether free-will is a power distinct from the will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is a power distinct from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that <em>thelesis</em> is one thing and <em>boulesis</em> another. But <em>thelesis</em> is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, while <em>boulesis</em> seems to be the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, because <em>boulesis</em>, according to him, is will as concerning an object by way of comparison between two things. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is a distinct power from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, powers are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their acts. But choice, which is the act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, is distinct from the act of willing, because "the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> regards the end, whereas choice regards the means to the end" (Ethic. iii, 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is a distinct power from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> there are two powers--the active and the passive. Therefore, also on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, there must be another power besides the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And this, seemingly, can only be <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is a distinct power from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 14) <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is nothing else than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers must be proportionate to the apprehensive powers, as we have said above (Question 64, Article 2). Now, as on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> apprehension we have <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and reason, so on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> we have will, and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> which is nothing else but the power of choice. And this is clear from their relations to their respective objects and acts. For the act of "understanding" implies the simple acceptation of something; whence we say that we understand first principles, which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of themselves without any comparison. But to "reason," properly speaking, is to come from one thing to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of another: wherefore, properly speaking, we reason about conclusions, which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from the principles. In like manner on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to "will" implies the simple <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for something: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is said to regard the end, which is desired for itself. But to "choose" is to desire something for the sake of obtaining something else: wherefore, properly speaking, it regards the means to the end. Now, in matters of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the principles are related to the conclusion to which we assent on account of the principles: just as, in <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> matters, the end is related to the means, which is desired on account of the end. Wherefore it is evident that as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is to reason, so is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to the power of choice, which is <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. But it has been shown above (Question 79, Article 8) that it belongs to the same power both to understand and to reason, even as it belongs to the same power to be at rest and to be in movement. Wherefore it belongs also to the same power to will and to choose: and on this account the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> are not two powers, but one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <em>Boulesis</em> is distinct from <em>thelesis</em> on account of a distinction, not of powers, but of acts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Choice and will--that is, the act of willing --are different acts: yet they belong to the same power, as also to understand and to reason, as we have said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is compared to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as moving the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And therefore there is no need to distinguish in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> an active and a passive will.
