<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether prayer is an act of the appetitive power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. It belongs to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to be heard. Now it is the desire that is heard by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse38">Psalm 9:38</a>, "The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is desire. But desire is an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power: and therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iii): "It is useful to begin everything with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, because thereby we surrender ourselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and unite ourselves to Him." Now union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is effected by love which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (De Anima iii, 6) that there are two operations of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part. Of these the first is "the understanding of indivisibles," by which operation we apprehend what a thing is: while the second is "synthesis" and "analysis," whereby we apprehend that a thing is or is not. To these a third may be added, namely, "reasoning," whereby we proceed from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the unknown. Now <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not reducible to any of these operations. Therefore it is an operation, not of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x) that "to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> is to speak." Now speech belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is an act, not of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> [Comment. in <a href="../bible/psa038.htm#verse13">Psalm 38:13</a> "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> [oratio] is spoken reason [oris ratio]." Now the speculative and practical reason differ in this, that the speculative merely apprehends its object, whereas the practical reason not only apprehends but <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Now one thing is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another in two ways: first perfectly, when it necessitates its effect, and this happens when the effect is wholly subject to the power of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; secondly imperfectly, by merely disposing to the effect, for the reason that the effect is not wholly subject to the power of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Accordingly in this way the reason is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of certain things in two ways: first, by imposing <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; and in this way it belongs to reason, to command not only the lower powers and the members of the body, but also <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> subjects, which indeed is done by commanding; secondly, by leading up to the effect, and, in a way, disposing to it, and in this sense the reason asks for something to be done by things not subject to it, whether they be its equals or its superiors. Now both of these, namely, to command and to ask or beseech, imply a certain ordering, seeing that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> proposes something to be effected by something else, wherefore they pertain to the reason to which it belongs to set in order. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 13) that the "reason exhorts us to do what is best."

<p>Now in the present instance we are speaking of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> [This last paragraph refers to the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> word 'oratio' [<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>] which originally signified a speech, being derived in the first instance from 'os,' 'oris' (the mouth).] as signifying a beseeching or petition, in which sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [<a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus</a>, De Univ. vi, 14: says (De Verb. Dom.) that "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is a petition," and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> states (De Fide Orth. iii, 24) that "to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> is to ask becoming things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Accordingly it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as we speak of it now, is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Lord is said to hear the desire of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, either because desire is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their petition, since a petition is like the interpreter of a desire, or in order to show how speedily they are heard, since no sooner do the poor desire something than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hears them before they put up a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, according to the saying of <a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse24">Isaiah 65:24</a>, "And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will hear."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (I, 82, 4; I-II, 9, 1, ad 3), the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves the reason to its end: wherefore nothing hinders the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, under the motion of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, from tending to an end such as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> tends to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through being moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as it were, and this in two ways. First, on the part of the object of our petition, because when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> we ought principally to ask to be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa026.htm#verse4">Psalm 26:4</a>, "One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life." Secondly, on the part of the petitioner, who ought to approach the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whom he petitions, either locally, as when he petitions a man, or <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a>, as when he petitions <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iii) that "when we call upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, we unveil our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in His presence": and in the same sense <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 24) that "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is the raising up of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These three acts belong to the speculative reason, but to the practical reason it belongs in addition to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> something by way of command or of petition, as stated above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is becoming to pray?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is unbecoming to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> seems to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order that we may make our needs <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. But according to <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse32">Matthew 6:32</a>, "Your Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> that you have need of all these things." Therefore it is not becoming to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> we bend the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, so that he may do what is asked of him. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mind is unchangeable and inflexible, according to <a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#verse29">1 Samuel 15:29</a>, "But the Triumpher in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> will not spare, and will not be moved to repentance." Therefore it is not fitting that we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is more liberal to give to one that asks not, than to one who asks because, according to Seneca (De Benefic. ii, 1), "nothing is bought more dearly than what is bought with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely liberal. Therefore it would seem unbecoming to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse1">Luke 18:1</a>): "We ought always to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and not to faint."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Among the ancients there was a threefold <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Some held that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs are not ruled by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>; whence it would follow that it is useless to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at all: of these it is written (<a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse14">Malachi 3:14</a>): "You have said: He laboreth in vain that serveth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Another opinion held that all things, even in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, happen of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, whether by reason of the unchangeableness of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, or through the compelling influence of the stars, or on account of the connection of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: and this opinion also excluded the utility of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. There was a third opinion of those who held that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs are indeed ruled by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, and that they do not happen of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; yet they deemed the disposition of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> to be changeable, and that it is changed by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and other things pertaining to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All these opinions were disproved in I, 19, 7,8; I, 22, 2,4; I, 115, 6; I, 116. Wherefore it behooves us so to account for the utility of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> as neither to impose <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, nor to imply changeableness on the part of the Divine disposition.

<p>In order to throw light on this question we must consider that <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> disposes not only what effects shall take place, but also from what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> and in what order these effects shall proceed. Now among other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of certain effects. Wherefore it must be that men do certain actions. not that thereby they may change the Divine disposition, but that by those actions they may achieve certain effects according to the order of the Divine disposition: and the same is to be said of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. And so is it with regard to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> not that we may change the Divine disposition, but that we may impetrate that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has disposed to be fulfilled by our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in other words "that by asking, men may deserve to receive what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> has disposed to give," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. i, 8)

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We need to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not in order to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to Him our needs or desires but that we ourselves may be reminded of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of having recourse to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help in these matters.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above, our motive in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> is, not Divine disposition, we may change the Divine disposition, but that, by our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, we may obtain what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has appointed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bestows many things on us out of His liberality, even without our asking for them: but that He wishes to bestow certain things on us at our asking, is for the sake of our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely, that we may acquire confidence in having recourse to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that we may recognize in Him the Author of our goods. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Implicitly [Hom. ii, de Orat.: Hom. xxx in Genes.]; Cf. Caten. Aur. on <a href="../bible/luk018.htm">Luke 18</a>: "Think what <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is granted thee, what <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> bestowed on thee, when thou conversest with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, when thou talkest with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when thou askest what thou wilt, whatever thou desirest."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether prayer is an act of religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not an act of religion. Since religion is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, it resides in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as in its subject.

<p>But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> seems to be an act, not of religion, but of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding whereby the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> ascends to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the act of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" falls under a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of precept.

<p>But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> does not seem to come under a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of precept, but to come from the mere will, since it is nothing else than a petition for what we will. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> seemingly is not an act of religion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems to belong to religion that one "offers worship end ceremonial rites to the Godhead" [Cicero, Rhet. ii, 53. But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> seems not to offer anything to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to. ask to obtain something from Him. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not an act of religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa140.htm#verse2">Psalm 140:2</a>): "Let my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be directed as <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> in Thy sight": and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the passage says that "it was to signify this that under the old Law <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> was said to be offered for a sweet smell to the Lord." Now this belongs to religion. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is an act of religion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (81, 2,4), it belongs properly to religion to show <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherefore all those things through which reverence is shown to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, belong to religion. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shows reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, in so far as he subjects himself to Him, and by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> confesses that he needs Him as the Author of his goods. Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is properly an act of religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The will moves the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to its end, as stated above (82, 1, ad 1), and therefore religion, which is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, directs the acts of the other powers to the reverence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now among the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the highest, and the nearest to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; and consequently after devotion which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part is the chief of the acts of religion, since by it religion directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is a matter of precept not only that we should ask for what we desire, but also that we should desire aright. But to desire comes under a precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereas to ask comes under a precept of religion, which precept is expressed in <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse7">Matthew 7:7</a>, where it is said: "Ask and ye shall receive" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Ask and it shall be given you.'].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> surrenders his mind to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since he subjects it to Him with reverence and, so to speak, presents it to Him, as appears from the words of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> quoted above (1, Objection 1). Wherefore just as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind excels exterior things, whether bodily members, or those external things that are employed for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service, so too, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> surpasses other acts of religion.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether we ought to pray to God alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> is an act of religion, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is to be worshiped by religion. Therefore we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is useless to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to one who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. But it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> one's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, both because frequently <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is uttered by an interior act which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, rather than by words, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>), "I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with the spirit, I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> also with the understanding": and again because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Cura pro mortuis xiii) the "dead, even the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what the living, even their own children, are doing." Therefore we ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to any of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, this is only because they are united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now some yet living in this world, or even some who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, are closely united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and yet we do not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to them. Therefore neither should we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are in Paradise.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job005.htm#verse1">Job 5:1</a>), "Call . . . if there be any that will answer thee, and turn to some of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> is offered to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in two ways: first, as to be fulfilled by him, secondly, as to be obtained through him. On the first way we offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, since all our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> ought to be directed to the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone gives, according to <a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse12">Psalm 83:12</a>, "The Lord will give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." But in the second way we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or men, not that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may through them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> our petitions, but that our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> may be effective through their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rev008.htm#verse4">Apocalypse 8:4</a>) that "the smoke of the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>," namely "the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> ascended up before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." This is also clear from the very style employed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>: since we beseech the Blessed <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> "to have mercy on us," while we ask any of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> "to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To Him alone do we offer religious worship when <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, from Whom we seek to obtain what we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for, because by so doing we confess that He is the Author of our goods: but not to those whom we call upon as our advocates in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> presence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The dead, if we consider their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what takes place in this world, especially the interior movements of the heart. Nevertheless, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xii, 21), whatever it is fitting the blessed should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about what happens to us, even as regards the interior movements of the heart, is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them in the Word: and it is most becoming to their exalted position that they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the petitions we make to them by word or thought; and consequently the petitions which we raise to them are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them through Divine manifestation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who are in this world or in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, do not yet enjoy the vision of the Word, so as to be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what we think or say. Wherefore we do not seek their assistance by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to them, but ask it of the living by speaking to them.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether we ought to ask for something definite when we pray?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought not to ask for anything definite when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iii, 24), "to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> is to ask becoming things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; wherefore it is useless to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for what is inexpedient, according to <a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse3">James 4:3</a>, "You ask, and receive not: because you ask amiss." Now according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse26">Romans 8:26</a>, "we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought." Therefore we ought not to ask for anything definite when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those who ask another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for something definite strive to incline his will to do what they wish themselves. But we ought not to endeavor to make <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will what we will; on the contrary, we ought to strive to will what He wills, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa032.htm#verse1">Psalm 32:1</a>, "Rejoice in the Lord, O ye just." Therefore we ought not to ask <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for anything definite when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things are not to be sought from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and as to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself invites us to take them. Now it is useless to ask a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to give you what he invites you to take. Therefore we ought not to ask <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for anything definite in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm">Matthew 6</a> and <a href="../bible/luk011.htm">Luke 11</a>) taught His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to ask definitely for those things which are contained in the petitions of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to Valerius Maximus [Fact. et Dict. Memor. vii, 2, "<a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> deemed that we should ask the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods for nothing else but that they should grant us <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, because they at any rate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for each one whereas when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> we frequently ask for what it had been better for us not to obtain." This opinion is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to a certain extent, as to those things which may have an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> result, and which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may use ill or well, such as "<a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, by which," as stated by the same authority (Fact. et Dict. Memor. vii, 2), "many have come to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end; honors, which have ruined many; power, of which we frequently witness the unhappy results; splendid marriages, which sometimes bring about the total wreck of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>." Nevertheless there are certain goods which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot ill use, because they cannot have an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> result. Such are those which are the object of beatitude and whereby we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> it: and these the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> seek absolutely when they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, as in <a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse4">Psalm 79:4</a>, "Show us Thy face, and we shall be saved," and again in <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse35">Psalm 118:35</a>, "Lead me into the path of Thy commandments."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot by himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for, "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>," as stated in the same passage, "helpeth our infirmity," since by inspiring us with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> desires, He makes us ask for what is right. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John 4:24</a>) that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> adorers "must <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> . . . in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> we ask for things concerning our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, we conform our will to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>, of Whom it is written (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 2:4</a>) that "He will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so invites us to take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, that we may approach to them not by the steps of the body, but by pious desires and devout <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether man ought to ask God for temporal things when he prays?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought not to ask <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for temporal things when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>. We seek what we ask for in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. But we should not seek for temporal things, for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse33">Matthew 6:33</a>): "Seek ye . . . first the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and all these things shall be added unto you," that is to say, temporal things, which, says He, we are not to seek, but they will be added to what we seek. Therefore temporal things are not to be asked of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one asks save for that which he is solicitous about. Now we ought not to have solicitude for temporal things, according to the saying of <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse25">Matthew 6:25</a>, "Be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat." Therefore we ought not to ask for temporal things when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> should be raised up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But by asking for temporal things, it descends to things beneath it, against the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse18">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>), "While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought not to ask <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for temporal things when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought not to ask of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> other than <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and useful things. But sometimes temporal things, when we have them, are harmful, not only in a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense, but also in a material sense. Therefore we should not ask <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for them in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse8">Proverbs 30:8</a>): "Give me only the necessaries of life."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad Probam, de orando Deum, Ep. cxxx, 12): "It is lawful to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for what it is lawful to desire." Now it is lawful to desire temporal things, not indeed principally, by placing our end therein, but as helps whereby we are assisted in tending towards beatitude, in so far, to wit, as they are the means of supporting the life of the body, and are of service to us as instruments in performing acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as also the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. i, 8). <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> too says the same to Proba (ad Probam, de orando Deum, Ep. cxxx, 6,7) when he states that "it is not unbecoming for anyone to desire enough for a livelihood, and no more; for this sufficiency is desired, not for its own sake, but for the welfare of the body, or that we should desire to be clothed in a way befitting one's station, so as not to be out of keeping with those among whom we have to live. Accordingly we ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may keep these things if we have them, and if we have them not, that we may gain possession of them."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We should seek temporal things not in the first but in the second place. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 16): "When He says that this" (i.e. the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>) "is to be sought first, He implies that the other" (i.e. temporal goods) "is to be sought afterwards, not in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> but in importance, this as being our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the other as our need."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not all solicitude about temporal things is forbidden, but that which is superfluous and inordinate, as stated above (<a href="../summa/3055.htm#article6">Question 55, Article 6</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is intent on temporal things in order that it may rest in them, it remains immersed therein; but when it is intent on them in relation to the acquisition of beatitude, it is not lowered by them, but raises them to a higher level.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> From the very fact that we ask for temporal things not as the principal object of our petition, but as subordinate to something else, we ask <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for them in the sense that they may be granted to us in so far as they are expedient for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether we ought to pray for others?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for others. On <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> we ought to conform to the pattern given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>. Now in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> we make petitions for ourselves, not for others; thus we say: "Give us this day our daily bread," etc. Therefore we should not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is offered that it may be heard. Now one of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> required for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that it may be heard is that one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for oneself, wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse23">John 16:23</a>, "If you ask the Father anything in My name He will give it you," says (Tract. cii): "Everyone is heard when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for himself, not when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for all; wherefore He does not say simply 'He will give it,' but 'He will give it you. '" Therefore it would seem that we ought not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for others, but only for ourselves.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we are forbidden to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for others, if they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse16">Jeremiah 7:16</a>, "Therefore do not then <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for this people . . . and do not withstand Me, for I will not hear thee." On the other hand we are not bound to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since they are heard when they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for themselves. Therefore it would seem that we ought not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse16">James 5:16</a>): "Pray one for another, that you may be saved."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>), when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> we ought to ask for what we ought to desire. Now we ought to desire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things not only for ourselves, but also for others: for this is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the love which we owe to our neighbor, as stated above (25, 1 and 2; 27, 2; 31, 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> requires us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for others. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xiv in Matth.) [Opus Imperfectum, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>]: "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">Necessity</a> binds us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for ourselves, fraternal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> urges us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for others: and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that fraternal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> proffers is sweeter to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than that which is the outcome of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says (De orat. Dom.), "We say 'Our Father' and not 'My Father,' 'Give us' and not 'Give me,' because the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master of unity</a> did not wish us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> privately, that is for ourselves alone, for He wished each one to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for all, even as He Himself bore all in one."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for oneself: not as though it were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, but as being <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> may not fail in its effect of impetration. For it sometimes happens that we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for another with piety and perseverance, and ask for things relating to his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and yet it is not granted on account of some obstacle on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> we are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for, according to <a href="../bible/jer015.htm#verse1">Jeremiah 15:1</a>, "If <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Samuel shall stand before Me, My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not towards this people." And yet the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> will be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> thus out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa034.htm#verse13">Psalm 34:13</a>, "My <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall be turned into my bosom, i.e. though it profit them not, I am not deprived of my reward," as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> We ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> even for sinners, that they may be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, and for the just that they may persevere and advance in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Yet those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> are heard not for all sinners but for some: since they are heard for the predestined, but not for those who are foreknown to death; even as the correction whereby we correct the brethren, has an effect in the predestined but not in the reprobate, according to <a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse14">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>, "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can correct whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath despised." Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse16">1 John 5:16</a>): "He that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> his brother to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is not to death, let him ask, and life shall be given to him, who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a> not to death." Now just as the benefit of correction must not be refused to any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> so long as he lives here below, because we cannot distinguish the predestined from the reprobate, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Correp. et Grat. xv), so too no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be denied the help of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p>We ought also to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the just for three reasons: First, because the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of a multitude are more easily heard, wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse30">Romans 15:30</a>, "Help me in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>," says: "The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> rightly tells the lesser brethren to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him, for many lesser ones, if they be united together in one mind, become great, and it is impossible for the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of a multitude not to obtain" that which is possible to be obtained by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Secondly, that many may thank <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> conferred on the just, which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> conduce to the profit of many, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse11">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>). Thirdly, that the more perfect may not wax proud, seeing that they find that they need the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the less perfect.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether we ought to pray for our enemies?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for our enemies. According to <a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse4">Romans 15:4</a>, "what things soever were written, were written for our learning." Now <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> contains many imprecations against enemies; thus it is written (<a href="../bible/psa006.htm#verse11">Psalm 6:11</a>): "Let all my enemies be ashamed and be . . . troubled, let them be ashamed and be troubled very speedily [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Let them be turned back and be ashamed.']." Therefore we too should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> against rather than for our enemies.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to be revenged on one's enemies is harmful to them. But <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men seek vengeance of their enemies according to <a href="../bible/rev006.htm#verse10">Apocalypse 6:10</a>, "How long . . . dost Thou not . . . revenge our blood on them that dwell on earth?" Wherefore they rejoice in being revenged on their enemies, according to <a href="../bible/psa057.htm#verse11">Psalm 57:11</a>, "The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge." Therefore we should not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for our enemies, but against them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> should not be contrary to his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Now sometimes men lawfully attack their enemies, else all <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> would be unlawful, which is opposed to what we have said above (Question 40, Article 1). Therefore we should not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for our enemies.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew 5:44</a>): "Pray for them that persecute and calumniate you."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for another is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). Wherefore we are bound to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for our enemies in the same manner as we are bound to love them. Now it was explained above in the treatise on <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> (25, 8,9), how we are bound to love our enemies, namely, that we must love in them their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. and that to love our enemies in general is a matter of precept, while to love them in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is not a matter of precept, except in the preparedness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so that a man must be prepared to love his enemy even in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> and to help him in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, or if his enemy should beg his forgiveness. But to love one's enemies absolutely in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and to assist them, is an act of perfection.

<p>In like manner it is a matter of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> that we should not exclude our enemies from the general <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which we offer up for others: but it is a matter of perfection, and not of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them individually, except in certain special cases.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The imprecations contained in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> may be understood in four ways. First, according to the custom of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> "to foretell the future under the veil of an imprecation," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states [De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 21. Secondly, in the sense that certain temporal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are sometimes inflicted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> for their correction. Thirdly, because they are understood to be pronounced, not against the men themselves, but against the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, with the purpose, to wit, of destroying <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the correction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Fourthly, by way of conformity of our will to the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> with regard to the damnation of those who are obstinate in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states in the same book (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 22), "the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>' vengeance is the overthrow of the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because they suffered so much while it reigned": or as he says again (QQ. Vet. et Nov. Test. lxviii), "their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for vengeance is expressed not in words but in their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>, even as the blood of <a href="../cathen/01035c.htm">Abel</a> cried from the earth." They rejoice in vengeance not for its own sake, but for the sake of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is lawful to attack one's enemies, that they may be restrained from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and this is for their own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others. Consequently it is even lawful in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to ask that temporal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> be inflicted on our enemies in order that they may mend their ways. Thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> will not be contrary to one another.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether the seven petitions of the Lord's Prayer are fittingly assigned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the seven petitions of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> are not fittingly assigned. It is useless to ask for that to be hallowed which is always <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. But the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is always <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse49">Luke 1:49</a>, "Holy is His name." Again, His kingdom is everlasting, according to <a href="../bible/psa144.htm#verse13">Psalm 144:13</a>, "Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages." Again, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is always fulfilled, according to <a href="../bible/isa046.htm#verse10">Isaiah 46:10</a>, "All My will shall be done." Therefore it is useless to ask for "the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be hallowed," for "His kingdom to come," and for "His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to be done."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one must withdraw from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before attaining <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore it seems unfitting for the petitions relating to the attainment of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be set forth before those relating to the removal of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one asks for a thing that it may be given to one. Now the chief <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and those <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> that we receive through Him. Therefore the petitions seem to be unfittingly assigned, since they do not correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, according to Luke, only five petitions are mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, as appears from the <a href="../bible/luk011.htm">eleventh chapter</a>. Therefore it was superfluous for Matthew to mention seven.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it seems useless to seek to win the benevolence of one who forestalls us by his benevolence. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forestalls us by His benevolence, since "He first hath loved us" (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse19">1 John 4:19</a>). Therefore it is useless to preface the petitions with the words our "Father Who art in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," which seem to indicate a desire to win <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> benevolence.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The authority of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who composed this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, suffices.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> is most perfect, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad Probam Ep. cxxx, 12), "if we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> rightly and fittingly, we can say nothing else but what is contained in this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>." For since <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> interprets our desires, as it were, before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then alone is it right to ask for something in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> when it is right that we should desire it. Now in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> not only do we ask for all that we may rightly desire, but also in the order wherein we ought to desire them, so that this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> not only teaches us to ask, but also directs all our affections. Thus it is evident that the first thing to be the object of our desire is the end, and afterwards whatever is directed to the end. Now our end is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> towards Whom our affections tend in two ways: first, by our willing the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, secondly, by willing to enjoy His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. The first belongs to the love whereby we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Himself, while the second belongs to the love whereby we love ourselves in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore the first petition is expressed thus: "Hallowed be Thy name," and the second thus: "Thy kingdom come," by which we ask to come to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His kingdom.

<p>To this same end a thing directs us in two ways: in one way, by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in another way, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is useful for an end directs us to that end. Now a thing is useful in two ways to that end which is beatitude: in one way, directly and principally, according to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> beatitude by obeying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in this respect we ask: "Thy will be done on earth as it is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>"; in another way instrumentally, and as it were helping us to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, and in this respect we say: "Give us this day our daily bread," whether we understand this of the sacramental Bread, the daily use of which is profitable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and in which all the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are contained, or of the bread of the body, so that it denotes all sufficiency of food, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad Probam, Ep. cxxx, 11), since the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is the chief sacrament, and bread is the chief food: thus in the Gospel of Matthew we read, "supersubstantial," i.e. "principal," as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> expounds it.

<p>We are directed to beatitude <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> by the removal of obstacles. Now there are three obstacles to our attainment of beatitude. First, there is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which directly excludes a man from the kingdom, according to <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 6:9-10</a>, "Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, etc., shall possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>"; and to this refer the words, "Forgive us our trespasses." Secondly, there is <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> which hinders us from keeping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, and to this we refer when we say: "And lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>," whereby we do not ask not to be tempted, but not to be conquered by <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, which is to be led into temptation. Thirdly, there is the present penal state which is a kind of obstacle to a sufficiency of life, and to this we refer in the words, "Deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 5), when we say, "Hallowed be Thy name, we do not mean that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> name is not <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, but we ask that men may treat it as a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing," and this pertains to the diffusion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> among men. When we say, "Thy kingdom come, we do not imply that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not reigning now," but "we excite in ourselves the desire for that kingdom, that it may come to us, and that we may reign therein," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad Probam, Ep. cxxx, 11). The words, "Thy will be done rightly signify, 'May Thy commandments be obeyed' on earth as in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, i.e. by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as well as by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>" (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 6). Hence these three petitions will be perfectly fulfilled in the life to come; while the other four, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion cxv), belong to the needs of the present life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is the interpreter of desire, the order of the petitions corresponds with the order, not of execution, but of desire or <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, where the end precedes the things that are directed to the end, and attainment of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> precedes removal of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 11) adapts the seven petitions to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>. He says: "If it is fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whereby blessed are the poor in spirit, let us ask that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> name be hallowed among men with a chaste fear. If it is piety whereby blessed are the meek, let us ask that His kingdom may come, so that we become meek and no longer resist Him. If it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby blessed are they that mourn, let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be done, for thus we shall mourn no more. If it is <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> whereby blessed ere they that hunger, let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that our daily bread be given to us. If it is counsel whereby blessed are the merciful, let us forgive the trespasses of others that our own may be forgiven. If it is understanding whereby blessed are the pure in heart, let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> lest we have a double heart by seeking after worldly things which ere the occasion of our <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. If it is wisdom whereby blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to be delivered from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: for if we be delivered we shall by that very fact become the free children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion cxvi), "Luke included not seven but five petitions in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, for by omitting it, he shows that the third petition is a kind of repetition of the two that precede, and thus helps us to understand it"; because, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> tends chiefly to this--that we come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and to reign together with Him. Again the last petition mentioned by Matthew, "Deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," is omitted by Luke, so that each one may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> himself to be delivered from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> if he be not led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> is offered up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not that we may bend Him, but that we may excite in ourselves the confidence to ask: which confidence is excited in us chiefly by the consideration of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in our regard, whereby he wills our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--wherefore we say: "Our Father"; and of His excellence, whereby He is able to fulfil it--wherefore we say: "Who art in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>."

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether prayer is proper to the rational creature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not proper to the rational creature. Asking and receiving apparently belong to the same subject. But receiving is becoming also to uncreated Persons, viz. the Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore it is competent to them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: for the Son said (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse16">John 14:16</a>): "I will ask My [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the'] Father," and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse26">Romans 8:26</a>): "The Spirit . . . asketh for us."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Angels are above rational creatures, since they are <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is becoming to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, wherefore we read in the <a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse7">Psalm 96:7</a>: "Adore Him, all you His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not proper to the rational creature.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same subject is fitted to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> as is fitted to call upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since this consists chiefly in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. But dumb animals are fitted to call upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa146.htm#verse9">Psalm 146:9</a>, "Who giveth to beasts their food and to the young ravens that call upon Him." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not proper to the rational creatures.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But the rational creature is so called from his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is proper to the rational creature.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and consists in beseeching a superior; just as command is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whereby an inferior is directed to something. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is properly competent to one to whom it is competent to have reason, and a superior whom he may beseech. Now nothing is above the Divine Persons; and dumb animals are devoid of reason. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is unbecoming both the Divine Persons and dumb animals, and it is proper to the rational creature.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Receiving belongs to the Divine Persons in respect of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> belongs to one who receives through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. The Son is said to ask or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in respect of His assumed, i.e. His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and not in respect of His Godhead: and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is said to ask, because He makes us ask.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated in I, 79, 8, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and reason are not distinct powers in us: but they differ as the perfect from the imperfect. Hence <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> creatures which are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are distinct from rational creatures, and sometimes are included under them. On this sense <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is said to be proper to the rational creature.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The young ravens are said to call upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on account of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire whereby all things, each in its own way, desire to attain the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Thus too dumb animals are said to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on account of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> instinct whereby they are moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether the saints in heaven pray for us?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> do not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us. A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> action is more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> for himself than for others. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for themselves, neither do they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for themselves, since they are already established in the term. Neither therefore do they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> conform their will to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perfectly, so that they will only what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills. Now what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills is always fulfilled. Therefore it would be useless for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are above, so are those in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, for they can no longer <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now those in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> do not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, on the contrary we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them. Therefore neither do the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the higher <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> would be more efficacious; and so we ought not to implore the help of the lower <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>' <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> but only of those of the higher <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Peter is not Peter. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, so long as they are separated from their bodies, we ought not to call upon <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Saint Peter</a>, but on his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us: yet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does the contrary. The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> therefore do not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, at least before the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/2ma015.htm#verse14">2 Maccabees 15:14</a>): "This is . . . he that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayeth</a> much for the people, and for all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city, <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Cont. Vigilant. 6), the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Vigilantius consisted in saying that "while we live, we can <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> one for another; but that after we are dead, none of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for others can be heard, seeing that not even the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>' <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are granted when they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for their blood to be avenged." But this is absolutely <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because, since <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> offered for others proceed from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (A7,8), the greater the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, the more they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for wayfarers, since the latter can be helped by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>: and the more closely they are united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the more are their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> efficacious: for the Divine order is such that lower beings receive an overflow of the excellence of the higher, even as the air receives the brightness of the sun. Wherefore it is said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse25">Hebrews 7:25</a>): "Going to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by His own power . . . to make intercession for us" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'He is able to save for ever them that come to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by Him, always living to make intercession for us.']. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Cont. Vigilant. 6): "If the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> while yet in the body and having to be solicitous for themselves, can <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for others, how much more now that they have the crown of victory and triumph."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, since they are blessed, have no lack of bliss, save that of the body's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and for this they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. But they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us who lack the ultimate perfection of bliss: and their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are efficacious in impetrating through their previous <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> acceptance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> impetrate what ever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wishes to take place through their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>: and they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for that which they deem will be granted through their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> though they are above us on account of their impeccability, yet they are below us as to the pains which they suffer: and in this respect they are not in a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, but rather in a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> that requires us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will that inferior beings should be helped by all those that are above them, wherefore we ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> not only to the higher but also to the lower <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; else we should have to implore the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Nevertheless it happens sometime that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> addressed to a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> of lower degree are more efficacious, either because he is implored with greater devotion, or because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wishes to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his sanctity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> It is because the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> while living <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, that we invoke them under the names by which they were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in this life, and by which they are better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us: and also in order to indicate our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, according to the saying of <a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse6">Exodus 3:6</a>, "I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>," etc.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether prayer should be vocal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> ought not to be vocal. As stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is addressed chiefly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the language of the heart. Therefore it is useless to employ vocal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should lift <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (1, ad 2). But words, like other sensible objects, prevent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from ascending to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Therefore we should not use words in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should be offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in secret, according to <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse6">Matthew 6:6</a>, "But thou, when thou shalt <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, enter into thy chamber, and having shut the door, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to thy Father in secret." But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> loses its secrecy by being expressed vocally. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should not be vocal.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa141.htm#verse2">Psalm 141:2</a>): "I cried to the Lord with my voice, with my voice I made supplication to the Lord."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> is twofold, common and <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Common <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is that which is offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> representing the body of the faithful: wherefore such like <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the whole people for whom it is offered: and this would not be possible unless it were vocal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Therefore it is reasonably ordained that the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should say these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> even in a loud voice, so that they may come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all.

<p>On the other hand <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is that which is offered by any single <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, whether he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for himself or for others; and it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to such a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> as this that it be vocal. And yet the voice is employed in such like <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for three reasons. First, in order to excite interior devotion, whereby the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> is raised to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because by means of external signs, whether of words or of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is moved as regards apprehension, and consequently also as regards the affections. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad Probam. Ep. cxxx, 9) that "by means of words and other signs we arouse ourselves more effectively to an increase of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> desires." Hence then alone should we use words and such like signs when they help to excite the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> internally. But if they distract or in any way impede the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> we should abstain from them; and this happens chiefly to those whose mind is sufficiently prepared for devotion without having recourse to those signs. Wherefore the Psalmist (<a href="../bible/psa026.htm#verse8">Psalm 26:8</a>) said: "My heart hath said to Thee: 'My face hath sought Thee,'" and we read of Anna (<a href="../bible/1sa001.htm#verse13">1 Samuel 1:13</a>) that "she spoke in her heart." Secondly, the voice is used in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> as though to pay a debt, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with all that he has from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is to say, not only with his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but also with his body: and this applies to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> considered especially as satisfactory. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/hos014.htm#verse3">Hosea 14:3</a>): "Take away all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and receive the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and we will render the calves of our lips." Thirdly, we have recourse to vocal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, through a certain overflow from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into the body, through excess of feeling, according to <a href="../bible/psa015.htm#verse9">Psalm 15:9</a>, "My heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Vocal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is employed, not in order to tell <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> something He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but in order to lift up the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> or of other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Words about other matters distract the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and hinder the devotion of those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: but words signifying some object of devotion lift up the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, especially one that is less devout.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Hom. xiii in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>], "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> forbids one to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in presence of others in order that one may be seen by others. Hence when you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, do nothing strange to draw men's attention, either by shouting so as to be heard by others, or by openly striking the heart, or extending the hands, so as to be seen by many. And yet, "according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 3), "it is not wrong to be seen by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but to do this or that in order to be seen by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>."

<h2 id="article13">Article 13. Whether attention is a necessary condition of prayer?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that attention is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. It is written (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John 4:24</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a spirit, and they that <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Him must <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Him in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not in spirit unless it be attentive. Therefore attention is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is "the ascent of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" [Damascene, De Fide Orth. iii, 24. But the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> does not ascend to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> if the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is inattentive. Therefore attention is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that it should be altogether sinless. Now if a man allows his mind to wander while <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> he is not free of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for he seems to make light of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; even as if he were to speak to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without attending to what he was saying. Hence <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> says [De Constit. Monach. i] that the "Divine assistance is to be implored, not lightly, nor with a mind wandering hither and thither: because he that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> thus not only will not obtain what he asks, nay rather will he provoke <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>." Therefore it would seem a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that it should be attentive.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Even <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men sometimes suffer from a wandering of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> when they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa039.htm#verse13">Psalm 39:13</a>, "My heart hath forsaken me."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This question applies chiefly to vocal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Accordingly we must observe that a thing is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in two ways. First, a thing is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> because thereby the end is better obtained: and thus attention is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Secondly, a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> when without it something cannot obtain its effect. Now the effect of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is threefold. The first is an effect which is common to all acts quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and this is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. On order to realize this effect, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should be attentive throughout; because the force of the original <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> with which one sets about <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> renders the whole <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, as is the case with other <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> acts. The second effect of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is proper thereto, and consists in impetration: and again the original <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> looks chiefly, suffices to obtain this effect. But if the original <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is lacking, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> lacks both <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and impetration: because, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [<a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh St. Victor</a>, Expos. in Reg. S. Aug. iii] says, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hears not the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of those who pay no attention to their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>." The third effect of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is that which it produces at once; this is the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> refreshment of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and for this effect attention is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse14">1 Corinthians 14:14</a>): "If I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in a tongue . . . my understanding is without fruit."

<p>It must be observed, however, that there are three kinds of attention that can be brought to vocal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: one which attends to the words, lest we say them wrong, another which attends to the sense of the words, and a third, which attends to the end of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to the thing we are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for. That last kind of attention is most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and even idiots are capable of it. Moreover this attention, whereby the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is fixed on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is sometimes so strong that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> forgets all other things, as <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> states [De Modo Orandi ii].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is to set about <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> through the instigation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, even though afterwards the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> wander through weakness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is unable to remain aloft for long on account of the weakness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness weighs down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the level of inferior things: and hence it is that when, while <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> ascends to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, of a sudden it wanders off through weakness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Purposely to allow one's mind to wander in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and hinders the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> from having fruit. It is against this that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his Rule (Ep. ccxi): "When you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with psalms and hymns, let your mind attend to that which your lips pronounce." But to wander in mind unintentionally does not deprive <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of its fruit. Hence <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> says (De Constit. Monach. i): "If you are so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> weakened by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that you are unable to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> attentively, strive as much as you can to curb yourself, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will pardon you, seeing that you are unable to stand in His presence in a becoming manner, not through negligence but through frailty."

<h2 id="article14">Article 14. Whether prayer should last a long time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should not be continual. It is written (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse7">Matthew 6:7</a>): "When you are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, speak not much." Now one who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> a long time needs to speak much, especially if his be vocal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should not last a long time.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> expresses the desire. Now a desire is all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holier</a> according as it is centered on one thing, according to <a href="../bible/psa026.htm#verse4">Psalm 26:4</a>, "One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after." Therefore the shorter <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is, the more is it acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems to be wrong to transgress the limits fixed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, especially in matters concerning Divine worship, according to <a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse21">Exodus 19:21</a>: "Charge the people, lest they should have a mind to pass the limits to see the Lord, and a very great multitude of them should perish." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has fixed for us the limits of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by instituting the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm">Matthew 6</a>). Therefore it is not right to prolong our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> beyond its limits.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It would seem that we ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> continually. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse1">Luke 18:1</a>): "We ought always to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and not to faint": and it is written (<a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse17">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>): "Pray without ceasing."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may speak about <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in two ways: first, by considering it in itself; secondly, by considering it in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. The not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is the desire of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, from which <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> ought to arise: and this desire ought to be in us continually, either actually or virtually, for the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of this desire remains in whatever we do out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and we ought to "do all things to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse31">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). From this point of view <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> ought to be continual: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad Probam, Ep. cxxx, 9): "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are by themselves a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of continual longing." But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, considered in itself, cannot be continual, because we have to be busy about other works, and, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad Probam. Ep. cxxx, 9), "we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with our lips at certain intervals and seasons, in order to admonish ourselves by means of such like signs, to take note of the amount of our progress in that desire, and to arouse ourselves more eagerly to an increase thereof." Now the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of a thing should be commensurate with its end, for instance the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the dose should be commensurate with health. And so it is becoming that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should last long enough to arouse the fervor of the interior desire: and when it exceeds this measure, so that it cannot be continued any longer without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> weariness, it should be discontinued. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad Probam. Ep. cxxx): "It is said that the brethren in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> make frequent but very short <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, rapid ejaculations, as it were, lest that vigilant and erect attention which is so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> slacken and languish, through the strain being prolonged. By so doing they make it sufficiently clear not only that this attention must not be forced if we are unable to keep it up, but also that if we are able to continue, it should not be broken off too soon." And just as we must judge of this in private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> by considering the attention of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, so too, in public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> we must judge of it by considering the devotion of the people.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad Probam. Ep. cxxx), "to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with many words is not the same as to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> long; to speak long is one thing, to be devout long is another. For it is written that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> passed the whole night in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and that He '<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> the longer' in order to set us an example." Further on he says: "When <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> say little, yet <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> much so long as your attention is fervent. For to say much in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is to discuss your need in too many words: whereas to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> much is to knock at the door of Him we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, by the continuous and devout clamor of the heart. Ondeed this business is frequently done with groans rather than with words, with tears rather than with speech."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Length of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> consists, not in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for many things, but in the affections persisting in the desire of one thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> instituted this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, not that we might use no other words when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, but that in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> we might have none but these things in view, no matter how we express them or think of them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> One may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> continually, either through having a continual desire, as stated above; or through <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> at certain fixed times, though interruptedly; or by reason of the effect, whether in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>--because he remains more devout even after <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, or in some other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>--as when by his kindness a man incites another to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him, even after he himself has ceased <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>.

<h2 id="article15">Article 15. Whether prayer is meritorious?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. All <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since even <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is obtained by means of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> according to <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse13">Luke 11:13</a>, "(How much more) will your Father from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> give the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> Spirit to them that ask Him!" Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> anything, this would seem to be chiefly that which is besought in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Yet it does not always <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> this, because even the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>' <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are frequently not heard; thus <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was not heard when he besought the sting of the flesh to be removed from him. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is based chiefly on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse6">James 1:6</a>, "But let him ask in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nothing wavering." Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not sufficient for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, as instanced in those who have lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the words of <a href="../bible/psa034.htm#verse13">Psalm 34:13</a>, "My <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall be turned into my bosom," explains them as meaning, "if my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> does not profit them, yet shall not I be deprived of my reward." Now reward is not due save to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#13">Article 13</a>) <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, besides <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> consolation at the time of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, has a twofold efficacy in respect of a future effect, namely, efficacy in meriting and efficacy in impetrating. Now <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, like any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act, is efficacious in meriting, because it proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as its root, the proper object of which is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to enjoy. Yet <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> through the medium of religion, of which <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is an act, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), and with the concurrence of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> requisite for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For the offering of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> itself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs to religion, while the desire for the thing. that we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to be accomplished belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to Whom we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; that is, we need to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we can obtain from Him what we seek. Humility is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, because he recognizes his neediness. Devotion too is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>: but this belongs to religion, for it is its first act and a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of all its secondary acts, as stated above (82, 1 and 2).

<p>As to its efficacy in impetrating, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> derives this from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to Whom we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and Who instigates us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom., Serm. cv, 1): "He would not urge us to ask, unless He were willing to give"; and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> <span class="stiki">Cf. Catena Aurea of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> on <a href="../bible/luk018.htm">Luke 18</a>. The words as quoted are not to be found in the words of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a></span> says: "He never refuses to grant our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, since in His loving-kindness He urged us not to faint in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Neither <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> nor any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. And yet even that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which impetrates <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> proceeds from some <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as from a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, since the very act of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> is "a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Persever. xxiii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sometimes the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> regards chiefly something distinct from the object of one's petition. For the chief object of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is beatitude, whereas the direct object of the petition of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> extends sometimes to certain other things, as stated above (A6,7). Accordingly if this other thing that we ask for ourselves be not useful for our beatitude, we do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> it; and sometimes by asking for and desiring such things we lose <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for instance if we ask of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the accomplishment of some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which would be an impious <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. And sometimes it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, nor yet manifestly contrary thereto; and then although he who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, yet he does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to obtain what he asks for. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Liber. Sentent. Prosperi sent. ccxii): "He who faithfully <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the necessaries of this life, is both mercifully heard, and mercifully not heard. For the physician <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> better than the sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the disease." For this reason, too, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was not heard when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the removal of the sting in his flesh, because this was not expedient. If, however, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for something that is useful for our beatitude, through being conducive to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> it not only by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, but also by doing other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>: therefore without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> we receive what we ask for, yet when we ought to receive it: "since certain things are not denied us, but are deferred that they may be granted at a suitable time," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. cii in Joan.): and again this may be hindered if we persevere not in asking for it. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> says (De Constit. Monast. i): "The reason why sometimes thou hast asked and not received, is because thou hast asked amiss, either inconsistently, or lightly, or because thou hast asked for what was not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for thee, or because thou hast ceased asking." Since, however, a man cannot condignly <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> for another, as stated above (I-II, 114, 6), it follows that sometimes one cannot condignly <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for another things that pertain to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. For this reason we are not always heard when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for others, as stated above (07, ad 2,3). Hence it is that four <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are laid down; namely, to ask--"for ourselves--things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>--piously--perseveringly"; when all these four concur, we always obtain what we ask for.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> depends chiefly on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not for its efficacy in meriting, because thus it depends chiefly on <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but for its efficacy in impetrating, because it is through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> comes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> omnipotence and mercy, which are the source whence <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> impetrates what it asks for.

<h2 id="article16">Article 16. Whether sinners impetrate anything from God by their prayers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sinners impetrate nothing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. It is written (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse31">John 9:31</a>): "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth not hear sinners"; and this agrees with the saying of <a href="../bible/pro028.htm#verse9">Proverbs 28:9</a>, "He that turneth away his ears from hearing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall be an abomination." Now an abominable <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> impetrates nothing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore sinners impetrate nothing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the just impetrate from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> what they <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, as stated above (15, ad 2). But sinners cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> anything since they lack <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is the "power of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse5">2 Timothy 3:5</a>, "Having an appearance indeed of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>, but denying the power thereof." and so their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is impious, and yet piety it required in order that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> may be impetrative, as stated above (15, ad 2). Therefore sinners impetrate nothing by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> <span class="stiki">Hom. xiv in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a></span> says: "The Father is unwilling to hear the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which the Son has not inspired." Now in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> inspired by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> we say: "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us": and sinners do not fulfil this. Therefore either they lie in saying this, and so are unworthy to be heard, or, if they do not say it, they are not heard, because they do not observe the form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xliv, super Joan.): "If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were not to hear sinners, the publican would have vainly said: Lord, be merciful to me a sinner"; and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xviii of the same Opus Imperfectum] says: "Everyone that asketh shall receive, that is to say whether he be righteous or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the sinner, two things are to be considered: his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which He <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>. Accordingly when a sinner <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for something as sinner, i.e. in accordance with a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> desire, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hears him not through mercy but sometimes through vengeance when He allows the sinner to fall yet deeper into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> refuses in mercy what He grants in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (Tract. lxxiii in Joan.). On the other hand <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hears the sinner's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> if it proceed from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire, not out of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, because the sinner does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to be heard, but out of pure mercy [Cf. 15, ad 1], provided however he fulfil the four <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> given above, namely, that he beseech for himself things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, piously and perseveringly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Tract. xliv super Joan.), these words were spoken by the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before being anointed, i.e. perfectly enlightened, and consequently lack authority. And yet there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the saying if it refers to a sinner as such, in which sense also the sinner's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is said to be an abomination.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There can be no godliness in the sinner's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> as though his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> were quickened by a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and yet his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> may be godly in so far as he asks for something pertaining to godliness. Even so a man who has not the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is able to will something <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, as stated above (Question 59, Article 2). And though his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, it can be impetrative, because <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> depends on <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereas impetration rests on <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (07, ad 1) the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> is pronounced in the common <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: and so if anyone say the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> while unwilling to forgive his neighbor's trespasses, he lies not, although his words do not apply to him personally: for they are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as referred to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, from which he is excluded by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, and consequently he is deprived of the fruit of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Sometimes, however, a sinner is prepared to forgive those who have trespassed against him, wherefore his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are heard, according to <a href="../bible/sir028.htm#verse2">Sirach 28:2</a>, "Forgive thy neighbor if he hath hurt thee, and then shall thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be forgiven to thee when thou prayest."

<h2 id="article17">Article 17. Whether the parts of prayer are fittingly described as supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the parts of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> are unfittingly described as supplications, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, intercessions, and thanksgivings. Supplication would seem to be a kind of adjuration. Yet, according to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Super Matth. Tract. xxxv), "a man who wishes to live according to the gospel need not adjure another, for if it be unlawful to swear, it is also unlawful to adjure." Therefore supplication is unfittingly reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iii, 24), "to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> is to ask becoming things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore it is unfitting to distinguish "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>" from "intercessions."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, thanksgivings regard the past, while the others regard the future. But the past precedes the future. Therefore thanksgivings are unfittingly placed after the others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> suffices the authority of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 2:1</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Three <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are requisite for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. First, that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> should approach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whom he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>: this is signified in the word "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>," because <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is "the raising up of one's mind to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." The second is that there should be a petition, and this is signified in the word "intercession." On this case sometimes one asks for something definite, and then some say it is "intercession" properly so called, or we may ask for some thing indefinitely, for instance to be helped by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or we may simply indicate a fact, as in <a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse3">John 11:3</a>, "Behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick," and then they call it "insinuation." The third <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is the reason for impetrating what we ask for: and this either on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who asks. The reason of impetration on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His sanctity, on account of which we ask to be heard, according to <a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse17">Daniel 9:17-18</a>, "For Thy own sake, incline, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Thy ear"; and to this pertains "supplication" [obsecratio] which means a pleading through sacred things, as when we say, "Through Thy nativity, deliver us, O Lord." The reason for impetration on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who asks is "thanksgiving"; since "through giving thanks for benefits received we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to receive yet greater benefits," as we say in the collect [Ember Friday in September and Postcommunion of the common of a Confessor Bishop]. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 2:1</a> says that "in the Mass, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is preceded by supplication," in which certain sacred things are called to mind; that "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> itself," in which especially the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> should be raised up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and that "intercessions are in the petitions that follow, and thanksgivings at the end."

<p>We may notice these four things in several of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> collects. Thus in the collect of <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> Sunday the words, "Almighty <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" belong to the offering up of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the words, "Who hast given to Thy servants," etc. belong to thanksgiving; the words, "grant, we beseech Thee," belong to intercession; and the words at the end, "Through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>," etc. belong to supplication.

<p>In the "Conferences of the Fathers" (ix, cap. 11, seqq.) we read: "Supplication is bewailing one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is vowing something to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; intercession is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for others; thanksgiving is offered by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in ineffable <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>." The first explanation, however, is the better.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "Supplication" is an adjuration not for the purpose of compelling, for this is forbidden, but in order to implore mercy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a>" in the general sense includes all the things mentioned here; but when distinguished from the others it denotes properly the ascent to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Among things that are diverse the past precedes the future; but the one and same thing is future before it is past. Hence thanksgiving for other benefits precedes intercession: but one and the same benefit is first sought, and finally, when it has been received, we give thanks for it. Intercession is preceded by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> whereby we approach Him of Whom we ask: and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is preceded by supplication, whereby through the consideration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> we dare approach Him.
