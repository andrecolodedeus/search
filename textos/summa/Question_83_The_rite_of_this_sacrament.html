<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ is sacrificed in this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not sacrificed in the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse14">Hebrews 10:14</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by one oblation hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified." But that oblation was His oblation. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not sacrificed in the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Christ's sacrifice was made upon the cross, whereon "He delivered Himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for an odor of sweetness," as is said in <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians 5:2</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not crucified in the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. Therefore, neither is He sacrificed.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv), in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sacrifice the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and the victim are one and the same. But in the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and the victim are not the same. Therefore, the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not a sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the Liber Sentent. Prosp. (cf. Ep. xcviii): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was sacrificed once in Himself, and yet He is sacrificed daily in the Sacrament."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is called a sacrifice for two reasons. First, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ad Simplician. ii), "the images of things are called by the names of the things whereof they are the images; as when we look upon a picture or a fresco, we say, 'This is Cicero and that is Sallust.'" But, as was said above (Question 79, Article 1), the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is an image representing <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, which is His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice. Accordingly the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is called <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sacrifice. Hence it is that <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, in commenting on <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse1">Hebrews 10:1</a>, says: "In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was offered up a sacrifice capable of giving <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; what then do we do? Do we not offer it up every day in memory of His death?" Secondly it is called a sacrifice, in respect of the effect of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: because, to wit, by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, we are made partakers of the fruit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Hence in one of the Sunday <a href="../cathen/13673b.htm">Secrets</a> (Ninth Sunday after <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Pentecost</a>) we say: "Whenever the commemoration of this sacrifice is celebrated, the work of our redemption is enacted." Consequently, according to the first reason, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was sacrificed, even in the figures of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>: hence it is stated in the Apocalypse (13:8): "Whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>, which was slain from the beginning of the world." But according to the second reason, it is proper to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be sacrificed in its celebration.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (<a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse1">Hebrews 10:1</a>), "there is but one victim," namely that which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> offered, and which we offer, "and not many victims, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was offered but once: and this latter sacrifice is the pattern of the former. For, just as what is offered everywhere is one body, and not many bodies, so also is it but one sacrifice."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is an image representing <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, so the altar is representative of the cross itself, upon which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was sacrificed in His proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> For the same reason (cf. Reply to Obj. 2) the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> also bears <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> image, in Whose <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and by Whose power he pronounces the words of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, as is evident from what was said above (82, 1,3). And so, in a measure, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and victim are one and the same.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the time for celebrating this mystery has been properly determined?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the time for celebrating this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> has not been properly determined. For as was observed above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is representative of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/04155a.htm">commemoration</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> takes place in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> once in the year: because <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enarr. ii in Ps. 21): "Is not Christ slain as often as the Pasch is celebrated? Nevertheless, the anniversary remembrance represents what took place in by-gone days; and so it does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us to be stirred as if we saw <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> hanging upon the cross." Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought to be celebrated but once a year.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is commemorated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the Friday before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and not on Christmas Day. Consequently, since this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is commemorative of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, it seems unsuitable for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to be celebrated thrice on Christmas Day, and to be entirely omitted on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to imitate <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> institution. But it was in the evening that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> this sacrament. Therefore it seems that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought to be celebrated at that time of day.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as is set down in the Decretals (De Consecr., dist. i), Pope Leo I wrote to Dioscorus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Alexandria, that "it is permissible to celebrate mass in the first part of the day." But the day begins at midnight, as was said above (80, 8, ad 5). Therefore it seems that after midnight it is lawful to celebrate.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, in one of the Sunday <a href="../cathen/13673b.htm">Secrets</a> (Ninth Sunday after <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Pentecost</a>) we say: "Grant us, Lord, we beseech Thee, to frequent these mysteries." But there will be greater frequency if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> celebrates several times a day. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> ought not to be hindered from celebrating several times daily.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> is the custom which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> observes according to the statutes of the Canons.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), in the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, we must take into consideration the representation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, and the participation of its fruits; and the time suitable for the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> ought to be determined by each of these considerations. Now since, owing to our daily defects, we stand in daily need of the fruits of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is offered regularly every day in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> teaches us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> (<a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse3">Luke 11:3</a>): "Give us this day our daily bread": in explanation of which words <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom. xxviii): "If it be a daily bread, why do you take it once a year, as the Greeks have the custom in the east? Receive it daily that it may benefit you every day."

<p>But since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was celebrated from the third to the ninth hour, therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is solemnly celebrated by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in that part of the day.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is recalled in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, inasmuch as its effect flows out to the faithful; but at Passion-tide <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is recalled inasmuch as it was wrought in Him Who is our Head. This took place but once; whereas the faithful receive daily the fruits of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: consequently, the former is commemorated but once in the year, whereas the latter takes place every day, both that we may partake of its fruit and in order that we may have a perpetual memorial.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The figure ceases on the advent of the reality. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a figure and a representation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, as stated above. And therefore on the day on which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is recalled as it was really accomplished, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not consecrated. Nevertheless, lest the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be deprived on that day of the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> offered to us by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, the body of Christ <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the day before is reserved to be consumed on that day; but the blood is not reserved, on account of danger, and because the blood is more specially the image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, as stated above (78, 3, ad 2). Nor is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as some affirm, that the wine is changed into blood when the particle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is dropped into it. Because this cannot be done otherwise than by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> under the due form of words.

<p>On Christmas Day, however, several masses are said on account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> threefold nativity. Of these the first is His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> birth, which is hidden in our regard. and therefore one mass is sung in the night, in the "Introit" of which we say: "The Lord said unto Me: Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee." The second is His nativity in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> birth, whereby Christ rises "as the day-star in our [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'your'] hearts" (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse19">2 Peter 1:19</a>), and on this account the mass is sung at dawn, and in the "Introit" we say: "The light will shine on us today." The third is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> temporal and bodily birth, according as He went forth from the virginal womb, becoming visible to us through being clothed with flesh: and on that account the third mass is sung in broad daylight, in the "Introit" of which we say: "A child is born to us." Nevertheless, on the other hand, it can be said that His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> generation, of itself, is in the full light, and on this account in the gospel of the third mass mention is made of His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> birth. But regarding His birth in the body, He was literally born during the night, as a sign that He came to the darknesses of our infirmity; hence also in the midnight mass we say the gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> nativity in the flesh.

<p>Likewise on other days upon which many of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> benefits have to be recalled or besought, several masses are celebrated on one day, as for instance, one for the feast, and another for a fast or for the dead.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As already observed (73, 5), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to give this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> last of all, in order that it might make a deeper impression on the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; and therefore it was after supper, at the close of day, that He <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> this sacrament and gave it to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. But we celebrate at the hour when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> suffered, i.e. either, as on <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast-days</a>, at the hour of <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, when He was crucified by the tongues of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> (<a href="../bible/mar015.htm#verse25">Mark 15:25</a>), and when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended upon the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse15">Acts 2:15</a>); or, as when no feast is kept, at the hour of Sext, when He was crucified at the hands of the soldiers (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse14">John 19:14</a>), or, as on <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> days, at None, when crying out with a loud voice He gave up the ghost (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse46">Matthew 27:46-50</a>).

<p>Nevertheless the mass can be postponed, especially when <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> have to be conferred, and still more on Holy Saturday; both on account of the length of the office, and also because orders belong to the Sunday, as is set forth in the Decretals (dist. 75).

<p>Masses, however, can be celebrated "in the first part of the day," owing to any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; as is stated De Consecr., dist. 1.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As a rule mass ought to be said in the day and not in the night, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is present in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, Who says (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse4">John 9:4-5</a>): "I must work the works of Him that sent Me, whilst it is day: because the night cometh when no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can work; as long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world." Yet this should be done in such a manner that the beginning of the day is not to be taken from midnight; nor from sunrise, that is, when the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the sun appears above the earth; but when the dawn begins to show: because then the sun is said to be risen when the brightness of his beams appears. Accordingly it is written (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse1">Mark 16:1</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> came to the tomb, the sun being now risen"; though, as John relates (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse1">John 20:1</a>), "while it was yet dark they came to the tomb." It is in this way that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> explains this difference (De Consens. Evang. iii).

<p>Exception is made on the night of Christmas eve, when mass is celebrated, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> was born in the night (De Consecr., dist. 1). And in like manner it is celebrated on Holy Saturday towards the beginning of the night, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> rose in the night, that is, "when it was yet dark, before the sun's rising was manifest."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As is set down in the decree (De Consecr., dist. 1), in virtue of a decree of <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Pope Alexander II</a>, "it is enough for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to celebrate one mass each day, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered once and redeemed the whole world; and very <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> is he who can worthily celebrate one mass. But there are some who say one mass for the dead, and another of the day, if need be. But I do not deem that those escape condemnation who presume to celebrate several masses daily, either for the sake of money, or to gain flattery from the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>." And <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> says (Extra, De Celebr. Miss., chap. Consuluisti) that "except on the day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> birth, unless <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> urges, it suffices for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to celebrate only one mass each day."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether this sacrament ought to be celebrated in a house and with sacred vessels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought not to be celebrated in a house and with sacred vessels. For this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a representation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> Passion. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not suffer in a house, but outside the city gate, according to <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse12">Hebrews 1:12</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that He might sanctify the people by His own blood, suffered without the gate." Therefore, it seems that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought not to be celebrated in a house, but rather in the open air.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to imitate the custom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. But the house wherein <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> first wrought this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, but merely an ordinary supper-room prepared by the master of the house, as related in <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse11">Luke 22:11-12</a>. Moreover, we read (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse46">Acts 2:46</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were continuing daily with one accord in the temple; and, breaking bread from house to house, they took their meat with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">gladness</a>." Consequently, there is no need for houses, in which this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is celebrated, to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing that is to no purpose ought to be done in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is governed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But it seems useless to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a church, or an altar, or such like inanimate things, since they are not capable of receiving <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it is unbecoming for such consecrations to be performed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, only Divine works ought to be recalled with <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa091.htm#verse5">Psalm 91:5</a>: "I shall rejoice in the works of Thy hands." Now the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church or altar, is the work of a man; as is also the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, and of the ministers, and of other such things. But these latter consecrations are not commemorated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore neither ought the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church or of an altar to be commemorated with <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ought to correspond with the figure. But in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which was a figure of the New, the altar was not made of hewn stones: for, it is written (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse24">Exodus 20:24</a>): "You shall make an altar of earth unto Me . . . and if thou make an altar of stone unto Me, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones." Again, the altar is commanded to be made of "setim-wood," covered "with brass" (<a href="../bible/exo027.htm#verse1">Exodus 27:1-2</a>), or "with gold" (<a href="../bible/exo025.htm">Exodus 25</a>). Consequently, it seems unfitting for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to make exclusive use of altars made of stone.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> with the paten represents <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> tomb, which was "hewn in a rock," as is narrated in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> ought to be of stone, and not of gold or of silver or tin.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, just as gold is the most precious among the materials of the altar vessels, so are cloths of silk the most precious among other cloths. Consequently, since the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is of gold, the altar cloths ought to be made of silk and not of linen.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, the dispensing and ordering of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ministers, just as the ordering of temporal affairs is subject to the ruling of secular princes; hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>): "Let a man so esteem us as the ministers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> end the dispensers of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But if anything be done against the ordinances of princes it is deemed void. Therefore, if the various items mentioned above are suitably commanded by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, it seems that the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> unless they be observed; and so it appears to follow that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words are not sufficient of themselves for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> this sacrament: which is contrary to the fact. Consequently, it does not seem fitting for such ordinances to be made touching the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Church's ordinances are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own ordinances; since He said (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse20">Matthew 18:20</a>): "Wherever two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two things to be considered regarding the equipment of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: one of these belongs to the representation of the events connected with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>; while the other is connected with the reverence due to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is contained verily, and not in figure only.

<p>Hence we <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> those things which we make use of in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; both that we may show our reverence for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and in order to represent the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> which is the effect of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse12">Hebrews 13:12</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that He might sanctify the people by His own blood," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This sacrament ought as a rule to be celebrated in a house, whereby the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is signified, according to <a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse15">1 Timothy 3:15</a>: "That thou mayest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Because "outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there is no place for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Liber Sentent. Prosp. xv). And because the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was not to be confined within the territories of the Jewish people, but was to be established throughout the whole world, therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was not celebrated within the city of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, but in the open country, that so the whole world might serve as a house for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Passion. Nevertheless, as is said in De Consecr., dist. 1, "if a church be not to hand, we permit travelers to celebrate mass in the open air, or in a tent, if there be a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> altar-table to hand, and the other requisites belonging to the sacred function."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The house in which this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is celebrated denotes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and is termed a church; and so it is fittingly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, both to represent the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> acquired from the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, as well as to denote the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> required of them who have to receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. By the altar Christ Himself is signified, of Whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse15">Hebrews 13:15</a>): "Through Him we offer a sacrifice of praise to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Hence the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the altar signifies Christ's <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, of which it was said (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke 1:35</a>): "The Holy one born of thee shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." Hence we read in De Consecr., dist. 1: "It has seemed pleasing for the altars to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> not merely with the anointing of <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, but likewise with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>."

<p>And therefore, as a rule, it is not lawful to celebrate this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> except in a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> house. Hence it is enacted (De Consecr., dist. 1): "Let no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> presume to say mass except in places <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>." And furthermore because <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and other unbelievers are not members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, therefore we read (De Consecr., dist. 1): "It is not lawful to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> a church in which the bodies of unbelievers are buried, but if it seem suitable for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, then, after removing the corpses and tearing down the walls or beams, let it be rebuilt. If, however, it has been already <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and the faithful lie in it, it is lawful to celebrate mass therein." Nevertheless in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can be performed in houses which have not been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, or which have been profaned; but with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> consent. Hence we read in the same distinction: "We deem that masses are not to be celebrated everywhere, but in places <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or where he gives permission." But not without a portable altar <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>: hence in the same distinction we read: "We permit that, if the churches be devastated or burned, masses may be celebrated in chapels, with a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> altar." For because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is the fount of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, therefore in <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> altar suffices for performing this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And on this account a church is never <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the altar. Yet sometimes an altar is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> apart from the church, with the relics of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, "whose lives are hidden with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse3">Colossians 3:3</a>). Accordingly under the same distinction we read: "It is our pleasure that altars, in which no relics of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are found enclosed, be thrown down, if possible, by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> presiding over such places."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The church, altar, and other like inanimate things are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, not because they are capable of receiving <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but because they acquire special <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, whereby they are rendered fit for the Divine worship, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> derives devotion therefrom, making him more fitted for Divine functions, unless this be hindered by want of reverence. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/2ma003.htm#verse38">2 Maccabees 3:38</a>): "There is undoubtedly in that place a certain power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for He that hath His dwelling in the heavens is the visitor, and the protector of that place."

<p>Hence it is that such places are cleansed and exorcised before being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, that the enemy's power may be driven forth. And for the same reason churches defiled by shedding of blood or seed are reconciled: because some machination of the enemy is apparent on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed there. And for this reason we read in the same distinction: "Wherever you find churches of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> them as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches without delay by means of devout <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and rites." Hence, too, it is that some say with probability, that by entering a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> church one obtains forgiveness of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, just as one does by the sprinkling of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> water; alleging the words of <a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse2">Psalm 84:2-3</a>: "Lord, Thou hast blessed Thy land . . . Thou hast forgiven the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of Thy people." And therefore, in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> acquired by a church's <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is never repeated. Accordingly we find in the same distinction the following words quoted from the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>: "Churches which have once been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, must not be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> again, except they be devastated by fire, or defiled by shedding of blood or of anyone's seed; because, just as a child once <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, ought not to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, so neither ought a place, once dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> again, except owing to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> mentioned above; provided that the consecrators held <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Holy <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>": in fact, those outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>. But, as we read in the same distinction: "Churches or altars of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> are to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> anew."

<p>And since they acquire special <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, we find it laid down in the same distinction that "the beams of a dedicated church ought not to be used for any other purpose, except it be for some other church, or else they are to be burned, or put to the use of brethren in some monastery: but on no account are they to be discarded for works of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>." We read there, too, that "the altar covering, chair, <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlesticks</a>, and veil, are to be burned when warn out; and their ashes are to be placed in the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a>, or in the walls, or else cast into the trenches beneath the flag-stones, so as not to be defiled by the feet of those that enter."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the altar signifies Christ's <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a house the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the entire Church, therefore the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church or of an altar is more fittingly commemorated. And on this account the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of a church dedication is observed for eight days, in order to signify the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">happy resurrection of Christ</a> and <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">of the Church's members</a>. Nor is the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church or altar <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> doing only, since it has a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence in the same distinction (De Consecr.) it is said: "The solemnities of the dedication of churches are to be solemnly celebrated each year: and that dedications are to be kept up for eight days, you will find in the third book of Kings" (<a href="../bible/1ki008.htm#verse66">8:66</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As we read in De Consecr., dist. 1, "altars, if not of stone, are not to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with the anointing of <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>." And this is in keeping with the signification of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; both because the altar signifies Christ, for in <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 10:3</a>, it is written, "But the rock was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>": and because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was laid in a stone sepulchre. This is also in keeping with the use of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Because stone is solid, and may be found everywhere. which was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the old Law, when the altar was made in one place. As to the commandment to make the altar of earth, or of unhewn stones, this was given in order to remove <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> As is laid down in the same distinction, "formerly the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> did not use golden but wooden chalices; but Pope Zephyrinus ordered the mass to be said with glass patens; and subsequently Pope Urban had everything made of silver." Afterwards it was decided that "the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> with the paten should be made entirely of gold, or of silver or at least of tin. But it is not to be made of brass, or copper, because the action of the wine thereon produces verdigris, and provokes vomiting. But no one is to presume to sing mass with a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of wood or of glass," because as the wood is porous, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> blood would remain in it; while glass is brittle and there might arise danger of breakage; and the same applies to stone. Consequently, out of reverence for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it was enacted that the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> should be made of the aforesaid materials.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> Where it could be done without danger, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gave order for that thing to be used which more expressively represents <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. But there was not so much danger regarding the body which is placed on the corporal, as there is with the blood contained in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. And consequently, although the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is not made of stone, yet the corporal is made of linen, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was wrapped therein. Hence we read in an Epistle of Pope Silvester, quoted in the same distinction: "By a unanimous decree we command that no one shall presume to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the altar</a> upon a cloth of silk, or dyed material, but upon linen <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was buried in a clean linen winding-sheet." Moreover, linen material is becoming, owing to its cleanness, to denote purity of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and, owing to the manifold labor with which it is prepared, to denote <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> The dispensing of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ministers; but their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ministers can make no ordinances regarding the form of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and the manner of celebrating. And therefore, if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> pronounces the words of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> over the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a>, then, without every one of the things mentioned above--namely, without house, and altar, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and corporal, and the other things instituted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>--he consecrates Christ's body in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; yet he is guilty of grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in not following the rite of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the words spoken in this sacrament are properly framed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the words spoken in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> are not properly framed. For, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. iv), this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own words. Therefore no other words besides <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> should be spoken in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us through the Gospel. But in <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> this sacrament words are used which are not set down in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>: for we do not read in the Gospel, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> lifting up His eyes to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> while <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> this sacrament: and similarly it is said in the Gospel: "Take ye and eat" [comedite] without the addition of the word "all," whereas in celebrating this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> we say: "Lifting up His eyes to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," and again, "Take ye and eat [manducate] of this." Therefore such words as these are out of place when spoken in the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are ordained for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all the faithful. But in the celebration of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> there is no common <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> put up for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all the faithful and of the departed. Consequently it is unbecoming in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> especially is called the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which belong to instruction in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ought rather to be given regarding <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> than regarding this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, such as the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, devotion on the part of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> is required in every sacrament. Consequently, the devotion of the faithful ought not to be stirred up in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> more than in the others by Divine praises and by admonitions, such as, "Lift up your hearts."

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the minister of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as stated above (Question 82, Article 1). Consequently, all the words spoken in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought to be uttered by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and not some by the ministers, and some by the choir.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, the Divine power works this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> unfailingly. Therefore it is to no purpose that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> asks for the perfecting of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, saying: "Which oblation do thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in all," etc.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the New Law</a> is much more excellent than the sacrifice of the fathers of old. Therefore, it is unfitting for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that this sacrifice may be as acceptable as the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/01035c.htm">Abel</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body does not begin to be in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by change of place, as stated above (Question 75, Article 2), so likewise neither does it cease to be there. Consequently, it is improper for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to ask: "Bid these things be borne by the hands of thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> unto Thine altar on high."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We find it stated in De Consecr., dist. 1, that "<a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a> according to the flesh, and <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Caesarea, edited the rite of celebrating the mass": and from their authority it is manifest that whatever words are employed in this matter, are chosen becomingly.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the whole <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is comprised in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, therefore is it performed with greater <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> than the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. And since it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc004.htm#verse17">Ecclesiastes 4:17</a>): "Keep thy foot when thou goest into the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; and (<a href="../bible/sir018.htm#verse23">Sirach 18:23</a>): "Before <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> prepare thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," therefore the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is preceded by a certain preparation in order that we may perform worthily that which follows after. The first part of this preparation is Divine praise, and consists in the "Introit": according to <a href="../bible/psa049.htm#verse23">Psalm 49:23</a>: "The sacrifice of praise shall glorify me; and there is the way by which I will show him the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": and this is taken for the most part from the Psalms, or, at least, is sung with a Psalm, because, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii): "The Psalms comprise by way of praise whatever is contained in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a>."

<p>The second part contains a reference to our present misery, by reason of which we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for mercy, saying: "Lord, have mercy on us," thrice for the Person of the Father, and "Christ, have mercy on us," thrice for the Person of the Son, and "Lord, have mercy on us," thrice for the Person of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; against the threefold misery of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and punishment; or else to express the "circuminsession" of all the Divine Persons.

<p>The third part commemorates the heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to the possession of which, after this life of misery, we are tending, in the words, "Glory be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on high," which are sung on festival days, on which the heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is commemorated, but are omitted in those sorrowful offices which commemorate our unhappy state.

<p>The fourth part contains the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> makes for the people, that they may be made worthy of such great mysteries.

<p>There precedes, in the second place, the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, because this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is "a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," as stated above (78, 3, ad 5). Now this instruction is given "dispositively," when the Lectors and Sub-deacons read aloud in the church the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: after this "lesson," the choir sing the "Gradual," which signifies progress in life; then the "Alleluia" is intoned, and this denotes <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; or in mournful offices the "Tract", expressive of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sighing; for all these things ought to result from the aforesaid teaching. But the people are instructed "perfectly" by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching contained in the Gospel, which is read by the higher ministers, that is, by the Deacons. And because we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse46">John 8:46</a>, "If I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, why do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me?" after the Gospel has been read, the "Creed" is sung in which the people show that they assent by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> doctrine. And it is sung on those festivals of which mention is made therein, as on the festivals of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who laid the foundations of this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and on other such days.

<p>So then, after the people have been prepared and instructed, the next step is to proceed to the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, which is both offered as a sacrifice, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and received as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: since first we have the oblation; then the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> offered; and thirdly, its reception.

<p>In regard to the oblation, two things are done, namely, the people's praise in singing the "offertory," expressing the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the offerers, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> asking for the people's oblation to be made acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence David said (<a href="../bible/1ch029.htm#verse17">1 Chronicles 29:17</a>): "In the simplicity of my heart, I have . . . offered all these things: and I have seen with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> Thy people which are here present, offer Thee their offerings": and then he makes the following <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: "O Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . keep . . . this will."

<p>Then, regarding the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, performed by <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> power, the people are first of all excited to devotion in the "Preface," hence they are admonished "to lift up their hearts to the Lord," and therefore when the "Preface" is ended the people devoutly praise <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead, saying with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: <a href="../cathen/13432a.htm">"Holy, Holy, Holy"</a>; and His humanity, saying with the children: "Blessed is he that cometh." In the next place the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> makes a "commemoration," first of those for whom this sacrifice is offered, namely, for the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and "for those set in high places" (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse2">1 Timothy 2:2</a>), and, in a special manner, of them "who offer, or for whom the mass is offered." Secondly, he commemorates the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, invoking their patronage for those mentioned above, when he says: "Communicating with, and honoring the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>," etc. Thirdly, he concludes the petition when he says: "Wherefore that this oblation," etc., in order that the oblation may be salutary to them for whom it is offered.

<p>Then he comes to the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> itself. Here he asks first of all for the effect of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, when he says: "Which oblation do Thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," etc. Secondly, he performs the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> using our Saviour's words, when he says: "Who the day before," etc. Thirdly, he makes excuse for his presumption in obeying Christ's command, saying: "Wherefore, calling to mind," etc. Fourthly, he asks that the sacrifice accomplished may find favor with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he says: "Look down upon them with a propitious," etc. Fifthly, he begs for the effect of this sacrifice and sacrament, first for the partakers, saying: "We humbly beseech Thee"; then for the dead, who can no longer receive it, saying: "Be mindful also, O Lord," etc.; thirdly, for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> themselves who offer, saying: "And to us sinners," etc.

<p>Then follows the act of receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. First of all, the people are prepared for Communion; first, by the common <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the congregation, which is the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, in which we ask for our daily bread to be given us; and also by private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> puts up specially for the people, when he says: "Deliver us, we beseech Thee, O Lord," etc. Secondly, the people are prepared by the "Pax" which is given with the words, "Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," etc., because this is the sacrament of unity and peace, as stated above (73, 4; 79, 1). But in masses for the dead, in which the sacrifice is offered not for present peace, but for the repose of the dead, the "Pax" is omitted.

<p>Then follows the reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> receiving first, and afterwards giving it to others, because, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii), he who gives Divine things to others, ought first to partake thereof himself.

<p>Finally, the whole celebration of mass ends with the thanksgiving, the people rejoicing for having received the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> (and this is the meaning of the singing after the Communion); and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> returning thanks by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, at the close of the supper with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, "said a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse30">Matthew 26:30</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is accomplished by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words only; but the other words must be added to dispose the people for receiving it, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As is stated in the <a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse25">last chapter of John (verse 25)</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said and did many things which are not written down by the Evangelists; and among them is the uplifting of His eyes to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> at the supper; nevertheless the Roman Church had it by tradition from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For it seems reasonable that He Who lifted up His eyes to the Father in raising <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> to life, as related in <a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse41">John 11:41</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which He made for the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse1">John 17:1</a>), had more reason to do so in instituting this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as being of greater import.

<p>The use of the word "manducate" instead of "comedite" makes no difference in the meaning, nor does the expression signify, especially since those words are no part of the form, as stated above (78, 1, ad 2,4).

<p>The additional word "all" is understood in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, although not expressed, because He had said (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse54">John 6:54</a>): "Except you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> . . . you shall not have life in you."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is the sacrament of the unity of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: and therefore in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, more than in the others, mention ought to be made of all that belongs to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the entire Church.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> There is a twofold instruction in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>: the first is for those receiving it for the first time, that is to say, for catechumens, and such instruction is given in connection with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. The other is the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who take part in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; and such instruction is given in connection with this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Nevertheless catechumens and unbelievers are not excluded therefrom. Hence in De Consecr., dist. 1, it is laid down: "Let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> hinder no one from entering the church, and hearing the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be they <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, until the mass of the Catechumens begins," in which the instruction regarding the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is contained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Greater devotion is required in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> than in the others, for the reason that the entire <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is contained therein. Moreover, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> requires a more general devotion, i.e. on the part of the whole people, since for them it is offered; and not merely on the part of the recipients, as in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> observes (De Orat. Domin. 31), "The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in saying the Preface, disposes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the brethren by saying, 'Lift up your hearts,' and when the people answer--'We have lifted them up to the Lord,' let them remember that they are to think of nothing else but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> As was said above (ad 3), those things are mentioned in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> which belong to the entire Church; and consequently some things which refer to the people are sung by the choir, and same of these words are all sung by the choir, as though inspiring the entire people with them; and there are other words which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> begins and the people take up, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> then acting as in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to show that the things they denote have come to the people through Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> intones the "Creed" and the "Gloria in excelsis Deo." Other words are uttered by the ministers, such as the doctrine of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, as a sign that this doctrine was announced to the peoples through ministers sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And there are other words which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone recites, namely, such as belong to his personal office, "that he may offer up <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the people" (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse1">Hebrews 5:1</a>). Some of these, however, he says aloud, namely, such as are common to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and people alike, such as the "common <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>"; other words, however, belong to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone, such as the oblation and the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; consequently, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that are said in connection with these have to be said by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in secret. Nevertheless, in both he calls the people to attention by saying: "The Lord be with you," and he waits for them to assent by saying "<a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." And therefore before the secret <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> he says aloud, "The Lord be with you," and he concludes, "For ever and ever." Or the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> secretly pronounces some of the words as a token that regarding <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> acknowledged Him only in secret.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The efficacy of the sacramental words can be hindered by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Nor is there anything unbecoming in our asking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> He will do, just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse1">John 17:1-5</a>) asked for His glorification.

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not seem to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> there for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> to be fulfilled, but that it may be fruitful in our regard, hence he says expressively: "That it may become 'to us' the body and the blood." Again, the words preceding these have that meaning, when he says: "Vouchsafe to make this oblation blessed," i.e. according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Paschasius, De Corp. et Sang. Dom. xii), "that we may receive a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>," namely, through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; "'enrolled,' i.e. that we may be enrolled in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; 'ratified,' i.e. that we may be incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; 'reasonable,' i.e. that we may be stripped of our animal sense; 'acceptable,' i.e. that we who in ourselves are displeasing, may, by its means, be made acceptable to His only Son."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> Although this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is of itself preferable to all ancient <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, yet the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the men of old were most acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on account of their devotion. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> asks that this sacrifice may be accepted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the devotion of the offerers, just as the former <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were accepted by Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that the sacramental <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> may be borne up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; nor that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body may be borne thither, for it does not cease to be there; but he offers this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Christ's mystical body</a>, which is signified in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> standing by at the Divine mysteries may present to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and people, according to <a href="../bible/rev008.htm#verse4">Apocalypse 8:4</a>: "And the smoke of the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> ascended up before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> "altar on high" means either the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> triumphant, unto which we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to be translated, or else <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, in Whom we ask to share; because it is said of this altar (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse26">Exodus 20:26</a>): "Thou shalt not go up by steps unto My altar, i.e. thou shalt make no steps towards the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>." Or else by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> we are to understand <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, Who is the "Angel of great counsel" (<a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse6">Isaiah 9:6</a>: <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>), Who unites His <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> triumphant.

<p>And from this the mass derives its name [missa; because the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> sends [mittit] his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, as the people do through the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. or else because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the victim sent [missa] to us: accordingly the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> on festival days "dismisses" the people at the end of the mass, by saying: "Ite, missa est," that is, the victim has been sent [missa est] to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, so that it may be accepted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the actions performed in celebrating this sacrament are becoming?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the actions performed in celebrating this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> are not becoming. For, as is evident from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. But under the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the ceremonies of the old are not to be observed, such as that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and ministers were purified with water when they drew nigh to offer up the sacrifice: for we read (<a href="../bible/exo030.htm#verse19">Exodus 30:19-20</a>): "Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and feet . . . when they are going into the tabernacle of the testimony . . . and when they are to come to the altar." Therefore it is not fitting that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should wash his hands when celebrating mass.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, (<a href="../bible/exo030.htm#verse7">Exodus 30:7</a>), the Lord commanded <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> to "burn sweet-smelling <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>" upon the altar which was "before the propitiatory": and the same action was part of the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Therefore it is not fitting for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to use <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> during mass.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the ceremonies performed in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought not to be repeated. Consequently it is not proper for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to repeat the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> many times over this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse7">Hebrews 7:7</a>): "And without all contradiction, that which is less, is blessed by the better." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, is much greater than the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Therefore quite unseemingly the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, blesses this sacrament, by signing it with the cross.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, nothing which appears ridiculous ought to be done in one of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But it seems ridiculous to perform gestures, e.g. for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to stretch out his arms at times, to join his hands, to join together his fingers, and to bow down. Consequently, such things ought not to be done in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, it seems ridiculous for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to turn round frequently towards the people, and often to greet the people. Consequently, such things ought not to be done in the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>) deems it improper for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be divided. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Therefore it is not proper for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to divide the host.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, the ceremonies performed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> represent <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. But during the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> Christ's body was divided in the places of the five wounds. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body ought to be broken into five parts rather than into three.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> entire body is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> apart from the blood. Consequently, it is not proper for a particle of the body to be mixed with the blood.

<p><strong>Objection 10.</strong> Further, just as, in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is set before us as food, so is His blood, as drink. But in receiving <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body no other bodily food is added in the celebration of the mass. Therefore, it is out of place for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, after taking <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood, to receive other wine which is not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 11.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ought to be conformable with the figure. But regarding the Paschal Lamb, which was a figure of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it was commanded that nothing of it should "remain until the morning." It is improper therefore for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> hosts to be reserved, and not consumed at once.

<p><strong>Objection 12.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> addresses in the plural number those who are hearing mass, when he says, "The Lord be with you": and, "Let us return thanks." But it is out of keeping to address one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> in the plural number, especially an inferior. Consequently it seems unfitting for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to say mass with only a single server present. Therefore in the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> it seems that some of the things done are out of place.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> stands for these things: and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, since she is taught by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (Question 60, Article 6), there is a twofold manner of signification in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, by words, and by actions, in order that the signification may thus be more perfect. Now, in the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> words are used to signify things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, which is represented in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; or again, pertaining to <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Christ's mystical body</a>, which is signified therein; and again, things pertaining to the use of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which use ought to be devout and reverent. Consequently, in the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> some things are done in order to represent <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, or the disposing of His <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a>, and some others are done which pertain to the devotion and reverence due to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The washing of the hands is done in the celebration of mass out of reverence for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; and this for two reasons: first, because we are not wont to handle precious objects except the hands be washed; hence it seems indecent for anyone to approach so great a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> with hands that are, even literally, unclean. Secondly, on account of its signification, because, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii), the washing of the extremities of the limbs denotes cleansing from even the smallest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse10">John 13:10</a>: "He that is washed needeth not but to wash his feet." And such cleansing is required of him who approaches this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; and this is denoted by the confession which is made before the "Introit" of the mass. Moreover, this was signified by the washing of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii). However, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> observes this ceremony, not because it was prescribed under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, but because it is becoming in itself, and therefore instituted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence it is not observed in the same way as it was then: because the washing of the feet is omitted, and the washing of the hands is observed; for this can be done more readily, and suffices far denoting perfect cleansing. For, since the hand is the "organ of organs" (De Anima iii), all works are attributed to the hands: hence it is said in <a href="../bible/psa025.htm#verse6">Psalm 25:6</a>: "I will wash my hands among the innocent."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We use <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, not as commanded by a ceremonial precept of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, but as prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; accordingly we do not use it in the same fashion as it was ordered under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. It has reference to two things: first, to the reverence due to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, i.e. in order by its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> odor, to remove any disagreeable smell that may be about the place; secondly, it serves to show the effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, wherewith <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was filled as with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> odor, according to <a href="../bible/gen027.htm#verse27">Genesis 27:27</a>: "Behold, the odor of my son is like the odor of a ripe field"; and from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> it spreads to the faithful by the work of His ministers, according to <a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>: "He manifesteth the odor of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by us in every place"; and therefore when the altar which represents <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, has been <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a> on every side, then all are <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a> in their proper order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in celebrating the mass, makes use of the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> to signify <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> which was ended upon the cross. Now, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was accomplished in certain stages. First of all there was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> betrayal, which was the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>; and this is signified by the triple <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> at the words, "These <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, these presents, these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> unspotted <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>."

<p>Secondly, there was the selling of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now he was sold to the Priests, to the Scribes, and to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>: and to signify this the threefold sign of the cross is repeated, at the words, "blessed, enrolled, ratified." Or again, to signify the price for which He was sold, viz. thirty pence. And a double cross is added at the words--"that it may become to us the Body and the Blood," etc., to signify the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> the seller, and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who was sold.

<p>Thirdly, there was the foreshadowing of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">last supper</a>. To denote this, in the third place, two crosses are made, one in <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the body, the other in <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the blood; each time while saying, "He blessed."

<p>Fourthly, there was <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> itself. And so in order to represent His five wounds, in the fourth place, there is a fivefold signing of the cross at the words, "a pure Victim, a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Victim, a spotless Victim, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> bread of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, and the cup of everlasting <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>."

<p>Fifthly, the outstretching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, and the shedding of the blood, and the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, are signified by the triple signing of the cross at the words, "as many as shall receive the body and blood, may be filled with every <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>," etc.

<p>Sixthly, Christ's threefold <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> upon the cross is represented; one for His persecutors when He said, "Father, forgive them"; the second for deliverance from death, when He cried, "My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" the third referring to His entrance into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, when He said, "Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit"; and in order to denote these there is a triple signing with the cross made at the words, "Thou dost sanctify, quicken, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a>."

<p>Seventhly, the three hours during which He hung upon the cross, that is, from the sixth to the ninth hour, are represented; in signification of which we make once more a triple <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> at the words, "Through Him, and with Him, and in Him."

<p>Eighthly, the separation of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body is signified by the two subsequent crosses made over the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>.

<p>Ninthly, the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> on the third day is represented by the three crosses made at the words--"May the peace of the Lord be ever with you."

<p>In short, we may say that the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and the acceptance of this sacrifice, and its fruits, proceed from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and therefore wherever mention is made of these, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> makes use of the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> After the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> makes the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, not for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a>, but only for calling to mind the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the cross, and the manner of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> suffering, as is evident from what has been said (ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The actions performed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in mass are not ridiculous gestures, since they are done so as to represent something else. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in extending his arms signifies the outstretching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> arms upon the cross. He also lifts up his hands as he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, to point out that his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the people, according to <a href="../bible/lam003.htm#verse41">Lamentations 3:41</a>: "Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the Lord in the heavens": and <a href="../bible/exo017.htm#verse11">Exodus 17:11</a>: "And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> lifted up his hands <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> overcame." That at times he joins his hands, and bows down, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> earnestly and humbly, denotes the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and obedience of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, out of which He suffered. He closes his fingers, i.e. the thumb and first finger, after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, because, with them, he had touched the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> body of Christ; so that if any particle cling to the fingers, it may not be scattered: and this belongs to the reverence for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Five times does the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> turn round towards the people, to denote that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> manifested Himself five times on the day of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, as stated above in the treatise on <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> (55, 3, Objection 3). But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> greets the people seven times, namely, five times, by turning round to the people, and twice without turning round, namely, when he says, "The Lord be with you" before the "Preface," and again when he says, "May the peace of the Lord be ever with you": and this is to denote the sevenfold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, when he celebrates on festival days, in his first greeting says, "Peace be to you," which was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> greeting after <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, Whose <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> chiefly represents.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The breaking of the host denotes three things: first, the rending of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, which took place in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>; secondly, the distinction of His <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a> according to its various states; and thirdly, the distribution of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> which flow from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> observes (Eccl. Hier. iii). Hence this breaking does not imply severance in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> As Pope Sergius says, and it is to be found in the Decretals (De Consecr., dist. ii), "the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord's</a> body is threefold; the part offered and put into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> signifies Christ's risen body," namely, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and the other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, if there be any, who are already in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with their bodies. "The part consumed denotes those still walking upon earth," because while living upon earth they are united together by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; and are bruised by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, just as the bread eaten is bruised by the teeth. "The part reserved on the altar till the close of the mass, is His body hidden in the sepulchre, because the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be in their graves until the end of the world": though their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are either in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, or in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. However, this rite of reserving one part on the altar till the close of the mass is no longer observed, on account of the danger; nevertheless, the same meaning of the parts continues, which some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have expressed in verse, thus: <blockquote> "The host being rent--<br> What is dipped, means the blest;<br> What is dry, means the living;<br> What is kept, those at rest."<br> </blockquote> Others, however, say that the part put into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> denotes those still living in this world. while the part kept outside the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> denotes those fully blessed both in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; while the part consumed means the others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> Two things can be signified by the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>: first, the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> itself, which is represented in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and according to this, by the part put into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> are denoted those who are still sharers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sufferings; secondly, the enjoyment of the Blessed can be signified, which is likewise foreshadowed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; and therefore those whose bodies are already in full beatitude, are denoted by the part put into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. And it is to be observed that the part put into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> ought not to be given to the people to supplement the communion, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave dipped bread only to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> the betrayer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 10.</strong> Wine, by reason of its humidity, is capable of washing, consequently it is received in order to rinse the mouth after receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, lest any particles remain: and this belongs to reverence for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Hence (Extra, De Celebratione missae, chap. Ex parte), it is said: "The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should always cleanse his mouth with wine after receiving the entire sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>: except when he has to celebrate another mass on the same day, lest from taking the ablution-wine he be prevented from celebrating again"; and it is for the same reason that wine is poured over the fingers with which he had touched the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 11.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ought to be conformable with the figure, in some respect: namely, because a part of the host <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and ministers or even the people communicate, ought not to be reserved until the day following. Hence, as is laid down (De Consecr., dist. ii), Pope Clement I ordered that "as many hosts are to be offered on the altar as shall suffice for the people; should any be left over, they are not to be reserved until the morrow, but let the clergy carefully consume them with fear and trembling." Nevertheless, since this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is to be received daily, whereas the Paschal Lamb was not, it is therefore <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for other hosts to be reserved for the sick. Hence we read in the same distinction: "Let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> always have the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> ready, so that, when anyone fall sick, he may take Communion to him at once, lest he die without it."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 12.</strong> Several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> ought to be present at the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> celebration of the mass. Hence Pope Soter says (De Consecr., dist. 1): "It has also been ordained, that no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is to presume to celebrate <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> mass, unless two others be present answering him, while he himself makes the third; because when he says in the plural, 'The Lord be with you,' and again in the Secrets, '<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> ye for me,' it is most becoming that they should answer his greeting." Hence it is for the sake of greater <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> that we find it decreed (De Consecr. dist. 1) that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to solemnize mass with several assistants. Nevertheless, in private masses it suffices to have one server, who takes the place of the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people, on whose behalf he makes answer in the plural to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the defects occurring during the celebration of this sacrament can be sufficiently met by observing the Church's statutes?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the defects occurring during the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> cannot be sufficiently met by observing the statutes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For it sometimes happens that before or after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> dies or goes mad, or is hindered by some other infirmity from receiving the sacrament and completing the mass. Consequently it seems impossible to observe the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> statute, whereby the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> must communicate of his own sacrifice.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it sometimes happens that, before the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> remembers that he has eaten or drunk something, or that he is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or under <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, which he did not remember previously. Therefore, in such a dilemma a man must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> commit mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by acting against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> statute, whether he receives or not.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it sometimes happens that a fly or a spider, or some other poisonous creature falls into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> after the consecration. Or even that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> comes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that poison has been put in by some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evilly</a> disposed <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in order to kill him. Now in this instance, if he takes it, he appears to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by killing himself, or by <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: also in like manner if he does not take it, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by acting against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> statute. Consequently, he seems to be perplexed, and under <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, which is not becoming.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it sometimes happens from the server's want of heed that water is not added to the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, or even the wine overlooked, and that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> discovers this. Therefore he seems to be perplexed likewise in this case, whether he receives the body without the blood, thus making the sacrifice to be incomplete, or whether he receives neither the body nor the blood.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it sometimes happens that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot remember having said the words of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, or other words which are uttered in the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. In this case he seems to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whether he repeats the words over the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which words possibly he has said before, or whether he uses bread and wine which are not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, as if they were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, it sometimes comes to pass owing to the cold that the host will slip from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> hands into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, either before or after the breaking. In this case then the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> will not be able to comply with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> rite, either as to the breaking, or else as to this, that only a third part is put into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, sometimes, too, it happens, owing to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> want of care, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood is spilled, or that he vomits the sacrament received, or that the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> hosts are kept so long that they become corrupt, or that they are nibbled by mice, or lost in any manner whatsoever; in which cases it does not seem possible for due reverence to be shown towards this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ordinances require. It does not seem then that such defects or dangers can be met by keeping to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> statutes.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not command an impossibility, so neither does the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Dangers or defects happening to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can be met in two ways: first, by preventing any such mishaps from occurring: secondly, by dealing with them in such a way, that what may have happened amiss is put right, either by employing a remedy, or at least by repentance on his part who has acted negligently regarding this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> be stricken by death or grave sickness before the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> body and blood, there is no need for it to be completed by another. But if this happens after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is begun, for instance, when the body has been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and before the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the blood, or even after both have been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, then the celebration of the mass ought to be finished by someone else. Hence, as is laid down (Decretal vii, q. 1), we read the following decree of the (Seventh) Council of Toledo: "We consider it to be fitting that when the sacred mysteries are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> during the time of mass, if any sickness supervenes, in consequence of which they cannot finish the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> begun, let it be free for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to finish the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the office thus begun. For nothing else is suitable for completing the mysteries commenced, unless the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> be completed either by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who began it, or by the one who follows him: because they cannot be completed except they be performed in perfect order. For since we are all one in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the change of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> makes no difference, since unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> insures the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> issue of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. Yet let not the course we propose for cases of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> debility, be presumptuously abused: and let no minister or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> presume ever to leave the Divine offices unfinished, unless he be absolutely prevented from continuing. If anyone shall have rashly presumed to do so, he will incur sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Where difficulty arises, the less dangerous course should always be followed. But the greatest danger regarding this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> lies in whatever may prevent its completion, because this is a heinous <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>; while that danger is of less account which regards the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the receiver. Consequently, if after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> has been begun the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> remembers that he has eaten or drunk anything, he ought nevertheless to complete the sacrifice and receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Likewise, if he recalls a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed, he ought to make an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, with the firm purpose of confessing and making satisfaction for it: and thus he will not receive the sacrament unworthily, but with profit. The same applies if he calls to mind that he is under some <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>; for he ought to make the resolution of humbly seeking <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>; and so he will receive <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from the invisible <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High Priest</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> for his act of completing the Divine mysteries.

<p>But if he calls to mind any of the above facts previous to the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, I should deem it safer for him to interrupt the mass begun, especially if he has broken his fast, or is under <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, unless grave <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> were to be feared.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If a fly or a spider falls into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> before <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, or if it be discovered that the wine is poisoned, it ought to be poured out, and after purifying the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, fresh wine should be served for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. But if anything of the sort happen after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the insect should be caught carefully and washed thoroughly, then burned, and the "ablution," together with the ashes, thrown into the sacrarium. If it be discovered that the wine has been poisoned, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should neither receive it nor administer it to others on any account, lest the life-giving <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> become one of death, but it ought to be kept in a suitable vessel with the relics: and in order that the sacrament may not remain incomplete, he ought to put other wine into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, resume the mass from the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the blood, and complete the sacrifice.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> If before the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the blood, and after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the body the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> detect that either the wine or the water is absent, then he ought at once to add them and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>. But if after the words of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> he discover that the water is absent, he ought notwithstanding to proceed straight on, because the addition of the water is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (Question 74, Article 7): nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> responsible for the neglect ought to be punished. And on no account should water be mixed with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine, because corruption of the sacrament would ensue in part, as was said above (Question 77, Article 8). But if after the words of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> perceive that no wine has been put in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, and if he detect it before receiving the body, then rejecting the water, he ought to pour in wine with water, and begin over again the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> words of the blood. But if he notice it after receiving the body, he ought to procure another host which must be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> together with the blood; and I say so for this reason, because if he were to say only the words of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the blood, the proper order of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> would not be observed; and, as is laid down by the Council of Toledo, quoted above (ad 1), <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> cannot be perfect, except they be performed in perfect order. But if he were to begin from the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the blood, and were to repeat all the words which follow, it would not suffice, unless there was a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> host present, since in those words there are things to be said and done not only regarding the blood, but also regarding the body; and at the close he ought once more to receive the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> host and blood, even if he had already taken the water which was in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, because the precept of the completing this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is of greater weight than the precept of receiving the sacrament while <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, as stated above (Question 80, Article 8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may not recollect having said some of the words he ought to say, he ought not to be disturbed <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> on that account; for a man who utters many words cannot recall to mind all that he has said; unless perchance in uttering them he adverts to something connected with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; for so it is impressed on the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. Hence, if a man pays attention to what he is saying, but without adverting to the fact that he is saying these particular words, he remembers soon after that he has said them; for, a thing is presented to the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> under the formality of the past (De Mem. et Remin. i).

<p>But if it seem to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> that he has probably omitted some of the words that are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, I think that he ought not to repeat them on that account, changing the order of the sacrifice, but that he ought to proceed: but if he is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he has left out any of those that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, namely, the form of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, since the form of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is, it seems that the same thing ought to be done as was stated above (ad 4) with regard to defect in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, namely, that he should begin again with the form of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and repeat the other things in order, lest the order of the sacrifice be altered.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The breaking of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> host, and the putting of only one part into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, regards the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a>, just as the mixing with water signifies the people, and therefore the omission of either of them <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> no such imperfection in the sacrifice, as calls for repetition regarding the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> According to the decree, De Consecr., dist. ii, quoting a decree of Pope Pius I, "If from neglect any of the blood falls upon a board which is fixed to the ground, let it be taken up with the tongue, and let the board be scraped. But if it be not a board, let the ground be scraped, and the scrapings burned, and the ashes buried inside the altar and let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> do penance for forty days. But if a drop fall from the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> on to the altar, let the minister suck up the drop, and do penance during three days; if it falls upon the altar cloth and penetrates to the second altar cloth, let him do four days' penance; if it penetrates to the third, let him do nine days' penance; if to the fourth, let him do twenty days' penance; and let the altar linens which the drop touched be washed three times by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, holding the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> below, then let the water be taken and put away nigh to the altar." It might even be drunk by the minister, unless it might be rejected from nausea. Some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> go further, and cut out that part of the linen, which they burn, putting the ashes in the altar or down the sacrarium. And the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> continues with a quotation from the Penitential of Bede the Priest: "If, owing to drunkenness or <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, anyone vomits up the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, let him do forty days' penance, if he be a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>; but let <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or monks, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, do seventy days' penance; and let a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> do ninety days'. But if they vomit from sickness, let them do penance for seven days." And in the same distinction, we read a decree of the (Fourth) Council of Arles: "They who do not keep proper custody over the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, if a mouse or other animal consume it, must do forty days' penance: he who loses it in a church, or if a part fall and be not found, shall do thirty days' penance." And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> seems to deserve the same penance, who from neglect allows the hosts to putrefy. And on those days the one doing penance ought to fast, and abstain from Communion. However, after weighing the circumstances of the fact and of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the said penances may be lessened or increased. But it must be observed that wherever the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are found to be entire, they must be preserved reverently, or consumed; because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is there so long as the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> last, as stated above (77, 4,5). But if it can be done conveniently, the things in which they are found are to be burned, and the ashes put in the sacrarium, as was said of the scrapings of the altar-table, here above.
