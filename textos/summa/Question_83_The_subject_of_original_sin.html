<h1>Question 83. The subject of original sin</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2083.htm#article1"> Is the subject of original sin the flesh rather than the soul?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2083.htm#article2"> If it be the soul, is this through its essence, or through its powers?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2083.htm#article3"> Is the will prior to the other powers the subject of original sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2083.htm#article4"> Are certain powers of the soul specially infected, viz. the generative power, the concupiscible part, and the sense of touch?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether original sin is more in the flesh than in the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is more in the flesh than in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Because the rebellion of the flesh against the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> arises from the corruption of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Now the root of this rebellion is seated in the flesh: for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans 7:23</a>): "I see another <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in my members fighting against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of my mind." Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is seated chiefly in the flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing is more in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> than in its effect: thus heat is in the heating fire more than in the hot water. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is infected with the corruption of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> by the carnal semen. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is in the flesh rather than in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> from our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, in so far as we were in him by reason of seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were not in him thus, but only our flesh. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but in the flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is infused into the body. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were infected with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, it would follow that it is corrupted in its creation or infusion: and thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since He is the author of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> creation and fusion.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, no wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> pours a precious liquid into a vessel, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the vessel will corrupt the liquid. But the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more precious than any liquid. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by being united with the body, could be corrupted with the infection of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is wisdom itself, would never infuse the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into such a body. And yet He does; wherefore it is not corrupted by the flesh. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but in the flesh.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The same is the subject of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> contrary to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But the flesh cannot be the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse18">Romans 7:18</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there dwelleth not in me, that is to say, in my flesh, that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Therefore the flesh cannot be the subject of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, but only the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> One thing can be in another in two ways. First, as in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, either principal, or instrumental; secondly, as in its subject. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> indeed, as in its principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, according to the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>): "In whom all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>": whereas it is in the bodily semen, as in its instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, since it is by the active power of the semen that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> together with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is transmitted to the child. But <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> can nowise be in the flesh as its subject, but only in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>The reason for this is that, as stated above (Question 81, Article 1), <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is transmitted from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> to this posterity by a certain movement of generation, in the same way as actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is transmitted from any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will to his other parts. Now in this transmission it is to be observed, that whatever accrues from the motion of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> consenting to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to any part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that can in any way share in that guilt, either as its subject or as its instrument, has the character of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Thus from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> consenting to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of food accrues to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, and partaking of food accrues to the hand and the mouth, which, in so far as they are moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are the instruments of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But that further action is evoked in the nutritive power and the internal members, which have no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude for being moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, does not bear the character of guilt.

<p>Accordingly, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can be the subject of guilt, while the flesh, of itself, cannot be the subject of guilt; whatever accrues to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the corruption of the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, has the character of guilt, while whatever accrues to the flesh, has the character, not of guilt but of punishment: so that, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, and not the flesh.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 27) [Cf. QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 66, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking, in that passage, of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> already redeemed, who is delivered from guilt, but is still liable to punishment, by reason of which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is stated to dwell "in the flesh." Consequently it follows that the flesh is the subject, not of guilt, but of punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the semen as instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now there is no need for anything to be more in the instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> than in the effect; but only in the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: and, in this way, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> more fully, since in him it had the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, in respect of his seminal power, not indeed as in its effective principle, but as in a dispositive principle: because the bodily semen, which is transmitted from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, does not of its own power produce the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but disposes the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The corruption of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is nowise <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> through carnal generation. And so, since creation implies a relation in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, it cannot be said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is tainted through being <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. On the other hand, infusion implies relation both to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> infusing and to the flesh into which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is infused. And so, with regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> infusing, it cannot be said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is stained through being infused; but only with regard to the body into which it is infused.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> takes precedence of private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to His wisdom, does not overlook the general order of things (which is that such a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be infused into such a body), lest this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> contract a singular corruption: all the more that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> demands that it should not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> prior to its infusion into the body, as stated in the I, 90, 4; I, 118, 3. And it is better for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be thus, according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, than not to be at all, especially since it can avoid damnation, by means of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether original sin is in the essence of the soul rather than in the powers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rather than in the powers. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> apt to be the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in respect of those parts which can be moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, not as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> but only as to the powers. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not according to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but only according to the powers.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is opposed to original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> was in a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because power is the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> also is in a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, rather than in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as from the flesh, so is it derived by the powers from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is more in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than in the flesh. Therefore it is more in the powers than in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, as stated (82, 3). But <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is in the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is called the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (Question 81, Article 1). Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the form and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body, in respect of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and not in respect of its powers, as stated in the I, 76, 6. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> chiefly in respect of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The subject of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is chiefly that part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to which the motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> primarily pertains: thus if the motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is sensual pleasure, which regards the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power through being its proper object, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power is the proper subject of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it is evident that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> through our origin. Consequently that part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is first reached by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> origin, is the primary subject of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Now the origin reaches the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as the term of generation, according as it is the form of the body: and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in respect of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the I, 76, 6. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in respect of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, is the primary subject of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the motion of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> reaches to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers and not to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so the motion of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the first generator, through the channel of generation, reaches first of all to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> pertained radically to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because it was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to which the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is related before the powers. For the powers seem to regard the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, in as much as they are the principles of personal acts. Hence they are the proper subjects of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which are the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The body is related to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to form, which though it comes second in order of generation, nevertheless comes first in the order of perfection and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is related to the powers, as a subject to its proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, which follow their subject both in the order of generation and in that of perfection. Consequently the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Concupiscence, in relation to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, holds the position of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and effect, as stated above (Question 82, Article 3).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether original sin infects the will before the other powers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> does not infect the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> before the other powers. For every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> belongs chiefly to that power by whose act it was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an act of the generative power. Therefore it seems to belong to the generative power more than to the others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is transmitted through the carnal semen. But the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are more akin to the flesh than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is, as is evident with regard to all the sensitive powers, which use a bodily organ. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is in them more than in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> precedes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, for the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is only the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> understood. If therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> infects all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it seems that it must first of all infect the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as preceding the others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has a prior relation to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, because it is "rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>," as <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> states (De Concep. Virg. iii). Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, which is opposed to it, also has a prior relation to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things must be considered in the infection of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. First, its inherence to its subject; and in this respect it regards first the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). In the second place we must consider its inclination to act; and in this way it regards the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. It must therefore regard first of all that power in which is seated the first inclination to commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (74, A1,2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> regards first of all the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the generative power of the child, but by the act of the parental generative power. Consequently, it does not follow that the child's generative power is the subject of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> spreads in two ways; from the flesh to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the powers. The former follows the order of generation, the latter follows the order of perfection. Therefore, although the other, viz. the sensitive powers, are more akin to the flesh, yet, since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, being the higher power, is more akin to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the infection of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> reaches it first.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> precedes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in one way, by proposing its object to it. In another way, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> precedes the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in the order of motion to act, which motion pertains to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the aforesaid powers are more infected than the others?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the aforesaid powers are not more infected than the others. For the infection of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> seems to pertain more to that part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which can be first the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now this is the rational part, and chiefly the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore that power is most infected by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is infected by guilt, except in so far as it can obey reason. Now the generative power cannot obey reason, as stated in Ethic. i, 13. Therefore the generative power is not the most infected by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, of all the senses the sight is the most <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and the nearest to reason, in so far "as it shows us how a number of things differ" (Metaph. i). But the infection of guilt is first of all in the reason. Therefore the sight is more infected than touch.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 16, seqq., 24) that the infection of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is most apparent in the movements of the members of generation, which are not subject to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now those members serve the generative power in the mingling of sexes, wherein there is the delectation of touch, which is the most powerful incentive to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Therefore the infection of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> regards these three chiefly, viz. the generative power, the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty and the sense of touch.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Those corruptions especially are said to be infectious, which are of such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to be transmitted from one subject to another: hence contagious diseases, such as <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> and murrain and the like, are said to be infectious. Now the corruption of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is transmitted by the act of generation, as stated above (Question 81, Article 1). Therefore the powers which concur in this act, are chiefly said to be infected. Now this act serves the generative power, in as much as it is directed to generation; and it includes delectation of the touch, which is the most powerful object of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty. Consequently, while all the parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are said to be corrupted by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, these three are said specially to be corrupted and infected.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as it inclines to actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, belongs chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But in so far as it is transmitted to the offspring, it belongs to the aforesaid powers proximately, and to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, remotely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The infection of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> belongs only to the powers which are moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the sinner. But the infection of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not derived from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the contractor, but through his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> origin, which is effected by the generative power. Hence it is this power that is infected by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sight is not related to the act of generation except in respect of remote disposition, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is seen through the sight. But the delectation is completed in the touch. Wherefore the aforesaid infection is ascribed to the touch rather than to the sight.
