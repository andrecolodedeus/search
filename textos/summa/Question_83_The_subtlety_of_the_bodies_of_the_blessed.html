<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether subtlety is a property of the glorified body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that subtlety is not a property of the glorified body. For the properties of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> surpass the properties of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, even as the clarity of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> surpasses the clarity of the sun, which is the greatest in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Accordingly if subtlety be a property of the glorified body, it would seem that the glorified body will be more subtle than anything which is subtle in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and thus it will be "more subtle than the wind and the air," which was condemned by Gregory in the city of <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a>, as he relates (Moral. xiv, 56).

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as heat and cold are simple <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of bodies, i.e. of the elements, so is subtlety. But heat and other <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the elements will not be intensified in the glorified bodies any more than they are now, in fact, they will be more reduced to the mean. Neither, therefore, will subtlety be in them more than it is now.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, subtlety is in bodies as a result of scarcity of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, wherefore bodies that have less <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> within equal dimensions are said to be more subtle; as fire in comparison with air, and air as compared with water, and water as compared with earth. But there will be as much <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in the glorified bodies as there is now, nor will their dimensions be greater. Therefore they will not be more subtle then than now.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse44">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>): "It is sown a corruptible body, it shall rise a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>," i.e. a spirit-like, "body." But the subtlety of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> surpasses all bodily subtlety. Therefore the glorified bodies will be most subtle.

<p>Further, the more subtle a body is the more exalted it is. But the glorified bodies will be most exalted. Therefore they will be most subtle.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Subtlety takes its name from the power to penetrate. Hence it is said in De Gener. ii that "a subtle thing fills all the parts and the parts of parts." Now that a body has the power of penetrating may happen through two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. First, through smallness of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, especially in respect of depth and breadth, but not of length, because penetration regards depth, wherefore length is not an obstacle to penetration. Secondly, through paucity of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, wherefore rarity is synonymous with subtlety: and since in rare bodies the form is more predominant over the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the term "subtlety" has been transferred to those bodies which are most perfectly subject to their form, and are most fully perfected thereby: thus we speak of subtlety in the sun and moon and like bodies, just as gold and similar things may be called subtle, when they are most perfectly complete in their specific being and power. And since incorporeal things lack <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the term "subtlety" is applied to them, not only by reason of their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but also on account of their power. For just as a subtle thing is said to be penetrative, for the reason that it reaches to the inmost part of a thing, so is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> said to be subtle because it reaches to the insight of the intrinsic principles and the hidden <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> properties of a thing. In like manner a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to have subtle sight, because he is able to perceive by sight things of the smallest size: and the same applies to the other senses. Accordingly people have differed by ascribing subtlety to the glorified bodies in different ways.

<p>For certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> relates (De Civ. Dei xiii, 22), ascribed to them the subtlety whereby <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are said to be subtle: and they said that at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the body will be transformed into a spirit, and that for this reason the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> describes as being "<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>" the bodies of those who rise again (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse44">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>). But this cannot be maintained. First, because a body cannot be changed into a spirit, since there is no community of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> between them: and <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> proves this (De Duab. Nat.). Secondly, because, if this were possible, and one's body were changed into a spirit, one would not rise again a man, for a man <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> consists of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. Thirdly, because if this were the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> meaning, just as he speaks of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> bodies, so would he speak of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> [animale] bodies, as being changed into <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> [animam]: and this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p>Hence certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> said that the body will remain at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, but that it will be endowed with subtlety by means of rarefaction, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies in rising again will be like the air or the wind, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> relates (Moral. xiv, 56). But this again cannot be maintained, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> had a palpable body after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, as appears from the last chapter of Luke, and we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that His body was supremely subtle. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body will rise again with flesh and bones, as did the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke 24:39</a>, "A spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see Me to have," and <a href="../bible/job019.htm#verse26">Job 19:26</a>, "In my flesh I shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," my Saviour: and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of flesh and bone is incompatible with the aforesaid rarity.

<p>Consequently another kind of subtlety must be assigned to glorified bodies, by saying that they are subtle on account of the most complete perfection of the body. But this completeness is explained by some in relation to the fifth, or heavenly, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which will be then predominant in them. This, however, is impossible, since first of all the fifth <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> can nowise enter into the composition of a body, as we have shown above (Sent. D, 12, qu. 1). Secondly, because granted that it entered into the composition of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, it would be impossible to account for its having a greater predominance over the elemental <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> then than now, unless--either the amount of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies were increased (thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies would not be of the same stature, unless perhaps elemental <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were decreased, which is inconsistent with the integrity of those who rise again)--or unless elemental <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> were endowed with the properties of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> through the latter's dominion over the body, and in that case a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power would be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a property of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which seems absurd.

<p>Hence others say that the aforesaid completeness by reason of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies are said to be subtle will result from the dominion of the glorified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (which is the form of the body) over the body, by reason of which dominion the glorified body is said to be "<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>," as being wholly subject to the spirit. The first subjection whereby the body is subject to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to the effect of its participating in its specific being, in so far as it is subject to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to form; and secondly it is subject to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in respect of the other operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a principle of movement. Consequently the first reason for spirituality in the body is subtlety, and, after that, agility and the other properties of a glorified body. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, as the masters expound, in speaking of spirituality indicates subtlety: wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xiv, 56) that "the glorified body is said to be subtle as a result of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power."

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections which refer to the subtlety of rarefaction.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether by reason of this subtlety a glorified body is able to be in the same place with another body not glorified?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that by reason of this subtlety a body is able to be in the same place with another body not glorified. For according to <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a>, "He will reform the body of our lowness made like to the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Now the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was able to be in the same place with another body, as appears from the fact that after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> He went in to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, the doors being shut (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse19">John 20:19-26</a>). Therefore also the glorified bodies by reason of their subtlety will be able to be in the same place with other bodies not glorified.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, glorified bodies will be superior to all other bodies. Yet by reason of their superiority certain bodies, to wit the solar rays, are able now to occupy the same place together with other bodies. Much more therefore is this befitting glorified bodies.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a heavenly body cannot be severed, at least as regards the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the spheres: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/job037.htm#verse18">Job 37:18</a>) that "the heavens . . . are most strong, as if they were of molten brass." If then the subtlety of a glorified body will not enable it to be in the same place together with another body, it will never be able to ascend to the empyrean,* and this is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. [The empyrean was the highest of the concentric spheres or heavens, and was identified by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers with the abode of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Cf. I, 56, 3].

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a body which is unable to be in the same place with another body can be hindered in its movement or even surrounded by others standing in its way. But this cannot happen to glorified bodies. Therefore they will be able to be together in the same place with other bodies.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, as point is to point, so is line to line, surface to surface, and body to body. Now two points can be coincident, as in the case of two lines touching one another, and two lines when two surfaces are in contact with one another, and two surfaces when two bodies touch one another, because "contiguous things are those whose boundaries coincide" (Phys. vi, 6). Therefore it is not against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a body to be in the same place together with another body. Now whatever excellence is competent to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a body will all be bestowed on the glorified body. Therefore a glorified body, by reason of its subtlety, will be able to be in the same place together with another body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin. i): "Difference of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> makes distinction in number. For three men differ not in genus, nor in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but in their <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. If we were to remove absolutely every <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> from them, still each one has a different place; and it is quite conceivable that they should all occupy the same place." Therefore if we suppose two bodies to occupy the same place, there will be but one body numerically.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It cannot be maintained that a glorified body, by reason of its subtlety, is able to be in the same place with another body, unless the obstacle to its being now in the same place with another body be removed by that subtlety. Some say that in the present state this obstacle is its grossness by virtue of which it is able to occupy a place; and that this grossness is removed by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of subtlety. But there are two reasons why this cannot be maintained. First, because the grossness which the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of subtlety removes is a kind of defect, for instance an inordinateness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in not being perfectly subject to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. For all that pertains to the integrity of the body will rise again in the body, both as regards the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and as regards the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. And the fact that a body is able to fill a place belongs to it by reason of that which pertains to its integrity, and not on account of any defect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For since fulness is opposed to vacancy, that alone does not fill a place, which being put in a place, nevertheless leaves a place vacant. Now a vacuum is defined by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iv, 6,7) as being "a place not filled by a sensible body." And a body is said to be sensible by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, form, and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, all of which pertain to the integrity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. It is also plain that the glorified body will be sensible even to touch, as evidenced by the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke 24:39</a>): nor will it lack <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or form, or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, namely heat, cold, and so forth. Hence it is evident that the glorified body, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of subtlety notwithstanding, will fill a place: for it would seem <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to say that the place in which there will be a glorified body will be empty. Secondly their aforesaid argument does not avail, because to hinder the co-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a body in the same place is more than to fill a place. For if we suppose dimensions separate from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, those dimensions do not fill a place. Hence some who held the possibility of a vacuum, said that a vacuum is a place wherein such like dimensions <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> apart from a sensible body; and yet those dimensions hinder another body from being together with them in the same place. This is made clear by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iv, 1,8; Metaph. ii, 2), where he considers it impossible for a mathematical body, which is nothing but separate dimensions, to be together with another <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sensible body. Consequently, granted that the subtlety of a glorified body hindered it from filling a place, nevertheless it would not follow that for this reason it is able to be in the same place with another body, since the removal of the lesser does not involve the removal of the greater.

<p>Accordingly we must say that the obstacle to our body's being now in the same place with another body can nowise be removed by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of subtlety. For nothing can prevent a body from occupying the same place together with another body, except something in it that requires a different place: since nothing is an obstacle to identity, save that which is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of distinction. Now this distinction of place is not required by any <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the body, because a body demands a place, not by reason of its <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>: wherefore if we remove from a body the fact of its being hot or cold, heavy or light, it still retains the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the aforesaid distinction, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. iv), and as is self-evident. In like manner neither can <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the aforesaid distinction, because <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not occupy a place except through its dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Again neither does form occupy a place, unless it have a place through its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. It remains therefore that the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for two bodies occupying each a distinct place results from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, to which a place is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> befitting. For this forms part of its definition, since dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> occupying a place. Hence it is that if we remove all else in a thing from it, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of this distinction is found in its dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> alone. Thus take the example of a separate line, supposing there to be two such lines, or two parts of one line, they must needs occupy distinct places, else one line added to another would not make something greater, and this is against <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a>. The same applies to surfaces and mathematical bodies. And since <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> demands place, through being the subject of dimension, the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> results in placed <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so that just as it is impossible for there to be two lines, or two parts of a line, unless they occupy distinct places, so is it impossible for there to be two matters, or two parts of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, without there be distinction of place. And since distinction of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the principle of the distinction between <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, it follows that, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin.), "we cannot possibly conceive two bodies occupying one place," so that this distinction of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> requires this difference of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. Now subtlety does not deprive the glorified body of its dimension; wherefore it nowise removes from it the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of occupying a distinct place from another body. Therefore the subtlety of a glorified body will not enable it to be in the same place together with another body, but it will be possible for it to be together with another body by the operation of the Divine power: even as the body of Peter had the power whereby the sick were healed at the passing of Peter's shadow (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse15">Acts 5:15</a>) not through any inherent property, but by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the upbuilding of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Thus will the Divine power make it possible for a glorified body to be in the same place together with another body for the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was able to be together with another body in the same place was not due to its subtlety, but resulted from the power of His Godhead after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, even as in His birth [Cf. III, 28, 2, ad 3]. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxvi in Evang.): "The same body went into His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the doors being shut, which to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> eyes came from the closed womb of the Virgin at His birth." Therefore there is no reason why this should be befitting to glorified bodies on account of their subtlety.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Light is not a body as we have said above (Sent. ii, 13, 3; I, 67, 2): hence the objection proceeds on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> supposition.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The glorified body will pass through the heavenly spheres without severing them, not by virtue of its subtlety, but by the Divine power, which will assist them in all things at will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> From the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will come to the aid of the blessed at will in whatever they desire, it follows that they cannot be surrounded or imprisoned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As stated in Phys. iv, 5, "a point is not in a place": hence if it be said to be in a place, this is only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, because the body of which it is a term is in a place. And just as the whole place corresponds to the whole body, so the term of the place corresponds to the term of the body. But it happens that two places have one term, even as two lines terminate in one point. And consequently though two bodies must needs be in distinct places, yet the same term of two places corresponds to the two terms of the two bodies. It is in this sense that the bounds of contiguous bodies are said to coincide.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it is possible, by a miracle, for two bodies to be in the same place?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not even by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is it possible for two bodies to be in the same place. For it is not possible that, by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, two bodies be at once two and one, since this would imply that contradictions are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> at the same time. But if we suppose two bodies to be in the same place, it would follow that those two bodies are one. Therefore this cannot be done by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. The minor is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> thus. Suppose two bodies A and B to be in the same place. The dimensions of A will either be the same as the dimensions of the place, or they will differ from them. If they differ, then some of the dimensions will be separate: which is impossible, since the dimensions that are within the bounds of a place are not in a subject unless they be in a placed body. If they be the same, then for the same reason the dimensions of B will be the same as the dimensions of the place. "Now things that are the same with one and the same thing are the same with one another." Therefore the dimensions of A and B are the same. But two bodies cannot have identical dimensions just as they cannot have the same whiteness. Therefore A and B are one body and yet they were two. Therefore they are at the same time one and two.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing cannot be done <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> either against the common principles--for instance that the part be not less than the whole; since what is contrary to common principles implies a direct contradiction--or contrary to the conclusions of geometry which are <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deductions</a> from common principles--for instance that the three angles of a triangle should not be equal to two right angles. In like manner nothing can be done to a line that is contrary to the definition of a line, because to sever the definition from the defined is to make two contradictories <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> at the same time. Now it is contrary to common principles, both to the conclusions of geometry and to the definition of a line, for two bodies to be in the same place. Therefore this cannot be done by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. The minor is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> as follows: It is a conclusion of geometry that two circles touch one another only at a point. Now if two circular bodies were in the same place, the two circles described in them would touch one another as a whole. Again it is contrary to the definition of a line that there be more than one straight line between two points: yet this would be the case were two bodies in the same place, since between two given points in the various surfaces of the place, there would be two straight lines corresponding to the two bodies in that place.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it would seem impossible that by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> a body which is enclosed within another should not be in a place, for then it would have a common and not a proper place, and this is impossible. Yet this would follow if two bodies were in the same place. Therefore this cannot be done by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. The minor is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> thus. Supposing two bodies to be in the same place, the one being greater than the other as to every dimension, the lesser body will be enclosed in the greater, and the place occupied by the greater body will be its common place; while it will have no proper place, because no given surface of the body will contain it, and this is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to place. Therefore it will not have a proper place.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, place corresponds in proportion to the thing placed. Now it can never happen by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> that the same body is at the same time in different places, except by some kind of transformation, as in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the Altar</a>. Therefore it can nowise happen by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> that two bodies be together in the same place.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> gave birth to her Son by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. Now in this hallowed birth it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for two bodies to be together in the same place, because the body of her child when coming forth did not break through the enclosure of her virginal purity. Therefore it is possible for two bodies to be <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> together in the same place.

<p>Further, this may again be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> went in to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, the doors being shut (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse19">John 20:19-26</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As shown above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) the reason why two bodies must needs be in two places is that distinction in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> requires distinction in place. Wherefore we observe that when two bodies merge into one, each loses its distinct being, and one indistinct being accrues to the two combined, as in the case of mixtures. Hence it is impossible for two bodies to remain two and yet be together unless each retain its distinct being which it had hitherto, in so much as each of them was a being undivided in itself and distinct from others. Now this distinct being depends on the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> principles of a thing as on its proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, but on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as on the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And since the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can preserve a thing in being, though the second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> be done away, as appears from the first proposition of De Causis, therefore by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power and by that alone it is possible for an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> to be without <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> as in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the Altar</a>. Likewise by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by that alone, it is possible for a body to retain its distinct being from that of another body, although its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> be not distinct as to place from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the other body: and thus it is possible by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> for two bodies to be together in the same place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument is sophistical because it is based on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> supposition, or begs the question. For it supposes the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, between two opposite superficies of a place, of a dimension proper to the place, with which dimension a dimension of the body put in occupation of the place would have to be identified: because it would then follow that the dimensions of two bodies occupying a place would become one dimension, if each of them were identified with the dimension of the place. But this supposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because if it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> whenever a body acquires a new place, it would follow that a change takes place in the dimensions of the place or of thing placed: since it is impossible for two things to become one anew, except one of them be changed. Whereas if, as is the case in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, no other dimensions belong to a place than those of the thing occupying the place, it is clear that the argument proves nothing, but begs the question, because according to this nothing else has been said, but that the dimensions of a thing placed are the same as the dimensions of the place; excepting that the dimensions of the thing placed are contained within the bounds of the place, and that the distance between the bounds of a place is commensurate with the distance between the bounds of the thing placed, just as the former would be distant by their own dimensions if they had them. Thus that the dimensions of two bodies be the dimensions of one place is nothing else than that two bodies be in the same place, which is the chief question at issue.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Granted that by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> two bodies be together in the same place, nothing follows either against common principles, or against the definition of a line, or against any conclusions of geometry. For, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> differs from all other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> in that it has a special reason of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a> and distinction, namely on account of the placing of the parts, besides the reason of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a> and distinction which is common to it and all other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, arising namely from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which is its subject. Thus then one line may be understood as being distinct from another, either because it is in another subject (in which case we are considering a material line), or because it is placed at a distance from another (in which case we are considering a mathematical line, which is understood apart from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>). Accordingly if we remove <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, there can be no distinction between lines save in respect of a different placing: and in like manner neither can there be a distinction of points, nor of superficies, nor of any dimensions whatever. Consequently geometry cannot suppose one line to be added to another, as being distinct therefrom unless it be distinct as to place. But supposing by a Divine <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> a distinction of subject without a distinction of place, we can understand a distinction of lines; and these are not distant from one another in place, on account of the distinction of subjects. Again we can understand a difference of points, and thus different lines described on two bodies that are in the same place are drawn from different points to different points; for the point that we take is not a point fixed in the place, but in the placed body, because a line is not said to be drawn otherwise than from a point which is its term. In like manner the two circles described in two spherical bodies that occupy the same place are two, not on account of the difference of place, else they could not touch one another as a whole, but on account of the distinction of subjects, and thus while wholly touching one another they still remain two. Even so a circle described by a placed spherical body touches, as a whole, the other circle described by the locating body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could make a body not to be in a place; and yet supposing this, it would not follow that a certain body is not in a place, because the greater body is the place of the lesser body, by reason of its superficies which is described by contact with the terms of the lesser body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It is impossible for one body to be <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> in two places locally (for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not locally on the altar), although it is possible by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> for two bodies to be in the same place. Because to be in several places at once is incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, by reason of its having being undivided in itself, for it would follow that it is divided as to place. on the other hand, to be in the same place with another body is incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> as distinct from aught else. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of unity is perfected in indivision (Metaph. v), whereas distinction from others is a result of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of unity. Wherefore that one same body be locally in several places at once implies a contradiction, even as for a man to lack reason, while for two bodies to be in the same place does not imply a contradiction, as explained above. Hence the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether one glorified body can be in the same place together with another glorified body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a glorified body can be in the same place together with another glorified body. Because where there is greater subtlety there is less resistance. If then a glorified body is more subtle than a non-glorified body, it will offer less resistance to a glorified body: and so if a glorified body can be in the same place with a non-glorified body, much more can it with a glorified body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, even as a glorified body will be more subtle than a non-glorified body, so will one glorified body be more subtle than another. Therefore if a glorified body can be in the same place with a non-glorified body, a more subtle glorified body can be in the same place with a less subtle glorified body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the body of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is subtle, and will then be glorified. Now the glorified body of a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> will be able to be in the same place with the body of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be able at will to travel to and from earth. Therefore two glorified bodies will be able to occupy the same place.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The glorified bodies will be <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, that is like spirits in a certain respect. Now two spirits cannot be in the same place, although a body and a spirit can be in the same place, as stated above (Sent. i, D, 37, 3, 3; I, 52, 3). Therefore neither will two glorified bodies be able to be in the same place.

<p>Further, if two bodies occupy the same place, one is penetrated by the other. But to be penetrated is a mark of imperfection which will be altogether absent from the glorified bodies. Therefore it will be impossible for two glorified bodies to be in the same place.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The property of a glorified body does not make it able to be in the same place with another glorified body, nor again to be in the same place with a non-glorified body. But it would be possible by the Divine power for two glorified bodies or two non-glorified bodies to be in the same place, even as a glorified body with a non-glorified body. Nevertheless it is not befitting for a glorified body to be in the same place with another glorified body, both because a becoming order will be observed in them, which demands distinction, and because one glorified body will not be in the way of another. Consequently two glorified bodies will never be in the same place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument supposes that a glorified body is able by reason of its subtlety to be in the same place with another body: and this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p>The same answer applies to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The body of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the other bodies will be said equivocally to be glorified, in so far as they will have a certain share in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and not as though it were becoming for them to have the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of glorified <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether by virtue of its subtlety a glorified body will no longer need to be in an equal place?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that by virtue of its subtlety, a glorified body will no longer need to be in an equal place. For the glorified bodies will be made like to the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not bound by this <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of being in an equal place: wherefore it is contained whole under the small or great dimensions of a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> host. Therefore the same will be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the glorified bodies.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. iv, 6), that two bodies are not in the same place, because it would follow that the greatest body would occupy the smallest place, since its various parts could be in the same part of the place: for it makes no difference whether two bodies or however many be in the same place. Now a glorified body will be in the same place with another body, as is commonly admitted. Therefore it will be possible for it to be in any place however small.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, even as a body is seen by reason of its color, so is it measured by reason of its <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Now the glorified body will be so subject to the spirit that it will be able at will to be seen, and not seen, especially by a non-glorified eye, as evidenced in the case of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore its <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> will be so subject to the spirit's will that it will be able to be in a little or great place, and to have a little or great <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> at will.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. iv, text. 30) that "whatever is in a place occupies a place equal to itself." Now the glorified body will be in a place. Therefore it will occupy a place equal to itself.

<p>Further, the dimensions of a place and of that which is in that place are the same, as shown in Phys. iv, text. 30,76,77. Therefore if the place were larger than that which is in the place the same thing would be greater and smaller than itself, which is absurd.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A body is not related to place save through the medium of its proper dimensions, in respect of which a located body is confined through contact with the locating body. Hence it is not possible for a body to occupy a place smaller than its <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, unless its proper <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> be made in some way less than itself: and this can only be understood in two ways. First, by a variation in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in respect of the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so that in fact the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which at first is subject to a greater <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is afterwards subject to a lesser. Some have held this to be the case with the glorified bodies, saying that <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is subject to them at will, so that when they list, they are able to have a great <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, and when they list a small <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But this is impossible, because no movement affecting that which is intrinsic to a thing is possible without passion to the detriment [Cf. I-II, 22, 1; I-II, 41, 1] of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Hence in incorruptible, i.e. heavenly, bodies, there is only local movement, which is not according to something intrinsic. Thus it is clear that change of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in respect of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> would be incompatible with the impassibility and incorruptibility of a glorified body. Moreover, it would follow that a glorified body would be sometimes rarer and sometimes denser, because since it cannot be deprived of any of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, sometimes the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> would be under great dimensions and sometimes under small dimensions, and thus it would be rarefied and densified, which is impossible. Secondly, that the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of a glorified body become smaller than itself may be understood by a variation of place; so, to wit, that the parts of a glorified body insinuate themselves into one another, so that it is reduced in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> however small it may become. And some have held this to be the case, saying that by reason of its subtlety a glorified body will be able to be in the same place with a non-glorified body: and that in like manner its parts can be one within the other, so much so that a whole glorified body will be able to pass through the minutest opening in another body: and thus they explain how <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body came out of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin's</a> womb; and how it went into His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, the doors being shut. But this is impossible; both because the glorified body will not be able, by reason of its subtlety, to be in the same place with another body, and because, even if it were able to be in the same place with another body, this would not be possible if the other were a glorified body, as many say; and again because this would be inconsistent with the right disposition of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, which requires the parts to be in a certain fixed place and at a certain fixed distance from one another. Wherefore this will never happen, not even by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. Consequently we must say that the glorified body will always be in a place equal to itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not locally in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the Altar</a>, as stated above (Sent. iv, D, 10, 1, 1, ad 5; III, 77, 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher's</a> argument is that for the same reason one part might permeate another. But this permeation of the parts of a glorified body into one another is impossible, as stated above. Therefore the objection does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A body is seen because it acts on the sight: but that it does or does not act on the sight <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> no change in the body. Hence it is not unfitting, if it can be seen when it will, and not seen when it will [Cf. III, 55, 4]. On the other hand, being in a place is not an action proceeding from a body by reason of its <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as being seen is by reason of its color. Consequently the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the glorified body, by reason of its subtlety, will be impalpable?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the glorified body, by reason of its subtlety, is impalpable. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxv in Evang.): "What is palpable must needs be corruptible." But the glorified body is incorruptible. Therefore it is impalpable.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is palpable resists one who handles it. But that which can be in the same place with another does not resist it. Since then a glorified body can be in the same place with another body, it will not be palpable.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every palpable body is tangible. Now every tangible body has tangible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> in excess of the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the one touching it. Since then in the glorified bodies the tangible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> are not in excess but are reduced to a supreme degree of equality, it would seem that they are impalpable.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> rose again with a glorified body; and yet His body was palpable, as appears from <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke 24:39</a>: "Handle, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones." Therefore the glorified bodies also will be palpable.

<p>Further, this is the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/05638b.htm">Eutychius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states (Moral. xxiv): for he said that in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> our bodies will be impalpable.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every palpable body is tangible, but not conversely. For every body is tangible that has <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> whereby the sense of touch has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to be affected: wherefore air, fire, and the like are tangible bodies: but a palpable body, in addition to this, resists the touch; wherefore the air which never resists that which passes through it, and is most easily pierced, is tangible indeed but not palpable. Accordingly it is clear that a body is said to be palpable for two reasons, namely on account of its tangible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, and on account of its resisting that which touches it, so as to hinder it from piercing it. And since the tangible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> are hot and cold and so forth, which are not found save in heavy and light bodies, which through being contrary to one another are therefore corruptible, it follows that the heavenly bodies, which by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are incorruptible, are sensible to the sight but not tangible, and therefore neither are they palpable. This is what <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> means when he says (Hom. xxv in Evang.) that "whatever is palpable must needs be corruptible." Accordingly the glorified body has by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> those <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> which have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to affect the touch, and yet since the body is altogether subject to the spirit, it is in its power thereby to affect or not to affect the touch. In like manner it is competent by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to resist any other passing body, so that the latter cannot be in the same place together with it: although, according to its pleasure, it may happen by the Divine power that it occupy the same place with another body, and thus offer no resistance to a passing body. Wherefore according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the glorified body is palpable, but it is competent for it to be impalpable to a non-glorified body by a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> power. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxv in Evang.) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> offered His flesh to be handled, which He had brought in through the closed doors, so as to afford a complete <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> His body was unchanged in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> though changed in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The incorruptibility of a glorified body does not result from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its component parts; and it is on account of that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that whatever is palpable is corruptible, as stated above. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although in a way it is possible for a glorified body to be in the same place with another body: nevertheless the glorified body has it in its power to resist at will any one touching it, and thus it is palpable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the glorified bodies the tangible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> are not reduced to the real mean that is measured according to equal distance from the extremes, but to the proportionate mean, according as is most becoming to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> complexion in each part. Wherefore the touch of those bodies will be most delightful, because a power always delights in a becoming object, and is grieved by excess.
