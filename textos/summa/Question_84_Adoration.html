<h1>Question 84. Adoration</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3084.htm#article1"> Is adoration an act of latria?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3084.htm#article2"> Does adoration denote an internal or an external act?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3084.htm#article3"> Does adoration require a definite place?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether adoration is an act of latria or religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that adoration is not an act of latria or religion. The worship of religion is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. But adoration is not due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone: since we read (<a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse2">Genesis 18:2</a>) that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and (<a href="../bible/1ki001.htm#verse23">1 Kings 1:23</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Nathan, when he was come in to king David, "worshiped him bowing down to the ground." Therefore adoration is not an act of religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the worship of religion is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the object of beatitude, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei x, 3): whereas adoration is due to Him by reason of His majesty, since a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa028.htm#verse2">Psalm 28:2</a>, "Adore ye the Lord in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> court," says: "We pass from these courts into the court where we <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> His majesty." Therefore adoration is not an act of <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the worship of one same religion is due to the three Persons. But we do not <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the three Persons with one adoration, for we genuflect at each separate invocation of Them [At the adoration of the Cross, on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>]. Therefore adoration is not an act of <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> are the words quoted <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse10">Matthew 4:10</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shalt thou <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> and Him only shalt thou serve."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Adoration is directed to the reverence of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>. Now it is evident from what we have said (81, 2,4) that it is proper to religion to show reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence the adoration whereby we <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an act of religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Reverence is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on account of His excellence, which is communicated to certain creatures not in equal measure, but according to a measure of proportion; and so the reverence which we pay to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which belongs to latria, differs from the reverence which we pay to certain excellent creatures; this belongs to dulia, and we shall speak of it further on (103). And since external actions are signs of internal reverence, certain external tokens significative of reverence are offered to creatures of excellence, and among these tokens the chief is adoration: yet there is one thing which is offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, and that is sacrifice. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x, 4): "Many tokens of Divine worship are employed in doing <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, either through excessive <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, or through pernicious flattery; yet so that those to whom these honors are given are recognized as being men to whom we owe esteem and reverence and even adoration if they be far above us. But who ever thought it his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to sacrifice to any other than one whom he either <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> or deemed or pretended to be a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?" Accordingly it was with the reverence due to an excellent creature that Nathan <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> David; while it was the reverence due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with which Mardochai refused to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Aman fearing "lest he should transfer the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to a man" (<a href="../bible/est013.htm#verse14">Esther 13:14</a>).

<p>Again with the reverence due to an excellent creature <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as did also <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a> (<a href="../bible/jos005.htm#verse15">Joshua 5:15</a>): though we may understand them to have <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>, with the adoration of latria, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who appeared and spoke to them in the guise of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. It was with the reverence due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that John was forbidden to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> (<a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse9">Apocalypse 22:9</a>), both to indicate the dignity which he had acquired through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made equal to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: wherefore the same text goes on: "I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren"; as also to exclude any occasion of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, wherefore the text continues: "Adore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Every Divine excellency is included in His majesty: to which it pertains that we should be made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in Him as in the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since there is one excellence of the three Divine Persons, one <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and reverence is due to them and consequently one adoration. It is to represent this that where it is related (<a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse2">Genesis 18:2</a>) that three men appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, we are told that he addressed one, saying: "Lord, if I have found favor in thy sight," etc. The triple genuflection represents the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of Persons, not a difference of adoration.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether adoration denotes an action of the body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that adoration does not denote an act of the body. It is written (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse23">John 4:23</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> adorers shall <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the Father in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now what is done in spirit has nothing to do with an act of the body. Therefore adoration does not denote an act of the body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the word adoration is taken from "oratio" [<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>]. But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> consists chiefly in an interior act, according to <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>, "I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with the spirit, I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> also with the understanding." Therefore adoration denotes chiefly a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> act.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, acts of the body pertain to sensible <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: whereas we approach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not by bodily but by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense. Therefore adoration does not denote an act of the body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse5">Exodus 20:5</a>, "Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> them, nor serve them," says: "Thou shalt neither worship them in mind, nor <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> them outwardly."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv, 12), since we are composed of a twofold <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and sensible, we offer <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a twofold adoration; namely, a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> adoration, consisting in the internal devotion of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; and a bodily adoration, which consists in an exterior humbling of the body. And since in all acts of latria that which is without is referred to that which is within as being of greater import, it follows that exterior adoration is offered on account of interior adoration, in other words we exhibit signs of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> in our bodies in order to incite our affections to submit to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it is connatural to us to proceed from the sensible to the intelligible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even bodily adoration is done in spirit, in so far as it proceeds from and is directed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> devotion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is primarily in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and secondarily expressed in words, as stated above (Question 83, Article 12), so too adoration consists chiefly in an interior reverence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but secondarily in certain bodily signs of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>; thus when we genuflect we signify our weakness in comparison with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and when we prostrate ourselves we profess that we are nothing of ourselves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Though we cannot reach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the senses, our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is urged by sensible signs to approach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether adoration requires a definite place?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that adoration does not require a definite place. It is written (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse21">John 4:21</a>): "The hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the Father"; and the same reason seems to apply to other places. Therefore a definite place is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for adoration.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, exterior adoration is directed to interior adoration.

<p>But interior adoration is shown to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> everywhere. Therefore exterior adoration does not require a definite place.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> in the New as in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Now in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> towards the west, because the door of the Tabernacle looked to the east (<a href="../bible/exo026.htm#verse18">Exodus 26:18 seqq.</a>). Therefore for the same reason we ought now to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> towards the west, if any definite place be requisite for adoration.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa056.htm#verse7">Isaiah 56:7</a>): "My house shall be called the house of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>," which words are also quoted (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse16">John 2:16</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the chief part of adoration is the internal devotion of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, while the secondary part is something external pertaining to bodily signs. Now the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> internally apprehends <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as not comprised in a place; while bodily signs must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be in some definite place and position. Hence a definite place is required for adoration, not chiefly, as though it were <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> thereto, but by reason of a certain fittingness, like other bodily signs.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By these words <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> foretold the cessation of adoration, both according to the rite of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> who <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> in Jerusalem, and according to the rite of the Samaritans who <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> on Mount Garizim. For both these rites ceased with the advent of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Gospel, according to which "a sacrifice is offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in every place," as stated in <a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse11">Malachi 1:11</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A definite place is chosen for adoration, not on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>, as though He were enclosed in a place, but on account of the adorers; and this for three reasons. First, because the place is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, so that those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> there conceive a greater devotion and are more likely to be heard, as may be seen in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Solomon (<a href="../bible/1ki008.htm">1 Kings 8</a>). Secondly, on account of the sacred mysteries and other signs of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> contained therein. Thirdly, on account of the concourse of many adorers, by reason of which their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is more likely to be heard, according to <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse20">Matthew 18:20</a>, "Where there are two or three gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is a certain fittingness in <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoring</a> towards the east. First, because the Divine majesty is indicated in the movement of the heavens which is from the east. Secondly, because Paradise was situated in the east according to the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint version</a> of <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse8">Genesis 2:8</a>, and so we signify our desire to return to Paradise. Thirdly, on account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who is "the light of the world" [<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse12">John 8:12</a>; <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse5">9:5</a>, and is called "the Orient" (<a href="../bible/zec006.htm#verse12">Zechariah 6:12</a>). Who mounteth above the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> of heavens to the east (<a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse34">Psalm 67:34</a>), and is expected to come from the east, according to <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse27">Matthew 24:27</a>, "As lightning cometh out of the east, and appeareth even into the west; so shall also the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> be."
