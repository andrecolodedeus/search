<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the soul knows bodies through the intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> bodies through the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Soliloq. ii, 4) that "bodies cannot be understood by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; nor indeed anything corporeal unless it can be perceived by the senses." He says also (Gen. ad lit. xii, 24) that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision is of those things that are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But such are not bodies. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> bodies through the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as sense is to the intelligible, so is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the sensible. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can by no means, through the senses, understand <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, which are intelligible. Therefore by no means can it, through the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> bodies, which are sensible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is concerned with things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and unchangeable. But all bodies are mobile and changeable. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> bodies through the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Science is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> bodies, it follows that there is no science of bodies; and thus perishes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> science, which treats of mobile bodies.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It should be said in order to elucidate this question, that the early <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who inquired into the natures of things, thought there was nothing in the world save bodies. And because they observed that all bodies are mobile, and considered them to be ever in a state of flux, they were of opinion that we can have no certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things. For what is in a continual state of flux, cannot be grasped with any degree of <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a>, for it passes away ere the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> can form a judgment thereon: according to the saying of Heraclitus, that "it is not possible twice to touch a drop of water in a passing torrent," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> relates (Metaph. iv, Did. iii, 5).

<p>After these came <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who, wishing to save the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, maintained that, besides these things corporeal, there is another genus of beings, separate from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and movement, which beings he called "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>" or "<a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>," by participation of which each one of these singular and sensible things is said to be either a man, or a horse, or the like. Wherefore he said that <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and definitions, and whatever appertains to the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, are not referred to these sensible bodies, but to those beings immaterial and separate: so that according to this the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not understand these corporeal things, but the separate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> thereof.

<p>Now this may be shown to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> for two reasons.

<p>First, because, since those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are immaterial and immovable, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of movement and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> would be excluded from science (which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is proper to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> science), and likewise all demonstration through moving and material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p>Secondly, because it seems ridiculous, when we seek for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things which are to us manifest, to introduce other beings, which cannot be the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of those others, since they differ from them <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>: so that granted that we have a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, we cannot for that reason claim to form a judgment concerning these sensible things.

<p>Now it seems that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> strayed from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> because, having observed that all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> takes place through some kind of similitude, he thought that the form of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be in the knower in the same manner as in the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Then he observed that the form of the thing understood is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> under <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of universality, immateriality, and immobility: which is apparent from the very operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whose act of understanding has a universal extension, and is subject to a certain amount of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>: for the mode of action corresponds to the mode of the agent's form. Wherefore he concluded that the things which we understand must have in themselves an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> under the same <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of immateriality and immobility.

<p>But there is no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for this. For even in sensible things it is to be observed that the form is otherwise in one sensible than in another: for instance, whiteness may be of great intensity in one, and of a less intensity in another: in one we find whiteness with sweetness, in another without sweetness. In the same way the sensible form is conditioned differently in the thing which is external to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and in the senses which receive the forms of sensible things without receiving <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, such as the color of gold without receiving gold. So also the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, according to its own mode, receives under <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of immateriality and immobility, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of material and mobile bodies: for the received is in the receiver according to the mode of the receiver. We must conclude, therefore, that through the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> bodies by a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is immaterial, universal, and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> are to be understood as referring to the medium of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and not to its object. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> bodies by understanding them, not indeed through bodies, nor through material and corporeal <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; but through immaterial and intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which can be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by their own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxii, 29), it is not correct to say that as the sense <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only bodies so the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things; for it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> would not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> corporeal things. The reason of this diversity is that the lower power does not extend to those things that belong to the higher power; whereas the higher power operates in a more excellent manner those things which belong to the lower power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every movement presupposes something immovable: for when a change of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> occurs, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> remains unmoved; and when there is a change of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> remains unmoved. Moreover the various <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of mutable things are themselves immovable; for instance, though <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> be not always sitting, yet it is an immovable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that whenever he does sit he remains in one place. For this reason there is nothing to hinder our having an immovable science of movable things.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the soul understands corporeal things through its essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands corporeal things through its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 5) that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> "collects and lays hold of the images of bodies which are formed in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for in forming them it gives them something of its own <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands bodies by images of bodies. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> bodies through its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which it employs for the formation of such images, and from which it forms them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 8) that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, after a fashion, is everything." Since, therefore, like is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by like, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> corporeal things through itself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is superior to corporeal creatures. Now lower things are in higher things in a more eminent way than in themselves, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. xii). Therefore all corporeal creatures <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in a more excellent way in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than in themselves. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> corporeal creatures through its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ix, 3) that "the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> gathers <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of corporeal things through the bodily senses." But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through the bodily senses. Therefore it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> corporeal things through itself.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> held that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> bodies through its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For it was universally admitted that "like is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by like." But they thought that the form of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in the knower in the same mode as in the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> however were of a contrary opinion. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, having observed that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has an immaterial <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and an immaterial mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, held that the forms of things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> subsist immaterially. While the earlier <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, observing that things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> are corporeal and material, held that things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> must <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> materially even in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them. And therefore, in order to ascribe to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things, they held that it has the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in common with all. And because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a result is determined by its principles, they ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a principle; so that those who thought fire to be the principle of all, held that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of fire; and in like manner as to air and water. Lastly, Empedocles, who held the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of our four material elements and two principles of movement, said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was composed of these. Consequently, since they held that things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> materially, they maintained that all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is material, thus failing to discern <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from sense.

<p>But this opinion will not hold. First, because in the material principle of which they spoke, the various results do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> save in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. But a thing is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> according as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, but only according as it is in act, as is shown Metaph. ix (Did. viii, 9): wherefore neither is a power <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> except through its act. It is therefore insufficient to ascribe to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the principles in order to explain the fact that it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all, unless we further admit in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> natures and forms of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> result, for instance, of bone, flesh, and the like; thus does <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> argue against Empedocles (De Anima i, 5). Secondly, because if it were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> materially in the knower, there would be no reason why things which have a material <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should be devoid of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; why, for instance, if by fire the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> fire, that fire also which is outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should not have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of fire.

<p>We must conclude, therefore, that material things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> must needs <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the knower, not materially, but immaterially. The reason of this is, because the act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> extends to things outside the knower: for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things even that are external to us. Now by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> the form of a thing is determined to some one thing. Wherefore it is clear that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is in inverse ratio of materiality. And consequently things that are not receptive of forms save materially, have no power of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whatever--such as plants, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 12). But the more immaterially a thing receives the form of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the more perfect is its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which abstracts the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> not only from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but also from the individuating <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, has more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than the senses, which receive the form of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> indeed, but subject to material <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. Moreover, among the senses, sight has the most perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, because it is the least material, as we have remarked above (Question 78, Article 3): while among <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> the more perfect is the more immaterial.

<p>It is therefore clear from the foregoing, that if there be an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, then its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> must needs have all things in itself immaterially; thus the early <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> held that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that it may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, must be actually composed of the principles of all material things. Now this is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that His Essence comprise all things immaterially as effects pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> virtually in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, therefore, understands all things through His Essence: but neither the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can do so.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in that passage is speaking of an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, which takes place through the image of bodies. To the formation of such images the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> gives part of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, just as a subject is given in order to be informed by some form. In this way the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> makes such images from itself; not that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or some part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be turned into this or that image; but just as we say that a body is made into something colored because of its being informed with color. That this is the sense, is clear from what follows. For he says that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> "keeps something"--namely, not informed with such image--"which is able freely to judge of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of these images": and that this is the "mind" or "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>." And he says that the part which is informed with these images--namely, the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>--is "common to us and beasts."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> did not hold that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is actually composed of all things, as did the earlier <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; he said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is all things, "after a fashion," forasmuch as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to all--through the senses, to all things sensible--through the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, to all things intelligible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every creature has a finite and determinate <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Wherefore although the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the higher creature has a certain likeness to the lower creature, forasmuch as they have something in common generically, yet it has not a complete likeness thereof, because it is determined to a certain <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> other than the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the lower creature. But the Divine Essence is a perfect likeness of all, whatsoever may be found to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, being the universal principle of all.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the soul understands all things through innate species?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands all things through innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says, in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> for the Ascension (xxix in Ev.), that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has understanding in common with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> understand all things through innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: wherefore in the book De Causis it is said that "every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is full of forms." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also has innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things, by means of which it understands corporeal things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more excellent than corporeal primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> under the forms to which it has <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Therefore much more is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> under intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. And so the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands corporeal things through innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one can answer the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> except concerning what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. But even a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> untaught and devoid of acquired <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, answers the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to every question if put to him in orderly fashion, as we find related in the Meno (xv seqq.) of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, concerning a certain <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Therefore we have some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things even before we acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; which would not be the case unless we had innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands corporeal things through innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, speaking of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, says (De Anima iii, 4) that it is like "a tablet on which nothing is written."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since form is the principle of action, a thing must be related to the form which is the principle of an action, as it is to that action: for instance, if upward motion is from lightness, then that which only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> moves upwards must needs be only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> light, but that which actually moves upwards must needs be actually light. Now we observe that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sometimes is only a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> knower, both as to sense and as to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And he is reduced from such <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act--through the action of sensible objects on his senses, to the act of sensation--by instruction or discovery, to the act of understanding. Wherefore we must say that the cognitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> both to the images which are the principles of sensing, and to those which are the principles of understanding. For this reason <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Anima iii, 4) held that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands has no innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but is at first in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to all such <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>But since that which has a form actually, is sometimes unable to act according to that form on account of some hindrance, as a light thing may be hindered from moving upwards; for this reason did <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> hold that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is filled with all intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but that, by being united to the body, it is hindered from the realization of its act. But this seems to be unreasonable.

<p>First, because, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things, it seems impossible for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> so far to forget the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself to be possessed thereof: for no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> forgets what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>; that, for instance, the whole is larger than the part, and such like. And especially unreasonable does this seem if we suppose that it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be united to the body, as we have established above (76, 1): for it is unreasonable that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> operation of a thing be totally hindered by that which belongs to it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>.

<p>Secondly, the falseness of this opinion is clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the fact that if a sense be wanting, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is apprehended through that sense is wanting also: for instance, a man who is born blind can have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of colors. This would not be the case if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had innate images of all intelligible things. We must therefore conclude that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> corporeal things through innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Man indeed has <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> in common with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but not in the same degree of perfection: just as the lower grades of bodies, which merely <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Homily on Ascension, xxix In Ev.), have not the same degree of perfection as the higher bodies. For the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the lower bodies is not totally completed by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to forms which it has not: whereas the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of heavenly bodies is totally completed by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, so that it is not in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to any other form, as we have said above (Question 66, Article 2). In the same way the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is perfected by intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, in accordance with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; whereas the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to such <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> has <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being through its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, consequently it had need to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> under some form: else it would not be in act. But when once it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> under one form it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to others. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not receive <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being through the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and therefore there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If questions be put in an orderly fashion they proceed from universal self-evident principles to what is particular. Now by such a process <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is produced in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the learner. Wherefore when he answers the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to a subsequent question, this is not because he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> previously, but because he thus learns for the first time. For it matters not whether the teacher proceed from universal principles to conclusions by questioning or by asserting; for in either case the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the listener is assured of what follows by that which preceded.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the intelligible species are derived by the soul from certain separate forms?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are derived by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from some separate forms. For whatever is such by participation is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by what is such <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>; for instance, that which is on fire is reduced to fire as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> forasmuch as it is actually understanding, participates the thing understood: for, in a way, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act is the thing understood in act. Therefore what in itself and in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is understood in act, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> actually understands. Now that which in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is actually understood is a form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands, are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by some separate forms.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the intelligible is to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as the sensible is to the sense. But the sensible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which are in the senses, and by which we sense, are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the sensible object which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> actually outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, by which our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands, are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by some things actually intelligible, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But these can be nothing else than forms separate from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore the intelligible forms of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are derived from some separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is reduced to act by something actual. If, therefore, our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, previously in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, afterwards actually understands, this must needs be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by some <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which is always in act. But this is a separate <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, by which we actually understand, are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by some separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If this were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> we should not need the senses in order to understand. And this is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> especially from the fact that if a man be wanting in a sense, he cannot have any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the sensibles corresponding to that sense.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have held that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are derived from certain separate forms or <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. And this in two ways. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, as we have said (1), held that the forms of sensible things subsist by themselves without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; for instance, the form of a man which he called "per se" <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the form or <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a horse which is called "per se" horse, and so forth. He said therefore that these forms are participated both by our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and by corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; by our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to the effect of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> thereof, and by corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to the effect of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>: so that, just as corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by participating the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a stone, becomes an individuating stone, so our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by participating the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a stone, is made to understand a stone. Now participation of an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> takes place by some image of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in the participator, just as a model is participated by a copy. So just as he held that the sensible forms, which are in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, are derived from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> as certain images thereof: so he held that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are images of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, derived therefrom. And for this reason, as we have said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), he referred <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and definitions to those <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<p>But since it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of sensible things that their forms should subsist without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> proves in many ways (Metaph. vi), <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> (De Anima v) setting this opinion aside, held that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of all sensible things, instead of subsisting in themselves without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> immaterially in the separate <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>: from the first of which, said he, such <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are derived by a second, and so on to the last separate <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which he called the "active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>," from which, according to him, intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> flow into our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and sensible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> into corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. And so <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> agrees with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in this, that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are derived from certain separate forms; but these <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> held to subsist of themselves, while <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> placed them in the "active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>." They differ, too, in this respect, that <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> held that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> do not remain in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> after it has ceased actually to understand, and that it needs to turn (to the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>) in order to receive them anew. Consequently he does not hold that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has innate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who held that the participated <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> remain immovably in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>But in this opinion no sufficient reason can be assigned for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being united to the body. For it cannot be said that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body for the sake of the body: for neither is form for the sake of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, nor is the mover for the sake of the moved, but rather the reverse. Especially does the body seem <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for the latter's proper operation which is to understand: since as to its being the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not depend on the body. But if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> had an inborn aptitude for receiving intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> through the influence of only certain separate principles, and were not to receive them from the senses, it would not need the body in order to understand: wherefore to no purpose would it be united to the body.

<p>But if it be said that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> needs the senses in order to understand, through being in some way awakened by them to the consideration of those things, the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of which it receives from the separate principles: even this seems an insufficient explanation. For this awakening does not seem <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, except in as far as it is overcome by sluggishness, as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> expressed it, and by forgetfulness, through its union with the body: and thus the senses would be of no use to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> except for the purpose of removing the obstacle which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> encounters through its union with the body. Consequently the reason of the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the body still remains to be sought.

<p>And if it be said with <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>, that the senses are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because by them it is aroused to turn to the "active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>" from which it receives the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: neither is this a sufficient explanation. Because if it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to understand through <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> derived from the "active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>," it follows that at times the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> wanting in one of the senses can turn to the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, either from the inclination of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or through being roused by another sense, to the effect of receiving the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of which the corresponding sensible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are wanting. And thus a man born blind could have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of colors; which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. We must therefore conclude that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, by which our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands, are not derived from separate forms.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which are participated by our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are reduced, as to their first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, to a first principle which is by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> intelligible--namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But they proceed from that principle by means of the sensible forms and material things, from which we gather <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Material things, as to the being which they have outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, may be actually sensible, but not actually intelligible. Wherefore there is no comparison between sense and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Our passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is reduced from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act by some being in act, that is, by the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as we have said (79, 4); and not by a separate <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, as proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, although perchance as remote <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the intellectual soul knows material things in the eternal types?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> material things in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types. For that in which anything is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> must itself be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> more and previously. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in the present state of life, does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types: for it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Whom the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, but is "united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to the unknown," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Myst. Theolog. i). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>) that "the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are clearly seen . . . by the things that are made." But among the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through creatures and not the converse.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types are nothing else but <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 46) that "<a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are permanent types <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the Divine mind." If therefore we say that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types, we come back to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> who said that all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is derived from them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. xii, 25): "If we both see that what you say is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and if we both see that what I say is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, where do we see this, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>? Neither do I see it in you, nor do you see it in me: but we both see it in the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is above our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>." Now the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is contained in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 11): "If those who are called <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> said by chance anything that was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and consistent with our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we must claim it from them as from <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> possessors. For some of the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> are spurious imitations or <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> inventions, which we must be careful to avoid when we renounce the society of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>." Consequently whenever <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, who was imbued with the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, found in their teaching anything consistent with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he adopted it: and those thing which he found contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he amended. Now <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> held, as we have said above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), that the forms of things subsist of themselves apart from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and these he called <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, by participation of which he said that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things: so that just as corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by participating the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a stone becomes a stone, so our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by participating the same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a stone. But since it seems contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that forms of things themselves, outside the things themselves and apart from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> held, asserting that "per se" life or "per se" wisdom are creative <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> relates (Div. Nom. xi); therefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (QQ. 83, qu. 46), for the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> defended by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, substituted the types of all creatures <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the Divine mind, according to which types all things are made in themselves, and are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>When, therefore, the question is asked: Does the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types? we must reply that one thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in another in two ways.

<p>First, as in an object itself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; as one may see in a mirror the images of things reflected therein. In this way the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in the present state of life, cannot see all things in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types; but the blessed who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and all things in Him, thus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types.

<p>Secondly, on thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in another as in a principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: thus we might say that we see in the sun what we see by the sun. And thus we must needs say that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types, since by participation of these types we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light itself which is in us, is nothing else than a participated likeness of the uncreated light, in which are contained the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types. Whence it is written (<a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse6">Psalm 4:6-7</a>), "Many say: Who showeth us <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things?" which question the Psalmist answers, "The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us," as though he were to say: By the seal of the Divine light in us, all things are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us.

<p>But since besides the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light which is in us, intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which are derived from things, are required in order for us to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of material things; therefore this same <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not due merely to a participation of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types, as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> held, maintaining that the mere participation of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> sufficed for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 16): "Although the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> by convincing arguments that all things occur in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types, were they able to see in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types, or to find out from them how many kinds of animals there are and the origin of each? Did they not seek for this information from the story of times and places?"

<p>But that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> did not understand all things to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in their "<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types" or in the "unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," as though the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types themselves were seen, is clear from what he says (QQ. 83, qu. 46)--viz. that "not each and every rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can be said to be worthy of that vision," namely, of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types, "but only those that are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and pure," such as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed.

<p>From what has been said the objections are easily solved.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether intellectual knowledge is derived from sensible things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not derived from sensible things. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 9) that "we cannot expect to learn the fulness of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the senses of the body." This he proves in two ways.

<p>First, because "whatever the bodily senses reach, is continually being changed; and what is never the same cannot be perceived."

<p>Secondly, because, "whatever we perceive by the body, even when not present to the senses, may be present to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, as when we are asleep or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: yet we cannot discern by the senses, whether what we perceive be the sensible object or the deceptive image thereof. Now nothing can be perceived which cannot be distinguished from its counterfeit." And so he concludes that we cannot expect to learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the senses. But <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> apprehends the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> cannot be conveyed by the senses.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16): "We must not thing that the body can make any impression on the spirit, as though the spirit were to supply the place of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in regard to the body's action; for that which acts is in every way more excellent than that which it acts on." Whence he concludes that "the body does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> its image in the spirit, but the spirit <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> it in itself." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not derived from sensible things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an effect does not surpass the power of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> extends beyond sensible things: for we understand some things which cannot be perceived by the senses. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not derived from sensible things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. i, 1; Poster. ii, 15) that the principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is in the senses.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> On this point the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> held three opinions. For Democritus held that "all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by images issuing from the bodies we think of and entering into our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his letter to Dioscorus (cxviii, 4). And <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (De Somn. et Vigil.) that Democritus held that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by a "discharge of images." And the reason for this opinion was that both Democritus and the other early <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> did not distinguish between <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and sense, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> relates (De Anima iii, 3). Consequently, since the sense is affected by the sensible, they thought that all our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is affected by this mere impression brought about by sensible things. Which impression Democritus held to be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a discharge of images.

<p><a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, on the other hand, held that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is distinct from the senses: and that it is an immaterial power not making use of a corporeal organ for its action. And since the incorporeal cannot be affected by the corporeal, he held that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not brought about by sensible things affecting the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but by separate intelligible forms being participated by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as we have said above (4,5). Moreover he held that sense is a power operating of itself. Consequently neither is sense, since it is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power, affected by the sensible: but the sensible organs are affected by the sensible, the result being that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in a way roused to form within itself the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the sensible. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> seems to touch on this opinion (Gen. ad lit. xii, 24) where he says that the "body feels not, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through the body, which it makes use of as a kind of messenger, for reproducing within itself what is announced from without." Thus according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, neither does <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> proceed from sensible <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, nor sensible <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> exclusively from sensible things; but these rouse the sensible <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the sentient act, while the senses rouse the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the act of understanding.

<p><a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> chose a middle course. For with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> he agreed that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and sense are different. But he held that the sense has not its proper operation without the cooperation of the body; so that to feel is not an act of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, but of the "composite." And he held the same in regard to all the operations of the sensitive part. Since, therefore, it is not unreasonable that the sensible objects which are outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should produce some effect in the "composite," <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> agreed with Democritus in this, that the operations of the sensitive part are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the impression of the sensible on the sense: not by a discharge, as Democritus said, but by some kind of operation. For Democritus maintained that every operation is by way of a discharge of atoms, as we gather from De Gener. i, 8. But <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> held that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has an operation which is independent of the body's cooperation. Now nothing corporeal can make an impression on the incorporeal. And therefore in order to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation according to <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, the impression <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the sensible does not suffice, but something more noble is required, for "the agent is more noble than the patient," as he says (De Gener. i, 5). Not, indeed, in the sense that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation is effected in us by the mere impression of some superior beings, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> held; but that the higher and more noble agent which he calls the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, of which we have spoken above (79, 3,4) <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the phantasms received from the senses to be actually intelligible, by a process of <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>.

<p>According to this opinion, then, on the part of the phantasms, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the senses. But since the phantasms cannot of themselves affect the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and require to be made actually intelligible by the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it cannot be said that sensible <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the total and perfect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but rather that it is in a way the material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> mean that we must not expect the entire <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the senses. For the light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is needed, through which we achieve the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of changeable things, and discern things themselves from their likeness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In this passage <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks not of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> but of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And since, according to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> has an operation which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> only, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, in order to show that corporeal images are impressed on the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, not by bodies but by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, uses the same argument as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> does in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> that the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> must be separate, namely, because "the agent is more noble than the patient." And without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, according to the above opinion, in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> there must needs be not only a passive but also an active power. But if we hold, according to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, that the action of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, is an action of the "composite," there is no difficulty; because the sensible body is more noble than the organ of the animal, in so far as it is compared to it as a being in act to a being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; even as the object actually colored is compared to the pupil which is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> colored. It may, however, be said, although the first impression of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is through the agency of the sensible, since "fancy is movement produced in accordance with sensation" (De Anima iii, 3), that nevertheless there is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> an operation which by synthesis and analysis forms images of various things, even of things not perceived by the senses. And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> words may be taken in this sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sensitive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not the entire <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And therefore it is not strange that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> should extend further than sensitive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the intellect can actually understand through the intelligible species of which it is possessed, without turning to the phantasms?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can actually understand through the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of which it is possessed, without turning to the phantasms. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is made actual by the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by which it is informed. But if the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is in act, it understands. Therefore the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> suffices for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to understand actually, without turning to the phantasms.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is more dependent on the senses than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> on the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> can actually <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> in the absence of the sensible. Therefore much more can the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understand without turning to the phantasms.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> There are no phantasms of incorporeal things: for the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> does not transcend time and space. If, therefore, our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot understand anything actually without turning to the phantasms, it follows that it cannot understand anything incorporeal. Which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: for we understand <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 7) that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands nothing without a phantasm."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the present state of life in which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to a passible body, it is impossible for our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to understand anything actually, except by turning to the phantasms.

<p>First of all because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, being a power that does not make use of a corporeal organ, would in no way be hindered in its act through the lesion of a corporeal organ, if for its act there were not required the act of some power that does make use of a corporeal organ. Now sense, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and the other powers belonging to the sensitive part, make use of a corporeal organ. Wherefore it is clear that for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to understand actually, not only when it acquires fresh <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but also when it applies <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> already acquired, there is need for the act of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and of the other powers. For when the act of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is hindered by a lesion of the corporeal organ, for instance in a case of frenzy; or when the act of the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is hindered, as in the case of lethargy, we see that a man is hindered from actually understanding things of which he had a previous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p>Secondly, anyone can experience this of himself, that when he tries to understand something, he forms certain phantasms to serve him by way of examples, in which as it were he examines what he is desirous of understanding. For this reason it is that when we wish to help someone to understand something, we lay examples before him, from which he forms phantasms for the purpose of understanding.

<p>Now the reason of this is that the power of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is proportioned to the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Wherefore the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is entirely separate from a body, is an intelligible <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> separate from a body. Whereas the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is united to a body, is a quiddity or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and through such natures of visible things it rises to a certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things invisible. Now it belongs to such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and this cannot be apart from corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: for instance, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a stone to be in an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> stone, and to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a horse to be in an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> horse, and so forth. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a stone or any material thing cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> completely and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, except in as much as it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Now we apprehend the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> through the senses and the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. And, therefore, for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to understand actually its proper object, it must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> turn to the phantasms in order to perceive the universal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. But if the proper object of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were a separate form; or if, as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> say, the natures of sensible things subsisted apart from the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>; there would be no need for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to turn to the phantasms whenever it understands.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> preserved in the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> there <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> when it does not understand them actually, as we have said above (Question 79, Article 6). Wherefore for us to understand actually, the fact that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are preserved does not suffice; we need further to make use of them in a manner befitting the things of which they are the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which things are natures <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even the phantasm is the likeness of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> thing; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> does not need any further likeness of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, whereas the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Incorporeal things, of which there are no phantasms, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us by comparison with sensible bodies of which there are phantasms. Thus we understand <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by considering a thing of which we possess the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. i), we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, by way of excess and by way of remotion. Other <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">incorporeal substances</a> we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, in the present state of life, only by way of remotion or by some comparison to corporeal things. And, therefore, when we understand something about these things, we need to turn to phantasms of bodies, although there are no phantasms of the things themselves.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the judgment of the intellect is hindered through suspension of the sensitive powers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not hindered by suspension of the sensitive powers. For the superior does not depend on the inferior. But the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is higher than the senses. Therefore the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not hindered through suspension of the senses.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to syllogize is an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But during sleep the senses are suspended, as is said in De Somn. et Vigil. i and yet it sometimes happens to us to syllogize while asleep. Therefore the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not hindered through suspension of the senses.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> What a man does while asleep, against the moral <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, is not imputed to him as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 15). But this would not be the case if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, while asleep, had free use of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is hindered by suspension of the senses.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have said above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>), our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect's</a> proper and proportionate object is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a sensible thing. Now a perfect judgment concerning anything cannot be formed, unless all that pertains to that thing's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; especially if that be ignored which is the term and end of judgment. Now the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Coel. iii), that "as the end of a practical science is action, so the end of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> science is that which is perceived principally through the senses"; for the smith does not seek <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a knife except for the purpose of action, in order that he may produce a certain <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> knife; and in like manner the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> philosopher does not seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a stone and of a horse, save for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> properties of those things which he perceives with his senses. Now it is clear that a smith cannot judge perfectly of a knife unless he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the action of the knife: and in like manner the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> philosopher cannot judge perfectly of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, unless he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> sensible things. But in the present state of life whatever we understand, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by comparison to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sensible things. Consequently it is not possible for our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to form a perfect judgment, while the senses are suspended, through which sensible things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is superior to the senses, nevertheless in a manner it receives from the senses, and its first and principal objects are founded in sensible things. And therefore suspension of the senses <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> involves a hindrance to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The senses are suspended in the sleeper through certain evaporations and the escape of certain exhalations, as we read in De Somn. et Vigil. iii. And, therefore, according to the amount of such evaporation, the senses are more or less suspended. For when the amount is considerable, not only are the senses suspended, but also the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, so that there are no phantasms; thus does it happen, especially when a man falls asleep after eating and drinking copiously. If, however, the evaporation be somewhat less, phantasms appear, but distorted and without sequence; thus it happens in a case of fever. And if the evaporation be still more attenuated, the phantasms will have a certain sequence: thus especially does it happen towards the end of sleep in sober men and those who are gifted with a strong <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. If the evaporation be very slight, not only does the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> retain its freedom, but also the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a> is partly freed; so that sometimes while asleep a man may judge that what he sees is a dream, discerning, as it were, between things, and their images. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a> remains partly suspended; and therefore, although it discriminates some images from the reality, yet is it always deceived in some particular. Therefore, while <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is asleep, according as sense and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> are free, so is the judgment of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> unfettered, though not entirely. Consequently, if a man syllogizes while asleep, when he wakes up he invariably recognizes a flaw in some respect.
