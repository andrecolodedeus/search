<h1>Question 84. The cause of sin, in respect of one sin being the cause of another</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2084.htm#article1"> Is covetousness the root of all sins?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2084.htm#article2"> Is pride the beginning of every sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2084.htm#article3"> Should other special sins be called capital vices, besides pride and covetousness?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2084.htm#article4"> How many capital vices there are, and which are they?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether covetousness is the root of all sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not the root of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is immoderate desire for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of liberality. But liberality is not the root of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not the root of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the desire for the means proceeds from desire for the end. Now <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, the desire for which is called <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, are not desired except as being useful for some end, as stated in Ethic. i, 5. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not the root of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but proceeds from some deeper root.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it often happens that avarice, which is another name for <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, arises from other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; as when a man desires money through ambition, or in order to sate his <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>. Therefore it is not the root of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1 Timothy 6:10</a>): "The desire of money is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to some, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> may be understood in different ways. First, as denoting inordinate desire for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>: and thus it is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Secondly, as denoting inordinate desire for any temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and thus it is a genus comprising all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> includes an inordinate turning to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (Question 72, Article 2). Thirdly, as denoting an inclination of a corrupt <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to desire corruptible goods inordinately: and they say that in this sense <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, comparing it to the root of a tree, which draws its sustenance from earth, just as every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> grows out of the love of temporal things.

<p>Now, though all this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it does not seem to explain the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> when he states that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For in that passage he clearly speaks against those who, because they "will become rich, fall into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, and into the snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> . . . for <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>." Hence it is evident that he is speaking of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> as denoting the inordinate desire for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Accordingly, we must say that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, as denoting a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is called the root of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in likeness to the root of a tree, in furnishing sustenance to the whole tree. For we see that by <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquires the means of committing any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever, and of sating his desire for any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever, since money helps <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to obtain all manner of temporal goods, according to <a href="../bible/ecc010.htm#verse19">Ecclesiastes 10:19</a>: "All things obey money": so that in this desire for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Virtue and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> do not arise from the same source. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> arises from the desire of mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and consequently the desire of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which helps one to obtain all temporal goods, is called the root of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> arises from the desire for the immutable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and consequently <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is called the root of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians 3:17</a>: "Rooted and founded in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The desire of money is said to be the root of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, not as though <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> were sought for their own sake, as being the last end; but because they are much sought after as useful for any temporal end. And since a universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is more desirable than a particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, they move the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> more than any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> goods, which along with many others can be procured by means of money.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things we do not ask what always happens, but what happens most frequently, for the reason that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of corruptible things can be hindered, so as not always to act in the same way; so also in moral matters, we consider what happens in the majority of cases, not what happens invariably, for the reason that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not act of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. So when we say that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, we do not assert that no other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can be its root, but that other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> more frequently arise therefrom, for the reason given.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether pride is the beginning of every sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not the beginning of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the root is a beginning of a tree, so that the beginning of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> seems to be the same as the root of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the root of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore it is also the beginning of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse14">Sirach 10:14</a>): "The beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is apostasy [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'to fall off'] from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But apostasy from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore another <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, so that the latter is not the beginning of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the beginning of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would seem to be that which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now this is inordinate self-love, which, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xiv), "builds up the city of Babylon." Therefore self-love and not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, is the beginning of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse15">Sirach 10:15</a>): "Pride is the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some say <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is to be taken in three ways. First, as denoting inordinate desire to excel; and thus it is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Secondly, as denoting actual contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the effect of not being subject to His commandment; and thus, they say, it is a generic <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Thirdly, as denoting an inclination to this contempt, owing to the corruption of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and in this sense they say that it is the beginning of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that it differs from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, because <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> regards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as turning towards the mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is, as it were, nourished and fostered, for which reason <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is called the "root"; whereas <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> regards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whose commandment <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> refuses to be subject, for which reason it is called the "beginning," because the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> consists in turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Now though all this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, nevertheless it does not explain the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who said (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse15">Sirach 10:15</a>): "Pride is the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." For it is evident that he is speaking of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> as denoting inordinate desire to excel, as is clear from what follows (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse17">verse 17</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath overturned the thrones of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> princes"; indeed this is the point of nearly the whole chapter. We must therefore say that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, even as denoting a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is the beginning of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For we must take note that, in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> actions, such as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, there is a twofold order, of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, and of execution. In the former order, the principle is the end, as we have stated many times before (1, 1, ad 1; 18, 7, ad 2; 15, 1, ad 2; 25, 2). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> end in acquiring all temporal goods is that, through their means, he may have some perfection and excellence. Therefore, from this point of view, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which is the desire to excel, is said to be the "beginning" of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On the other hand, in the order of execution, the first place belongs to that which by furnishing the opportunity of fulfilling all desires of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, has the character of a root, and such are <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>; so that, from this point of view, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is said to be the "root" of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>).

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Apostasy from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is stated to be the beginning of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, in so far as it denotes a turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because from the fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wishes not to be subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that he desires inordinately his own excellence in temporal things. Wherefore, in the passage quoted, apostasy from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not denote the special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but rather that general <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, consisting in its turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It may also be said that apostasy from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be the beginning of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, because it is the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For it is characteristic of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to be unwilling to be subject to any superior, and especially to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the result being that a man is unduly lifted up, in respect of the other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In desiring to excel, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves himself, for to love oneself is the same as to desire some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for oneself. Consequently it amounts to the same whether we reckon <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or self-love as the beginning of every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether any other special sins, besides pride and avarice, should be called capital?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no other special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, besides <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and avarice, should be called capital. Because "the head seems to be to an animal, what the root is to a plant," as stated in De Anima ii, text. 38: for the roots are like a mouth. If therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is called the "root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>," it seems that it alone, and no other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, should be called a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the head bears a certain relation of order to the other members, in so far as sensation and movement follow from the head. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> implies privation of order. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has not the character of head: so that no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be called capital.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, capital crimes are those which receive capital punishment. But every kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> comprises some that are punished thus. Therefore the capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not certain specific <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 17) enumerates certain special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> under the name of capital.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word capital is derived from "caput" [a head]. Now the head, properly speaking, is that part of an animal's body, which is the principle and director of the whole animal. Hence, metaphorically speaking, every principle is called a head, and even men who direct and govern others are called heads. Accordingly a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is so called, in the first place, from "head" taken in the proper sense, and thus the name "capital" is given to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for which capital punishment is inflicted. It is not in this sense that we are now speaking of capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but in another sense, in which the term "capital" is derived from head, taken metaphorically for a principle or director of others. In this way a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is one from which other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> arise, chiefly by being their final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which origin is formal, as stated above (Question 72, Article 6). Wherefore a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not only the principle of others, but is also their director and, in a way, their leader: because the art or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, to which the end belongs, is always the principle and the commander in matters concerning the means. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 17) compares these capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> to the "leaders of an army."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The term "capital" is taken from "caput" and applied to something connected with, or partaking of the head, as having some property thereof, but not as being the head taken literally. And therefore the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are not only those which have the character of primary origin, as <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> which is called the "root," and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> which is called the beginning, but also those which have the character of proximate origin in respect of several <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sin lacks order in so far as it turns away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for in this respect it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Natura Boni iv), is "the privation of mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order." But in so far as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> implies a turning to something, it regards some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: wherefore, in this respect, there can be order in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This objection considers capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as so called from the punishment it deserves, in which sense we are not taking it here.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the seven capital vices are suitably reckoned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought not to reckon seven capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, viz. vainglory, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, sloth, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But there are four principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (<a href="../summa/2061.htm#article2">Question 61, Article 2</a>). Therefore there are only four principal or capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (<a href="../summa/2077.htm">Question 77</a>). But there are four principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; two of which, viz. hope and fear, are not mentioned among the above <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, whereas certain <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are mentioned to which pleasure and sadness belong, since pleasure belongs to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and sadness to sloth and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. Therefore the principal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are unfittingly enumerated.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not a principal passion. Therefore it should not be placed among the principal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> or avarice is the root of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (<a href="../summa/2084.htm#article2">Question 84, Article 2</a>). But avarice is reckoned to be one of the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> also should be placed among the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are committed which cannot be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> through any of these: as, for instance, when one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or when one commits a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, e.g. steals in order to give an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Therefore the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are insufficiently enumerated.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> who enumerates them in this way (Moral. xxxi, 17).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="../summa/2084.htm#article3">Question 84, Article 3</a>), the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are those which give rise to others, especially by way of final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now this kind of origin may take place in two ways. First, on account of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the sinner, who is disposed so as to have a strong inclination for one particular end, the result being that he frequently goes forward to other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But this kind of origin does not come under the consideration of art, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> particular dispositions are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number. Secondly, on account of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> relationship of the ends to one another: and it is in this way that most frequently one <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> arises from another, so that this kind of origin can come under the consideration of art.

<p>Accordingly therefore, those <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are called capital, whose ends have certain fundamental reasons for moving the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; and it is in respect of these fundamental reasons that the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are differentiated. Now a thing moves the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in two ways. First, directly and of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: thus <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to seek it, while <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for the same reason, moves the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to avoid it. Secondly, indirectly and on account of something else, as it were: thus one seeks an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> on account of some attendant <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or avoids a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on account of some attendant <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p>Again, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is threefold. For, in the first place, there is a certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which derives its aspect of appetibility, merely through being apprehended, viz. the excellence of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and praise, and this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is sought inordinately by "vainglory." Secondly, there is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the body, and this regards either the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, e.g. meat and drink, which <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is pursued inordinately by "<a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>," or the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, e.g. sexual intercourse, which <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is sought inordinately by "<a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>." Thirdly, there is external <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, to which "<a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>" is referred. These same four <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> avoid inordinately the contrary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.

<p>Or again, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> chiefly through possessing some property of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> seek <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Now in the first place <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> implies perfection, since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is a perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to which belongs excellence or renown, which is desired by "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>" or "vainglory." Secondly, it implies satiety, which "<a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>" seeks in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> that give promise thereof. Thirdly, it implies pleasure, without which <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is impossible, as stated in Ethic. i, 7; x, 6,7,[8] and this "<a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>" and "<a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>" pursue.

<p>On the other hand, avoidance of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on account of an attendant <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> occurs in two ways. For this happens either in respect of one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and thus we have "sloth," which is sadness about one's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, on account of the attendant bodily labor: or else it happens in respect of another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and this, if it be without recrimination, belongs to "<a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>," which is sadness about another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as being a hindrance to one's own excellence, while if it be with recrimination with a view to vengeance, it is "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>." Again, these same <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> seek the contrary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Virtue and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> do not originate in the same way: since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the subordination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to reason, or to the immutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> arises from the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore there is no need for the principal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> to be contrary to the principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fear and hope are irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Now all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible part arise from <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part; and these are all, in a way, directed to pleasure or sorrow. Hence pleasure and sorrow have a prominent place among the capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as being the most important of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (<a href="../summa/2025.htm#article4">Question 25, Article 4</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not a principal passion, yet it has a distinct place among the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, because it implies a special kind of movement in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, in so far as recrimination against another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has the aspect of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, i.e. of the right to vengeance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Pride is said to be the beginning of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in the order of the end, as stated above (<a href="../summa/2084.htm#article2">Question 84, Article 2</a>): and it is in the same order that we are to consider the capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as being principal. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, like a universal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, is not counted along with the others, but is reckoned as the "queen of them all," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states (Moral. xxxi, 27). But <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is said to be the root from another point of view, as stated above (<a href="../summa/2084.htm#article1">Question 84, Article 1</a>, <a href="../summa/2084.htm#article2">Question 84, Article 2</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> These <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are called capital because others, most frequently, arise from them: so that nothing prevents some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from arising out of other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Nevertheless we might say that all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are due to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, can be reduced to sloth, to which pertains the negligence of a man who declines to acquire <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods on account of the attendant labor; for the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is due to negligence, as stated above (<a href="../summa/2076.htm#article2">Question 76, Article 2</a>). That a man commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, seems to point to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, in so far as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should not be done that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may come of it.
