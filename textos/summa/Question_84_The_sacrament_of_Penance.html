<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Penance is a sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that Penance is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [Cf. <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a>, Etym. vi, ch. 19] says: "The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, Chrism, and the Body and Blood of Christ; which are called <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> because under the veil of corporeal things the Divine power works out <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in a hidden manner." But this does not happen in Penance, because therein corporeal things are not employed that, under them, the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may work our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Therefore Penance is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are shown forth by the ministers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>: "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the dispensers of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But Penance is not conferred by the ministers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but is inspired inwardly into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse19">Jeremiah 31:19</a>: "After Thou didst convert me, I did penance." Therefore it seems that Penance is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of which we have already spoken above, there is something that is sacrament only, something that is both reality and sacrament, and something that is reality only, as is clear from what has been stated (66, 1). But this does not apply to Penance. Therefore Penance is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is conferred that we may be cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so also is Penance: wherefore Peter said to <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse22">Acts 8:22</a>): "Do penance . . . from this thy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>." But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as stated above (Question 66, Article 1). Therefore for the same reason Penance is also a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says [<a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a>, Etym. vi, ch. 19, "a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> consists in a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> act, whereby something is so done that we understand it to signify the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> which it confers." Now it is evident that in Penance something is done so that something <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> is signified both on the part of the penitent sinner, and on the part of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> absolving, because the penitent sinner, by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> and word, shows his heart to have renounced <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and in like manner the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, by his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> and word with regard to the penitent, signifies the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who forgives his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore it is evident that Penance, as practiced in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By corporeal things taken in a wide sense we may understand also external sensible actions, which are to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> what water is to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, or chrism to Confirmation. But it is to be observed that in those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, whereby an exceptional <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> surpassing altogether the proportion of a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>, is conferred, some corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is employed externally, e.g. in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which confers full remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, both as to guilt and as to punishment, and in Confirmation, wherein the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is bestowed, and in <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>, which confers perfect <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> health derived from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as from an extrinsic principle. Wherefore, such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> as are in these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, are not the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but are dispositions thereto. On the other hand, in those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> whose effect corresponds to that of some <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>, the sensible <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> itself takes the place of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as in the case of Penance and Matrimony, even as in bodily medicines, some are applied externally, such as plasters and drugs, while others are acts of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who seeks to be cured, such as certain exercises.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which have a corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, this matter needs to be applied by a minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who stands in the place of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which denotes that the excellence of the power which operates in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, as stated above (ad 1), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions take the place of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and these actions proceed from internal inspiration, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not applied by the minister, but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> working inwardly; while the minister furnishes the complement of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, when he absolves the penitent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In Penance also, there is something which is sacrament only, viz. the acts performed outwardly both by the repentant sinner, and by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in giving <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>; that which is reality and sacrament is the sinner's inward repentance; while that which is reality, and not sacrament, is the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The first of these taken altogether is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the second; and the first and second together are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the third.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether sins are the proper matter of this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Because, in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is hallowed by the utterance of certain words, and being thus hallowed produces the sacramental effect. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> cannot be hallowed, for they are opposed to the effect of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which blots out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book De Poenitentia [Cf. Serm. cccli]: "No one can begin a new life, unless he repent of the old." Now not only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> but also the penalties of the present life belong to the old life. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of Penance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is either original, mortal or venial. Now the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> is not ordained against <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, for this is taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, [nor against mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for this is taken away by the sinner's confession]*, nor against venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is taken away by the beating of the breast and the sprinkling of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> water and the like. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of Penance. [The words in brackets are omitted in the Leonine edition].

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse21">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>): "(Who) have not done penance for the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> and fornication and lasciviousness, that they have committed."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Matter is twofold, viz. proximate and remote: thus the proximate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a statue is a metal, while the remote <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is water. Now it has been stated (1, ad 1, ad 2), that the proximate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> consists in the acts of the penitent, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of which acts are the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> over which he grieves, which he confesses, and for which he satisfies. Hence it follows that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are the remote <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of Penance, as a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, not for approval, but for detestation, and destruction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers the proximate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The old life that was subject to death is the object of Penance, not as regards the punishment, but as regards the guilt connected with it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Penance regards every kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in a way, but not each in the same way. Because Penance regards actual mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> properly and chiefly; properly, since, properly speaking, we are said to repent of what we have done of our own will; chiefly, since this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was instituted chiefly for the blotting out of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Penance regards venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, properly speaking indeed, in so far as they are committed of our own will, but this was not the chief purpose of its institution. But as to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, Penance regards it neither chiefly, since <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and not Penance, is ordained against <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, nor properly, because <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not done of our own will, except in so far as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is looked upon as ours, in which sense the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>): "In whom all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>." Nevertheless, Penance may be said to regard <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, if we take it in a wide sense for any detestation of something past: in which sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> uses the term in his book De Poenitentia (Serm. cccli).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the form of this sacrament is: "I absolve thee"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee." Because the forms of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are received from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> institution and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> custom. But we do not read that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> instituted this form. Nor is it in common use; in fact in certain absolutions which are given publicly in church (e.g. at Prime and Compline and on Maundy Thursday), <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is given not in the indicative form by saying: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee," but In the deprecatory form, by saying: "May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> have mercy on you," or: "May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> grant you <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and forgiveness." Therefore the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Pope Leo says (Ep. cviii) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> forgiveness cannot be obtained without the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> supplications: and he is speaking there of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> forgiveness granted to the penitent. Therefore the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should be deprecatory.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the same as to remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone remits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for He alone cleanses <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> inwardly from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Donatist. v, 21). Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone absolves from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should say not: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee," as neither does he say: "I remit thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> gave His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the power to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so also did He give them the power "to heal infirmities," "to cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a>," and "to cure diseases" (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse1">Matthew 10:1</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse1">Luke 9:1</a>). Now the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in healing the sick, did not use the words: "I heal thee," but: "The Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> heal [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'heals'] thee," as Peter said to the palsied <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse34">Acts 9:34</a>). Therefore since <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have the power which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, it seems that they should not use the form: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee," but: "May <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, some explain this form by stating that when they say: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee," they mean "I declare you to be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a>." But neither can this be done by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> unless it be revealed to him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherefore, as we read in <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a> before it was said to Peter: "Whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth," etc., it was said to him (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse17">Matthew 16:17</a>): "Blessed art thou <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Bar-Jona</a>: because flesh and blood have not revealed it to thee, but My Father Who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Therefore it seems presumptuous for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who has received no <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> on the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, to say: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee," even if this be explained to mean: "I declare thee <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>): "Going . . . teach ye all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them," etc., so did He say to Peter (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>): "Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth," etc. Now the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, relying on the authority of those words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, says: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee." Therefore on the same authority he should say in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The perfection of a thing is ascribed to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now it has been stated above (1, ad 2) that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is perfected by that which is done by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Wherefore the part taken by the penitent, whether it consist of words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, must needs be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, while the part taken by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, takes the place of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p>Now since the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> accomplish what they signify, as stated above (62, 1, ad 1), it behooves the sacramental form to signify the sacramental effect in a manner that is in keeping with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence the form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee," and the form of Confirmation is: "I sign thee with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, and I confirm thee with the chrism of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>," because these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are perfected in the use of their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: while in the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which consists in the very <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the reality of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is expressed in the words: "This is My Body."

<p>Now this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, namely the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, consists not in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, nor in the use of a hallowed <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but rather in the removal of a certain <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are said to be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of Penance, as explained above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). This removal is expressed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> saying: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee": because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are fetters, according to <a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse22">Proverbs 5:22</a>. "His own iniquities catch the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and he is fast bound with the ropes of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Wherefore it is evident that this is the most fitting form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This form is taken from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> very words which He addressed to Peter (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>): "Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth," etc., and such is the form employed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in sacramental <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. But such absolutions as are given in public are not sacramental, but are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Wherefore in giving sacramental <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> it would not suffice to say: "May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> have mercy on thee," or: "May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant thee <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and forgiveness," because by such words the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not signify the giving of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that it may be given. Nevertheless the above <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is said before the sacramental <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is given, lest the sacramental effect be hindered on the part of the penitent, whose acts are as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but not in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> or Confirmation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The words of Leo are to be understood of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that precedes the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, and do not exclude the fact that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> pronounces <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone absolves from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> authoritatively; yet <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> do both ministerially, because the words of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> work as instruments of the Divine power, as in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: because it is the Divine power that works inwardly in all the sacramental signs, be they things or words, as shown above (62, 4; 64, 1,2). Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> expressed both: for He said to Peter (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>): "Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth," etc., and to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John 20:23</a>): "Whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive, they are forgiven them." Yet the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> says: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee," rather than: "I forgive thee thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," because it is more in keeping with the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, by expressing the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> absolve. Nevertheless, since the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> absolves ministerially, something is suitably added in reference to the supreme authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> saying: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," or by the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, or by the authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. However, as this is not defined by the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as it is for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, this addition is left to the discretion of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Power was given to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, not that they themselves might heal the sick, but that the sick might be healed at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: whereas power was given to them to work instrumentally or ministerially in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; wherefore they could express their own agency in the sacramental forms rather than in the healing of infirmities. Nevertheless in the latter case they did not always use the deprecatory form, but sometimes employed the indicative or imperative: thus we read (<a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse6">Acts 3:6</a>) that Peter said to the lame <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: "What I have, I give thee: In the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> of Nazareth, arise and walk."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in a sense that the words, "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee" mean "I declare thee <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a>," but this explanation is incomplete. Because the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> not only signify, but effect what they signify. Wherefore, just as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> anyone, declares by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> and word that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is washed inwardly, and this not only significatively but also effectively, so also when he says: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee," he declares the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> not only significatively but also effectively. And yet he does not speak as of something uncertain, because just as the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> have, of themselves, a sure effect through the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, which effect, nevertheless, may be impeded on the part of the recipient, so is it with this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Adult. Conjug. ii): "There is nothing disgraceful or onerous in the reconciliation of husband and wife, when <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> committed has been washed away, since there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is granted through the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>." Consequently there is no need for a special <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> to be made to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but the general <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> suffices, through which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven. Hence the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is said to have been made to Peter.

<p>It would be a more complete explanation to say that the words, "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee" mean: "I grant thee the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the imposition of the priest's hands is necessary for this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the imposition of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> hands is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse18">Mark 16:18</a>): "They shall lay hands upon the sick, and they shall recover." Now sinners are sick spiritually, and obtain recovery through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore an imposition of hands should be made in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> regains the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Whom he had lost, wherefore it is said in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the penitent (<a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse14">Psalm 1:14</a>): "Restore unto me the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of Thy <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and strengthen me with a perfect spirit." Now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is given by the imposition of hands; for we read (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse17">Acts 8:17</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> "laid their hands upon them, and they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>"; and (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse13">Matthew 19:13</a>) that "little children were presented" to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, "that He should impose hands upon them." Therefore an imposition of hands should be made in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> words are not more efficacious in this than in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> the words of the minister do not suffice, unless he perform some action: thus, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> while saying: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee," has to perform a bodily washing. Therefore, also while saying: "I <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee," the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should perform some action in regard to the penitent, by laying hands on him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said to Peter (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>): "Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth," etc., He made no mention of an imposition of hands; nor did He when He said to all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse13">John 20:13</a>): "Whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive, they are forgiven them." Therefore no imposition of hands is required for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the imposition of hands is made, to signify some abundant effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, through those on whom the hands are laid being, as it were, united to the ministers in whom <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> should be plentiful. Wherefore an imposition of hands is made in the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a>, wherein the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is conferred; and in the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a>, wherein is bestowed a certain excellence of power over the Divine mysteries; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse6">2 Timothy 1:6</a>): "Stir up the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which is in thee, by the imposition of my hands."

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> is ordained, not that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may receive some abundance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but that his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be taken away; and therefore no imposition of hands is required for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as neither is there for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, wherein nevertheless a fuller remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is bestowed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That imposition of hands is not sacramental, but is intended for the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, namely, that by the contact of a sanctified <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> hand, even bodily infirmity might be removed; even as we read of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse5">Mark 6:5</a>) that He cured the sick, "laying His hands upon them," and (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse3">Matthew 8:3</a>) that He cleansed a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> by touching him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not every reception of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> that requires an imposition of hands, since even in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, without any imposition of hands: it is at the reception of the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which belongs to Confirmation that an imposition of hands is required.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which are perfected in the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the minister has to perform some bodily action on the recipient of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, e.g. in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, Confirmation, and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>; whereas this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not consist in the use of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> employed outwardly, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> being supplied by the part taken by the penitent: wherefore, just as in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> perfects the sacrament by merely pronouncing the words over the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so the mere words which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> while absolving pronounces over the penitent perfect the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. If, indeed, any bodily act were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, which is employed in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, would not be less becoming than the imposition of hands, in token that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven through the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> crucified; and yet this is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as neither is it to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether this sacrament is necessary for salvation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Because on <a href="../bible/psa125.htm#verse5">Psalm 125:5</a>, "They that sow in tears," etc., the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Be not sorrowful, if thou hast a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will, of which peace is the meed." But sorrow is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to Penance, according to <a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>: "The sorrow that is according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> worketh penance steadfast unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>." Therefore a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will without Penance suffices for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse12">Proverbs 10:12</a>): "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> covereth all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," and further on (<a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse27">Proverbs 15:27</a>): "By mercy and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are purged away." But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is for nothing else but the purging of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore if one has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and mercy, one can obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, without the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> take their origin from the institution of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But according to <a href="../bible/joh008.htm">John 8</a> Christ <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> without Penance. Therefore it seems that Penance is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse3">Luke 13:3</a>): "Unless you shall do penance, you shall all likewise perish."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in two ways: first, absolutely; secondly, on a supposition. A thing is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, if no one can obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> without it, as, for example, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>, whereby a man is born again in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> on a supposition, for it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, not for all, but for those who are in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/2ch033.htm">2 Chronicles 33</a> [The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Manasses, among the Apocrypha), "Thou, Lord, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the righteous, hast not appointed repentance to the righteous, to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, nor to those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> not against Thee." But "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when it is completed, begetteth death" (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse15">James 1:15</a>). Consequently it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the sinner's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be taken away from him; which cannot be done without the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, wherein the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> operates through the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and the acts of the penitent, who co-operates with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unto the destruction of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxii in Joan. [Implicitly in the passage referred to, but explicitly Serm. xv de verb Apost.), "He Who <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thee without thee, will not justify thee without thee." Therefore it is evident that after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, even as bodily medicine after <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has contracted a dangerous disease.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> should apparently be understood as referring to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will unimpaired by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for such a man has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for sorrow: but as soon as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is forfeited through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it cannot be restored without that sorrow whereby a man sorrows for his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and which belongs to Penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As soon as a man falls into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and mercy do not deliver him from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, without Penance. Because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> demands that a man should grieve for the offense committed against his friend, and that he should be anxious to make satisfaction to his friend; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> requires that he should seek to be justified from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> which operates in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and well-ordered pity necessitates that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should succor himself by repenting of the pitiful <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> into which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has brought him, according to <a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse34">Proverbs 14:34</a>: "Sin maketh nations miserable"; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/sir030.htm#verse24">Sirach 30:24</a>): "Have pity on thy own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, pleasing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It was due to His power of "excellence," which He alone had, as stated above (Question 64, Article 3), that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> the effect of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, viz. the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, without the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, although not without internal repentance, which He operated in her by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether Penance is a second plank after shipwreck?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that Penance is not a second plank after shipwreck. Because on <a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse9">Isaiah 3:9</a>, "They have proclaimed abroad their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as Sodom," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "The second plank after shipwreck is to hide one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Now Penance does not hide <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but reveals them. Therefore Penance is not a second plank.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in a building the foundation takes the first, not the second place. Now in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> edifice, Penance is the foundation, according to <a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse1">Hebrews 6:1</a>: "Not laying again the foundation of Penance from dead works"; wherefore it precedes even <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, according to <a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse38">Acts 2:38</a>: "Do penance, and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> every one of you." Therefore Penance should not be called a second plank.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are planks, i.e. helps against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now Penance holds, not the second but the fourth, place among the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as is clear from what has been said above (65, 1,2). Therefore Penance should not be called a second plank after shipwreck.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. cxxx) that "Penance is a second plank after shipwreck."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> That which is of itself precedes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, as <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Now some <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are, of themselves, ordained to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> birth, Confirmation which is the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> growth, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food; whereas Penance is ordained to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> as it were, and on something being supposed, viz. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for unless <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> actually, he would not stand in need of Penance and yet he would need <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, Confirmation, and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>; even as in the life of the body, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would need no medical treatment, unless he were ill, and yet life, birth, growth, and food are, of themselves, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>Consequently Penance holds the second place with regard to the state of integrity which is bestowed and safeguarded by the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, so that it is called metaphorically "a second plank after shipwreck." For just as the first help for those who cross the sea is to be safeguarded in a whole ship, while the second help when the ship is wrecked, is to cling to a plank; so too the first help in this life's ocean is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> safeguard his integrity, while the second help is, if he lose his integrity through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that he regain it by means of Penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To hide one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may happen in two ways: first, in the very act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Now it is worse to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in public than in private, both because a public sinner seems to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more from contempt, and because by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> he gives <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to others. Consequently in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> it is a kind of remedy to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> secretly, and it is in this sense that the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that "to hide one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is a second plank after shipwreck"; not that it takes away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as Penance does, but because it makes the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> less grievous. Secondly, one hides one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> previously committed, by neglecting to confess it: this is opposed to Penance, and to hide one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> thus is not a second plank, but is the reverse, since it is written (<a href="../bible/pro028.htm#verse13">Proverbs 28:13</a>): "He that hideth his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall not prosper."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Penance cannot be called the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> edifice simply, i.e. in the first building thereof; but it is the foundation in the second building which is accomplished by destroying <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on his return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, needs Penance first. However, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking there of the foundation of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> doctrine. Moreover, the penance which precedes <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The three <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which precede Penance refer to the ship in its integrity, i.e. to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> state of integrity, with regard to which Penance is called a second plank.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether this sacrament was suitably instituted in the New Law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was unsuitably instituted in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Because those things which belong to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> need not to be instituted. Now it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> that one should repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one has done: for it is impossible to love <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> without grieving for its contrary. Therefore Penance was unsuitably instituted in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> had not to be instituted in the New. Now there was Penance in the old Law wherefore the Lord complains (<a href="../bible/jer008.htm#verse6">Jeremiah 8:6</a>) saying: "There is none that doth penance for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, saying: What have I done?" Therefore Penance should not have been instituted in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Penance comes after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, since it is a second plank, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>). Now it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> instituted Penance before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, because we read that at the beginning of His preaching He said (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse17">Matthew 4:17</a>): "Do penance, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand." Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was not suitably instituted in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> were instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by Whose power they work, as stated above (62, 5; 64, 1). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not seem to have instituted this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, since He made no use of it, as of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which He instituted. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was unsuitably instituted in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse46">Luke 24:46-47</a>): "It behooved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to suffer, and to rise again from the dead the third day: and that penance and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be preached in His name unto all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 1, ad 2), in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the acts of the penitent are as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, while the part taken by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who works as Christ's minister, is the formal and completive element of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, being provided by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as water, or by art, as bread: but that such and such a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> be employed for a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> requires to be decided by the institution; while the sacrament derives its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> and power entirely from the institution of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, from Whose <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> proceeds.

<p>Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, being provided by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; since it is by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principle of reason that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is moved to repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> he has done: yet it is due to Divine institution that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does penance in this or that way. Wherefore at the outset of His preaching, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> admonished men, not only to repent, but also to "do penance," thus pointing to the particular manner of actions required for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. As to the part to be taken by the ministers, this was fixed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> when He said to Peter (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>): "To thee will I give the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>," etc.; but it was after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> that He made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the efficacy of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and the source of its power, when He said (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse47">Luke 24:47</a>) that "penance and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be preached in His name unto all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>," after speaking of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. Because it is from the power of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> suffering and rising again that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is efficacious unto the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>It is therefore evident that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was suitably instituted in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is a <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> that one should repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one has done, by grieving for having done it, and by seeking a remedy for one's grief in some way or other, and also that one should show some signs of grief, even as the Ninevites did, as we read in <a href="../bible/jon003.htm">Jonah 3</a>. And yet even in their case there was also something of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they had received through <a href="../cathen/08497b.htm">Jonas'</a> preaching, inasmuch as they did these things in the hope that they would receive pardon from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according as we read (<a href="../bible/jon003.htm#verse9">Jonah 3:9</a>): "Who can tell if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will turn and forgive, and will turn away from His fierce <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and we shall not perish?" But just as other matters which are of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> were fixed in detail by the institution of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, as we have stated in I-II, 91, 4; I-II, 95, 2; I-II, 99, so was it with Penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Things which are of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> were determined in various ways in the old and in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, in keeping with the imperfection of the old, and the perfection of the New. Wherefore Penance was fixed in a certain way in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>--with regard to sorrow, that it should be in the heart rather than in external signs, according to <a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse13">Joel 2:13</a>: "Rend your hearts and not your garments"; and with regard to seeking a remedy for sorrow, that they should in some way confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, at least in general, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ministers. Wherefore the Lord said (<a href="../bible/lev005.htm#verse17">Leviticus 5:17-18</a>): "If anyone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> . . . he shall offer of the flocks a ram without blemish to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, according to the measure and estimation of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him, because he did it ignorantly, and it shall be forgiven him"; since by the very fact of making an offering for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a man, in a fashion, confessed his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. And accordingly it is written (<a href="../bible/pro028.htm#verse13">Proverbs 28:13</a>): "He that hideth his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, shall not prosper: but he that shall confess, and forsake them, shall obtain mercy." Not yet, however, was the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> instituted, which is derived from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, and consequently it was not yet ordained that a man should grieve for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, with the purpose of submitting himself by confession and satisfaction to the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in the hope of receiving forgiveness through the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If we note carefully what <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said about the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse3">John 3:3, sqq.</a>), we shall see that this was said before His words about the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of Penance (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse17">Matthew 4:17</a>); because He spoke to Nicodemus about <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> before the imprisonment of John, of whom it is related afterwards (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse23">John 3:23-24</a>) that he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, whereas His words about Penance were said after John was cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.

<p>If, however, He had admonished men to do penance before admonishing them to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, this would be because also before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> some kind of penance is required, according to the words of Peter (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse38">Acts 2:38</a>): "Do penance, and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, every one of you."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not use the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> which He instituted, but was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, as stated above (39, 1,2). Nor did He use it actively by administering it Himself, because He "did not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>" as a rule, "but His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>" did, as related in <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse2">John 4:2</a>, although it is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> asserts (Ep. cclxv, ad Seleuc.). But with regard to His institution of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> it was nowise fitting that He should use it, neither by repenting Himself, in Whom there was no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor by administering the sacrament to others, since, in order to show His mercy and power, He was wont to confer the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> without the sacrament itself, as stated above (5, ad 3). On the other hand, He both received and gave to others the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, both in order to commend the excellence of that sacrament, and because that sacrament is a memorial of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and victim.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether Penance should last till the end of life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that Penance should not last till the end of life. Because Penance is ordained for the blotting out of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the penitent receives forgiveness of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> at once, according to <a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse21">Ezekiel 18:21</a>: "If the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> do penance for all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he hath committed . . . he shall live and shall not die." Therefore there is no need for Penance to be further prolonged.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Penance belongs to the state of beginners. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to advance from that state to the state of the proficient, and, from this, on to the state of the perfect. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> need not do Penance till the end of his life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to observe the laws of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in this as in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But the duration of repentance is fixed by the canons, so that, to wit, for such and such a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> one is bound to do penance for so many years. Therefore it seems that Penance should not be prolonged till the end of life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book, De Poenitentia [De vera et falsa Poenitentia, the authorship of which is unknown]: "What remains for us to do, save to sorrow ever in this life? For when sorrow ceases, repentance fails; and if repentance fails, what becomes of pardon?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Penance is twofold, internal and external. Internal penance is that whereby one grieves for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> one has committed, and this penance should last until the end of life. Because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should always be displeased at having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, for if he were to be pleased thereat, he would for this very reason fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and lose the fruit of pardon. Now displeasure <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow in one who is susceptible to sorrow, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in this life; but after this life the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are not susceptible to sorrow, wherefore they will be displeased at, without sorrowing for, their past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse16">Isaiah 65:16</a>. "The former distresses are forgotten."

<p>External penance is that whereby a man shows external signs of sorrow, confesses his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> verbally to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who absolves him, and makes satisfaction for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> according to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Such penance need not last until the end of life, but only for a fixed time according to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">True</a> penance not only removes past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but also preserves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Consequently, although a man receives forgiveness of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the first instant of his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> penance, nevertheless he must persevere in his penance, lest he fall again into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To do penance both internal and external belongs to the state of beginners, of those, to wit, who are making a fresh start from the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But there is room for internal penance even in the proficient and the perfect, according to <a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse7">Psalm 83:7</a>: "In his heart he hath disposed to ascend by steps, in the vale of tears." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>): "I . . . am not worthy to be called an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> because I <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These durations of time are fixed for penitents as regards the exercise of external penance.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether Penance can be continuous?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that penance cannot be continuous. For it is written (<a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse16">Jeremiah 31:16</a>): "Let thy voice cease from weeping, and thy eyes from tears." But this would be impossible if penance were continuous, for it consists in weeping and tears. Therefore penance cannot be continuous.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to rejoice at every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work, according to <a href="../bible/psa099.htm#verse1">Psalm 99:1</a>: "Serve ye the Lord with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">gladness</a>." Now to do penance is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should rejoice at it. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot rejoice and grieve at the same time, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. ix, 4). Therefore a penitent cannot grieve continually for his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to penance. Therefore penance cannot be continuous.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>): "Comfort him," viz. the penitent, "lest perhaps such an one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow." But comfort dispels grief, which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to penance. Therefore penance need not be continuous.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book on Penance [De vera et falsa Poenitentia, the authorship of which is unknown]: "In doing penance grief should be continual."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> One is said to repent in two ways, actually and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>. It is impossible for a man continually to repent actually. for the acts, whether internal or external, of a penitent must needs be interrupted by sleep and other things which the body needs. Secondly, a man is said to repent <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>. and thus he should repent continually, both by never doing anything contrary to penance, so as to destroy the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> disposition of the penitent, and by being resolved that his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should always be displeasing to him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Weeping and tears belong to the act of external penance, and this act needs neither to be continuous, nor to last until the end of life, as stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>): wherefore it is significantly added: "For there is a reward for thy work." Now the reward of the penitent's work is the full remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> both as to guilt and as to punishment; and after receiving this reward there is no need for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to proceed to acts of external penance. This, however, does not prevent penance being continual, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Of sorrow and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> we may speak in two ways: first, as being <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; and thus they can no. wise be together, since they are altogether contrary to one another, either on the part of the object (as when they have the same object), or at least on the part of the movement, for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is with expansion [Cf. I-II, 33, 1] of the heart, whereas sorrow is with contraction; and it is in this sense that the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks in Ethic. ix. Secondly, we may speak of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sorrow as being simple acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, to which something is pleasing or displeasing. Accordingly, they cannot be contrary to one another, except on the part of the object, as when they concern the same object in the same respect, in which way <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sorrow cannot be simultaneous, because the same thing in the same respect cannot be pleasing and displeasing. If, on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sorrow, understood thus, be not of the same object in the same respect, but either of different objects, or of the same object in different respects, in that case <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sorrow are not contrary to one another, so that nothing hinders a man from being <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyful</a> and sorrowful at the same time--for instance, if we see a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suffer, we both rejoice at his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and at the same time grieve for his suffering. In this way a man may be displeased at having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and be pleased at his displeasure together with his hope for pardon, so that his very sorrow is a matter of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says [De vera et falsa Poenitentia, the authorship of which is unknown]: "The penitent should ever grieve and rejoice at his grief."

<p>If, however, sorrow were altogether incompatible with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, this would prevent the continuance, not of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> penance, but only of actual penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 3,6,7,9) it belongs to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to establish the mean in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Now the sorrow which, in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of the penitent, arises from the displeasure of his will, is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>; wherefore it should be moderated according to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and if it be excessive it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, because it leads to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> teaches (<a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>), saying: "Lest such an one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow." Accordingly comfort, of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> speaks, moderates sorrow but does not destroy it altogether.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether the sacrament of Penance may be repeated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> should not be repeated. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse4">Hebrews 6:4, seqq.</a>): "It is impossible for those, who were once illuminated, have tasted also the heavenly <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, and were made partakers of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> . . . and are fallen away, to be renewed again to penance." Now whosoever have done penance, have been illuminated, and have received the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore whosoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after doing penance, cannot do penance again.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Poenit. ii): "Some are to be found who think they ought often to do penance, who take liberties with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: for if they were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> penitent, they would not think of doing penance over again, since there is but one Penance even as there is but one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not repeated. Neither, therefore, is Penance to be repeated.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> healed bodily diseases, signify the healing of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> diseases, whereby men are delivered from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now we do not read that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> restored the sight to any blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> twice, or that He cleansed any <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> twice, or twice raised any dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to life. Therefore it seems that He does not twice grant pardon to any sinner.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.): "Penance consists in deploring past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and in not committing again those we have deplored": and <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Summo Bono ii): "He is a mocker and no penitent who still does what he has repented of." If, therefore, a man is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> penitent, he will not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> again. Therefore Penance cannot be repeated.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> derives its efficacy from the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, so does Penance. Now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not repeated, on account of the unity of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and death. Therefore in like manner Penance is not repeated.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse58">Psalm 118:58</a>, "I entreated Thy face," etc., that "facility of obtaining pardon is an incentive to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> frequently grants pardon through Penance, it seems that He affords <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> an incentive to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and thus He seems to take pleasure in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is contrary to His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Therefore Penance cannot be repeated.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is induced to be merciful by the example of Divine mercy, according to <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse36">Luke 6:36</a>: "Be ye . . . merciful, as your Father also is merciful." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> commanded His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to be merciful by frequently pardoning their brethren who had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against them; wherefore, as related in <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse21">Matthew 18:21</a>, when Peter asked: "How often shall my brother off end against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: "I say not to thee, till seven times, but till seventy times seven times." Therefore also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over and over again, through Penance, grants pardon to sinners, especially as He teaches us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew 6:12</a>): "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As regards Penance, some have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a>, saying that a man cannot obtain pardon of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through Penance a second time. Some of these, viz. the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a>, went so far as to say that he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> after the first Penance which is done in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, cannot be restored again through Penance. There were also other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> relates in De Poenitentia [De vera et falsa Poenitentia, the authorship of which is unknown, said that, after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, Penance is useful, not many times, but only once.

<p>These <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> seem to have arisen from a twofold source: first from not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Penance. For since <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Penance requires <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, without which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not taken away, they thought that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> once possessed could not be lost, and that, consequently, Penance, if <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, could never be removed by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that it should be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to repeat it. But this was refuted in the II-II, 24, 11, where it was shown that on account of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, once possessed, can be lost, and that, consequently, after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Penance, a man can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally. Secondly, they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in their estimation of the gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For they deemed a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed by a man after he had received pardon, to be so grave that it could not be forgiven. In this they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> not only with regard to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which, even after a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been forgiven, can be either more or less grievous than the first, which was forgiven, but much more did they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of Divine mercy, which surpasses any number and magnitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse1">Psalm 50:1-2</a>: "Have mercy on me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to Thy great mercy: and according to the multitude of Thy tender mercies, blot out my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>." Wherefore the words of Cain were reprehensible, when he said (<a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse13">Genesis 4:13</a>): "My <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> is greater than that I may deserve pardon." And so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy, through Penance, grants pardon to sinners without any end, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/2ch033.htm">2 Chronicles 33</a> [<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> of Manasses], among the Apocrypha. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> is evidently quoting from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, and omits the words in brackets.): "Thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable . . . (and Thou repentest) for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> brought upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." It is therefore evident that Penance can be repeated many times.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> thought that a man could be washed several times in the laver of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, because among them the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> prescribed certain washing-places where they were wont to cleanse themselves repeatedly from their uncleannesses. In order to disprove this the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> wrote to the Hebrews that "it is impossible for those who were once illuminated," viz. through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, "to be renewed again to penance," viz. through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which is "the laver of regeneration, and renovation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," as stated in <a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse5">Titus 3:5</a>: and he declares the reason to be that by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> dies with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, wherefore he adds (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse6">Hebrews 6:6</a>): "Crucifying again to themselves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> is speaking of <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> Penance, which is not repeated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as we shall state further on (XP, 28, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says [De vera et falsa Poenitentia the authorship of which is unknown, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> gave sight to many blind men at various times, and strength to many infirm, thereby showing, in these different men, that the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are repeatedly forgiven, at one time healing a man from <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> and afterwards from blindness. For this reason He healed so many stricken with fever, so many feeble in body, so many lame, blind, and withered, that the sinner might not <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>; for this reason He is not described as healing anyone but once, that every one might fear to link himself with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for this reason He declares Himself to be the physician welcomed not of the hale, but of the unhealthy. What sort of a physician is he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not how to heal a recurring disease? For if a man ail a hundred times it is for the physician to heal him a hundred times: and if he failed where others succeed, he would be a poor physician in comparison with them."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Penance is to deplore past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and, "while deploring them," not to commit again, either by act or by <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, those which we have to deplore. Because a man is a mocker and not a penitent, who, "while doing penance," does what he repents having done, or intends to do again what he did before, or even commits actually the same or another kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> afterwards either by act or <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, this does not destroy the fact that his former penance was real, because the reality of a former act is never destroyed by a subsequent contrary act: for even as he <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> ran who afterwards sits, so he <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> repented who subsequently <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> derives its power from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, with a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> death, of a previous life. Now "it is appointed unto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> once to die" (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse27">Hebrews 9:27</a>), and to be born once, wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> but once. On the other hand, Penance derives its power from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> medicine, which can be repeated frequently.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De vera et falsa Poenitentia, the authorship of which is unknown), "it is evident that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> displease <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> exceedingly, for He is always ready to destroy them, lest what He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> should perish, and what He loved be lost," viz. by <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>.
