<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Penance is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that penance is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For penance is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> numbered among the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as was shown above (84, 1; 65, 1). Now no other sacrament is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore neither is penance a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 9), "shame is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," both because it is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> accompanied by a bodily alteration, and because it is not the disposition of a perfect thing, since it is about an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> act, so that it has no place in a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now, in like manner, penance is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> accompanied by a bodily alteration, viz. tears, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, who says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.) that "penance consists in deploring past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>": moreover it is about <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which have no place in a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore penance is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 3), "no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is foolish." But it seems foolish to deplore what has been done in the past, since it cannot be otherwise, and yet this is what we understand by penance. Therefore penance is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are about acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because "a lawgiver intends to make the citizens <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>" (Ethic. ii, 1). But there is a precept about penance in the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse17">Matthew 4:17</a>: "Do penance," etc. Therefore penance is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Objection 2; 84, 10, ad 4), to repent is to deplore something one has done. Now it has been stated above (84, 9) that sorrow or sadness is twofold. First, it denotes a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and in this sense penance is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Secondly, it denotes an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and in this way it implies choice, and if this be right, it must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, be an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For it is stated in Ethic. ii, 6 that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of choosing according to right reason. Now it belongs to right reason than one should grieve for a proper object of grief as one ought to grieve, and for an end for which one ought to grieve. And this is observed in the penance of which we are speaking now; since the penitent assumes a moderated grief for his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of removing them. Hence it is evident that the penance of which we are speaking now, is either a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or the act of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (84, 1, ad 1; 2,3), in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> take the place of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is not the case in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and Confirmation. Wherefore, since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a principle of an act, penance is either a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or accompanies a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, rather than <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> or Confirmation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Penance, considered as a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above, and it is thus that it is accompanied by a bodily alteration. On the other hand, it is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according as it includes a right choice on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; which, however, applies to penance rather than to shame. Because shame regards the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> as present, whereas penance regards the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> as past. Now it is contrary to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that one should have an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> actually present, of which one ought to be ashamed; whereas it is not contrary to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that we should have previously committed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, of which it behooves us to repent, since a man from being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> becomes <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It would indeed be foolish to grieve for what has already been done, with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of trying to make it not done. But the penitent does not intend this: for his sorrow is displeasure or disapproval with regard to the past <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of removing its result, viz. the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the debt of punishment: and this is not foolish.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Penance is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that penance is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For it seems that to rejoice at the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> one has done, and to grieve for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one has done are acts of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> one has done is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but is a praiseworthy emotion proceeding from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7,8,9): wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 13:6</a>) that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> "rejoiceth not at <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, but rejoiceth with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Therefore, in like manner, neither is penance, which is sorrow for past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but an emotion resulting from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has its special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, because <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are distinguished by their acts, and acts by their objects. But penance has no special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, because its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> whatever. Therefore penance is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing is removed except by its contrary. But penance removes all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore it is contrary to all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and consequently is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Law has a special precept about penance, as stated above (84, 5,7).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in I-II, 54, 1, ad 1, 2, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are specifically distinguished according to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of their acts, so that whenever an act has a special reason for being praiseworthy, there must needs be a special <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now it is evident that there is a special reason for praising the act of penance, because it aims at the destruction of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, considered as an offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which does not apply to any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. We must therefore conclude that penance is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> An act springs from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in two ways: first as being elicited by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and a like <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act requires no other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, e.g. to love the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to rejoice therein, and to grieve for what is opposed to it. Secondly, an act springs from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, being, so to speak, commanded by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and thus, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> commands all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, inasmuch as it directs them to its own end, an act springing from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> may belong even to another special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Accordingly, if in the act of the penitent we consider the mere displeasure in the past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> immediately, in the same way as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for past <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> acts; but the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to aim at the destruction of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> requires a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> subordinate to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In point of fact, penance has indeed a general <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, inasmuch as it regards all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but it does so under a special aspect, inasmuch as they can be remedied by an act of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in co-operating with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for his <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> removes formally the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of the opposite <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, just as whiteness removes blackness from the same subject: but penance removes every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> effectively, inasmuch as it works for the destruction of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according as they are pardonable through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> co-operate therewith. Wherefore it does not follow that it is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the virtue of penance is a species of justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not a theological but a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as was shown in the II-II, 62, 3. But penance seems to be a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is its object, for it makes satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom, moreover, it reconciles the sinner. Therefore it seems that penance is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it observes the mean. Now penance does not observe the mean, but rather goes to the extreme, according to <a href="../bible/jer006.htm#verse26">Jeremiah 6:26</a>: "Make thee mourning as for an only son, a bitter lamentation." Therefore penance is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there are two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated in Ethic. v, 4, viz. "distributive" and "commutative." But penance does not seem to be contained under either of them. Therefore it seems that penance is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse21">Luke 6:21</a>, "Blessed are ye that weep now," says: "It is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> that teaches us the unhappiness of earthly things and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of heavenly things." But weeping is an act of penance. Therefore penance is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> rather than of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in De Poenitentia [De vera et falsa Poenitentia, the authorship of which is unknown]: "Penance is the vengeance of the sorrowful, ever punishing in them what they are sorry for having done." But to take vengeance is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, wherefore Tully says (De Inv. Rhet. ii) that one kind of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is called vindictive. Therefore it seems that penance is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 2) penance is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not merely because it sorrows for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> done (since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> would suffice for that), but also because the penitent grieves for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he has committed, inasmuch as it is an offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and purposes to amend. Now amendment for an offense committed against anyone is not made by merely ceasing to offend, but it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to make some kind of compensation, which obtains in offenses committed against another, just as retribution does, only that compensation is on the part of the offender, as when he makes satisfaction, whereas retribution is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> offended against. Each of these belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, because each is a kind of commutation. Wherefore it is evident that penance, as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p>It must be observed, however, that according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 6) a thing is said to be just in two ways, simply and relatively. A thing is just simply when it is between equals, since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a kind of equality, and he calls this the politic or civil <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, because all citizens are equal, in the point of being immediately under the ruler, retaining their freedom. But a thing is just relatively when it is between parties of whom one is subject to the other, as a servant under his master, a son under his father, a wife under her husband. It is this kind of just that we consider in penance. Wherefore the penitent has recourse to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with a purpose of amendment, as a servant to his master, according to <a href="../bible/psa122.htm#verse2">Psalm 122:2</a>: "Behold, as the eyes of servants are on the hands of their masters . . . so are our eyes unto the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, until He have mercy on us"; and as a son to his father, according to <a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse21">Luke 15:21</a>: "Father, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and before thee"; and as a wife to her husband, according to <a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse1">Jeremiah 3:1</a>: "Thou hast prostituted thyself to many lovers; nevertheless return to Me, saith the Lord."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated in Ethic. v, 1, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> towards another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not so much the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is due as the thing which is the subject of distribution or commutation. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of penance is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is offended or appeased; whereas <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is as one to whom <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is due. Wherefore it is evident that penance is not a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The mean of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the equality that is established between those between whom <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is, as stated in Ethic. v. But in certain cases perfect equality cannot be established, on account of the excellence of one, as between father and son, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. viii, 14), wherefore in such cases, he that falls short of the other must do whatever he can. Yet this will not be sufficient simply, but only according to the acceptance of the higher one; and this is what is meant by ascribing excess to penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As there is a kind of commutation in favors, when, to wit, a man gives thanks for a favor received, so also is there commutation in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of offenses, when, on account of an offense committed against another, a man is either punished against his will, which pertains to vindictive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or makes amends of his own accord, which belongs to penance, which regards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the sinner, just as vindictive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the judge. Therefore it is evident that both are comprised under commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although penance is directly a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, yet, in a fashion, it comprises things pertaining to all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; for inasmuch as there is a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it must have a share in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> pertaining to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, the object of which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently penance comprises <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, whereby we are cleansed of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, hope for pardon, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, which pertains to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Inasmuch as it is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it has a share of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which directs all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: but from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, it has not only something belonging to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but also something belonging to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, inasmuch as those things which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure, and which pertain to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and those which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> terror, which <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> moderates, are objects of commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Accordingly it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> both to abstain from pleasure, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and to bear with hardships, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the will is properly the subject of penance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the subject of penance is not properly the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For penance is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sorrow. But sorrow is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part, even as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is. Therefore penance is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, penance is a kind of vengeance, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states in De Poenitentia [De vera et falsa Poenitentia, the authorship of which is unknown]. But vengeance seems to regard the irascible faculty, since <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is the desire for vengeance. Therefore it seems that penance is in the irascible part.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the past is the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Memoria i). Now penance regards the past, as stated above (1, ad 2, ad 3). Therefore penance is subjected in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, nothing acts where it is not. Now penance removes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore penance is in every power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and not only in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Penance is a kind of sacrifice, according to <a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse19">Psalm 50:19</a>: "A sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an afflicted spirit." But to offer a sacrifice is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa053.htm#verse8">Psalm 53:8</a>: "I will freely sacrifice to Thee." Therefore penance is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We can speak of penance in two ways: first, in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, and thus, since it is a kind of sorrow, it is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part as its subject; secondly, in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and thus, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), it is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated in I-II, 56, 6, is subjected in the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore it is evident that penance, in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is subjected in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and its proper act is the purpose of amending what was committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers penance as a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To desire vengeance on another, through passion, belongs to the irascible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but to desire or take vengeance on oneself or on another, through reason, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is a power that apprehends the past. But penance belongs not to the apprehensive but to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, which presupposes an act of the apprehension. Wherefore penance is not in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, but presupposes it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The will, as stated above (I, 82, 4; I-II, 9, 1]), moves all the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; so that it is not unreasonable for penance to be subjected in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and to produce an effect in each power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether penance originates from fear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that penance does not originate from fear. For penance originates in displeasure at <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore penance originates from love rather than fear.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, men are induced to do penance, through the expectation of the heavenly kingdom, according to <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse2">Matthew 3:2</a> and <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse17">Matthew 4:17</a>: "Do penance, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand." Now the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is the object of hope. Therefore penance results from hope rather than from fear.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fear is an internal act of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But penance does not seem to arise in us through any work of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but through the operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse19">Jeremiah 31:19</a>: "After Thou didst convert me I did penance." Therefore penance does not result from fear.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse17">Isaiah 26:17</a>): "As a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with child, when she draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs, so ere we become," by penance, to wit; and according to another [the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>] version the text continues: "Through fear of Thee, O Lord, we have conceived, and been as it were in labor, and have brought forth the spirit of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>," i.e. of salutary penance, as is clear from what precedes. Therefore penance results from fear.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may speak of penance in two ways: first, as to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and then it is infused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately without our operating as principal agents, but not without our co-operating dispositively by certain acts. Secondly, we may speak of penance, with regard to the acts whereby in penance we co-operate with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> operating, the first principle [Cf. I-II, 113] of which acts is the operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in turning the heart, according to <a href="../bible/lam005.htm#verse21">Lamentations 5:21</a>: "Convert us, O Lord, to Thee, and we shall be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>"; the second, an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; the third, a movement of servile fear, whereby a man is withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through fear of punishment; the fourth, a movement of hope, whereby a man makes a purpose of amendment, in the hope of obtaining pardon; the fifth, a movement of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is displeasing to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for its own sake and no longer for the sake of the punishment; the sixth, a movement of filial fear whereby a man, of his own accord, offers to make amends to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through fear of Him.

<p>Accordingly it is evident that the act of penance results from servile fear as from the first movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in this direction and from filial fear as from its immediate and proper principle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sin begins to displease a man, especially a sinner, on account of the punishments which servile fear regards, before it displeases him on account of its being an offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or on account of its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, which pertains to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is said to be at hand, we are to understand that the king is on his way, not only to reward but also to punish. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse7">Matthew 3:7</a>): "Ye brood of vipers, who hath showed you to flee from the wrath to come?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even the movement of fear proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> act in turning the heart; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse29">Deuteronomy 5:29</a>): "Who shall give them to have such a mind, to fear Me?" And so the fact that penance results from fear does not hinder its resulting from the act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in turning the heart.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether penance is the first of the virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that penance is the first of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Because, on <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse2">Matthew 3:2</a>, "Do penance," etc., a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "The first <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is to destroy the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by means of penance."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, withdrawal from one extreme seems to precede approach to the other. Now all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> seem to regard approach to a term, because they all direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; whereas penance seems to direct him to withdraw from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore it seems that penance precedes all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, before penance, there is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is compatible with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> precedes penance, which is itself the first of all and opens the door to the others by expelling <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Penance results from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as already stated (2,5). Therefore penance is not the first of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In speaking of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, we do not consider the order of time with regard to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, because, since the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are connected with one another, as stated in I-II, 65, 1, they all begin at the same time to be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but one is said to precede the other in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which order depends on the order of their acts, in so far as the act of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> presupposes the act of another. Accordingly, then, one must say that, even in the order of time, certain praiseworthy acts can precede the act and the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of penance, e.g. acts of dead <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, and an act of servile fear; while the act and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are, in point of time, simultaneous with the act and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of penance, and with the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For, as was stated in I-II, 113, 7,8, in the justification of the ungodly, the movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and the movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is the act of penance, are simultaneous. Yet of these two acts, the former <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes the latter, because the act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance is directed against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; where the first-mentioned act is the reason and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the second.

<p>Consequently penance is not simply the first of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, either in the order of time, or in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because, in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> precede it simply. Nevertheless, in a certain respect, it is the first of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the order of time, as regards its act, because this act is the first in the justification of the ungodly; whereas in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> seem to precede, as that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> precedes that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>; because the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> seem to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by reason of their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereas penance is only <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> if something, viz. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, be presupposed, as stated above (Question 55, Article 2), when we spoke of the relation of the sacrament of penance to the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> aforesaid.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> is to be taken as meaning that the act of penance is the first in point of time, in comparison with the acts of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In successive movements withdrawal from one extreme precedes approach to the other, in point of time; and also in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, if we consider the subject, i.e. the order of the material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; but if we consider the order of the efficient and final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, approach to the end is first, for it is this that the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> intends first of all: and it is this order which we consider chiefly in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated in Phys. ii.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Penance opens the door to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, because it expels <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which precede it in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; yet it so opens the door to them that they enter at the same time as it: because, in the justification of the ungodly, at the same time as the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is moved towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is pardoned and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> infused, and with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated in I-II, 65, 3,5.
