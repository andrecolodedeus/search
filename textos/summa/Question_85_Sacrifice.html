<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether offering a sacrifice to God is of the law of nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that offering a sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. Things that are of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> are common among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Yet this is not the case with <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>: for we read of some, e.g. <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> (<a href="../bible/gen014.htm#verse18">Genesis 14:18</a>), offering bread and wine in sacrifice, and of certain animals being offered by some, and others by others. Therefore the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> is not of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, things that are of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> were observed by all just men. Yet we do not read that <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> offered sacrifice; nor that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> did so, of whom nevertheless it is written (<a href="../bible/wis010.htm#verse2">Wisdom 10:2</a>) that wisdom "brought him out of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore the offering of sacrifice is not of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x, 5,19) that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are offered in signification of something. Now words which are chief among signs, as he again says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 3), "signify, not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but by convention," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Peri Herm. i, 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are not of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> At all times and among all nations there has always been the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. Now that which is observed by all is seemingly <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Therefore the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Natural reason tells <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that he is subject to a higher being, on account of the defects which he perceives in himself, and in which he needs help and direction from someone above him: and whatever this superior being may be, it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all under the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now just as in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things the lower are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> subject to the higher, so too it is a dictate of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in accordance with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination that he should tender submission and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, according to his mode, to that which is above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now the mode befitting to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is that he should employ sensible signs in order to signify anything, because he derives his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from sensibles. Hence it is a dictate of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should use certain sensibles, by offering them to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in sign of the subjection and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to Him, like those who make certain offerings to their lord in recognition of his authority. Now this is what we mean by a sacrifice, and consequently the offering of sacrifice is of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (I-II, 95, 2), certain things belong generically to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, while their determination belongs to the positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; thus the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> requires that evildoers should be punished; but that this or that punishment should be inflicted on them is a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> determined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. On like manner the offering of sacrifice belongs generically to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, and consequently all are agreed on this point, but the determination of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> is established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and this is the reason for their difference.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and other just men offered sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a manner befitting the times in which they lived, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, who says (Moral. iv, 3) that in olden times <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> was remitted through the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. Nor does <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> mention all the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the just, but only those that have something special connected with them. Perhaps the reason why we read of no sacrifice being offered by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> may be that, as the origin of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is ascribed to him, the origin of sanctification ought not to be represented as typified in him. <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> was a type of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, being himself offered in sacrifice; and so there was no need that he should be represented as offering a sacrifice.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to express his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> by signs, but the determination of those signs depends on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> pleasure.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether sacrifice should be offered to God alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sacrifice should not be offered to the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Since sacrifice ought to be offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it would seem that it ought to be offered to all such as are partakers of the Godhead. Now <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men are made "partakers of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," according to <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse4">2 Peter 1:4</a>; wherefore of them is it written (<a href="../bible/psa081.htm#verse6">Psalm 81:6</a>): "I have said, You are gods": and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> too are called "sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," according to <a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse6">Job 1:6</a>. Thus sacrifice should be offered to all these.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the greater a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is the greater the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to him from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are far greater than any earthly princes: and yet the subjects of the latter pay them much greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, by prostrating before them, and offering them <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, than is implied by offering an animal or any other thing in sacrifice. Much more therefore may one offer sacrifice to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, temples and altars are raised for the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. Yet temples and altars are raised to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> also may be offered to them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse20">Exodus 22:20</a>): "He that sacrificeth to gods shall be put to death, save only to the Lord."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), a sacrifice is offered in order that something may be represented. Now the sacrifice that is offered outwardly represents the inward <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sacrifice, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> offers itself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to <a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse19">Psalm 50:19</a>, "A sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an afflicted spirit," since, as stated above (81, 07; 84, 2), the outward acts of religion are directed to the inward acts. Again the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> offers itself in sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its beginning by creation, and its end by beatification: and according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is the creator of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as stated in I, 90, 3; I-II, 118, 2, while in Him alone the beatitude of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> consists, as stated above (I-II, 01, 8; I-II, 2, 8; I-II, 3, 1 and 7 and 8). Wherefore just as to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone ought we to offer <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sacrifice, so too ought we to offer outward <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to Him alone: even so "in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and praises we proffer significant words to Him to Whom in our hearts we offer the things which we designate thereby," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Civ. Dei x, 19). Moreover we find that in every country the people are wont to show the sovereign ruler some special sign of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and that if this be shown to anyone else, it is a crime of high-treason. Therefore, in the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, the death punishment is assigned to those who offer Divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to another than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The name of the Godhead is communicated to certain ones, not equally with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by participation; hence neither is equal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The offering of a sacrifice is measured not by the value of the animal killed, but by its signification, for it is done in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the sovereign Ruler of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Wherefore, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x, 19), "the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> rejoice, not in the stench of corpses, but in receiving divine honors."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei viii, 19), "we do not raise temples and priesthoods to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, because not they but their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> says not: I offer sacrifice to thee, Peter or <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. But we give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for their triumphs, and urge ourselves to imitate them."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the offering of sacrifice is a special act of virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the offering of sacrifice is not a special act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x, 6): "A <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice is any work done that we may cleave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fellowship." But not every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work is a special act of some definite <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore the offering of sacrifice is not a special act of a definite <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the mortification of the body by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> belongs to abstinence, by <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Now all these things seem to be comprised in the offering of sacrifice, according to <a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans 12:1</a>, "Present your bodies a living sacrifice." Again the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse16">Hebrews 13:16</a>): "Do not forget to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to impart, for by such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> favor is obtained." Now it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, mercy and liberality to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to impart. Therefore the offering of sacrifice is not a special act of a definite <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a sacrifice is apparently anything offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now many things are offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, such as devotion, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, first-fruits, oblations, and holocausts. Therefore sacrifice does not appear to be a special act of a definite <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> contains special precepts about <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, as appears from the beginning of Leviticus.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 18, 6,7), where an act of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed to the end of another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it partakes somewhat of its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; thus when a man thieves in order to commit fornication, his <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> assumes, in a sense, the deformity of fornication, so that even though it were not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> otherwise, it would be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from the very fact that it was directed to fornication. Accordingly, sacrifice is a special act deserving of praise in that it is done out of reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and for this reason it belongs to a definite <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, viz. religion. But it happens that the acts of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are directed to the reverence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as when a man gives <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of his own things for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, or when a man subjects his own body to some affliction out of reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in this way the acts also of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> may be called <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. On the other hand there are acts that are not deserving of praise save through being done out of reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: such acts are properly called <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and belong to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The very fact that we wish to cling to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fellowship pertains to reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and consequently the act of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> assumes the character of a sacrifice through being done in order that we may cling to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fellowship.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is threefold. There is first his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a certain inward sacrifice by devotion, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and other like interior acts: and this is the principal sacrifice. The second is his body's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is, so to speak, offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and abstinence or <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>. The third is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which consists of external things: and of these we offer a sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, directly when we offer our possession to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately, and indirectly when we share them with our neighbor for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A "sacrifice," properly speaking, requires that something be done to the thing which is offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for instance animals were slain and burnt, the bread is broken, eaten, blessed. The very word signifies this, since "sacrifice" is so called because a man does something sacred [facit sacrum]. On the other hand an "oblation" is properly the offering of something to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> even if nothing be done thereto, thus we speak of offering money or bread at the altar, and yet nothing is done to them. Hence every sacrifice is an oblation, but not conversely. "First-fruits" are oblations, because they were offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/deu026.htm">Deuteronomy 26</a>, but they are not a sacrifice, because nothing sacred was done to them. "Tithes," however, are neither a sacrifice nor an oblation, properly speaking, because they are not offered immediately to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to the ministers of Divine worship.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether all are bound to offer sacrifices?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all are not bound to offer sacrifices. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse19">Romans 3:19</a>): "What things soever the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> was not given to all, but only to the Hebrew people. Therefore all are not bound to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in order to signify something. But not everyone is capable of understanding these significations. Therefore not all are bound to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> ['Sacerdotes': Those who give or administer sacred things (sacra dantes): cf. <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a> are so called because they offer sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But all are not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Therefore not all are bound to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of is of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now all are bound to do that which is of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. Therefore all are bound to offer sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sacrifice is twofold, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). The first and principal is the inward sacrifice, which all are bound to offer, since all are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to offer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a devout mind. The other is the outward sacrifice, and this again is twofold. There is a sacrifice which is deserving of praise merely through being offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in protestation of our subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of offering this sacrifice was not the same for those under the New or the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, as for those who were not under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. For those who are under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are bound to offer certain definite <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> according to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, whereas those who were not under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> were bound to perform certain outward actions in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, as became those among whom they dwelt, but not definitely to this or that action. The other outward sacrifice is when the outward actions of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are performed out of reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; some of which are a matter of precept; and to these all are bound, while others are works of supererogation, and to these all are not bound.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All were not bound to offer those particular <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which were prescribed in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: but they were bound to some <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> inward or outward, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Though all do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> explicitly the power of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it implicitly, even as they have implicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as stated above (2, 6,7).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> offer those <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which are specially directed to the Divine worship, not only for themselves but also for others. But there are other <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, which anyone can offer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for himself as explained above (A2,3).
