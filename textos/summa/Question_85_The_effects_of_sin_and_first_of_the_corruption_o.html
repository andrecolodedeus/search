<h1>Question 85. The effects of sin, and, first, of the corruption of the good of nature</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2085.htm#article1"> Is the good of nature diminished by sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2085.htm#article2"> Can it be taken away altogether?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2085.htm#article3"> The four wounds, mentioned by Bede, with which human nature is stricken in consequence of sin</a> <li><a href="../summa/2085.htm#article4"> Is privation of mode, species and order an effect of sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2085.htm#article5"> Are death and other bodily defects the result of sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2085.htm#article6"> Are they, in any way, natural to man?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether sin diminishes the good of nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not diminish the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is no worse than the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a>. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> remains unimpaired in <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore neither does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> diminish the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, when that which follows is changed, that which precedes remains unchanged, since <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> remains the same when its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are changed. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> before the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> action. Therefore, when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> a disorder in a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not changed on that account, so that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be diminished.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an action, while diminution is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Now no agent is passive by the very reason of its acting, although it is possible for it to act on one thing, and to be passive as regards another. Therefore he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, does not, by his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, diminish the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> acts on its subject: because that which is patient is a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> being, while that which is subjected to an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, is already an actual being as regards that <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in a subject. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not diminish the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since to diminish is to act.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "A certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> going down from Jerusalem to Jericho (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse30">Luke 10:30</a>), i.e. to the corruption of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, was stripped of his <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, and wounded in his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> [The quotation is from the Glossa Ordinaria of Strabo] expounds the passage. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> diminishes the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is threefold. First, there are the principles of which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is constituted, and the properties that flow from them, such as the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and so forth. Secondly, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> an inclination to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (60, 1; 63, 1), this inclination to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Thirdly, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, conferred on the whole of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, may be called a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Accordingly, the first-mentioned <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is neither destroyed nor diminished by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The third <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was entirely destroyed through the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>. But the second <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, viz. the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is diminished by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> produce an inclination to like acts, as stated above (Question 50, Article 1). Now from the very fact that thing becomes inclined to one of two contraries, its inclination to the other contrary must needs be diminished. Wherefore as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, from the very fact that a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, there results a diminution of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is the inclination to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> is speaking of the first-mentioned <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which consists in "being, living and understanding," as anyone may see who reads the context.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> precedes the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> action, it has an inclination to a certain <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> action. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not changed in itself, through a change in the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> action: it is the inclination that is changed in so far as it is directed to its term.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> action proceeds from various powers, active and passive. The result is that through <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> actions something is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> or taken away in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who acts, as we have stated when treating of the production of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> (51, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> does not act effectively on its subject, but it acts on it formally, in the same sense as when we say that whiteness makes a thing white. In this way there is nothing to hinder <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from diminishing the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but only in so far as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is itself a diminution of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, through being an inordinateness of action. But as regards the inordinateness of the agent, we must say that such like inordinateness is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the fact that in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, there is an active, and a passive element: thus the sensible object moves the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> inclines the reason and will, as stated above (77, A1, 2). The result of this is the inordinateness, not as though an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> acted on its own subject, but in so far as the object acts on the power, and one power acts on another and puts it out of order.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the entire good of human nature can be destroyed by sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the entire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be destroyed by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is finite, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself is finite. Now any finite thing is entirely taken away, if the subtraction be continuous. Since therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be continually diminished by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it seems that in the end it can be entirely taken away.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in a thing of one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the whole and the parts are uniform, as is evidently the case with air, water, flesh and all bodies with similar parts. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is wholly uniform. Since therefore a part thereof can be taken away by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it seems that the whole can also be taken away by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that is weakened by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is aptitude for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now this aptitude is destroyed entirely in some on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: thus the lost cannot be restored to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> any more than the blind can to sight. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can take away the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> entirely.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xiv) that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> except in some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, because they are contrary to it. Therefore it must be in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and consequently it does not destroy it entirely.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that is diminished by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is befitting to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the very fact that he is a rational being; for it is due to this that he performs actions in accord with reason, which is to act virtuously. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot entirely take away from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the fact that he is a rational being, for then he would no longer be capable of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore it is not possible for this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be destroyed entirely.

<p>Since, however, this same <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may be continually diminished by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, some, in order to illustrate this, have made use of the example of a finite thing being diminished indefinitely, without being entirely destroyed. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. i, text. 37) that if from a finite magnitude a continual subtraction be made in the same <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, it will at last be entirely destroyed, for instance if from any finite length I continue to subtract the length of a span. If, however, the subtraction be made each time in the same proportion, and not in the same <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, it may go on indefinitely, as, for instance, if a <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> be halved, and one half be diminished by half, it will be possible to go on thus indefinitely, provided that what is subtracted in each case be less than what was subtracted before. But this does not apply to the question at issue, since a subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not diminish the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> less than a previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but perhaps more, if it be a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>We must, therefore, explain the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> otherwise by saying that the aforesaid inclination is to be considered as a middle term between two others: for it is based on the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as on its root, and tends to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as to its term and end. Consequently its diminution may be understood in two ways: first, on the part of its rood, secondly, on the part of its term. In the first way, it is not diminished by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not diminish <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But it is diminished in the second way, in so far as an obstacle is placed against its attaining its term. Now if it were diminished in the first way, it would needs be entirely destroyed at last by the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> being entirely destroyed. Since, however, it is diminished on the part of the obstacle which is place against its attaining its term, it is evident that it can be diminished indefinitely, because obstacles can be placed indefinitely, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can go on indefinitely adding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and yet it cannot be destroyed entirely, because the root of this inclination always remains. An example of this may be seen in a transparent body, which has an inclination to receive light, from the very fact that it is transparent; yet this inclination or aptitude is diminished on the part of supervening clouds, although it always remains rooted in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection avails when diminution is made by subtraction. But here the diminution is made by raising obstacles, and this neither diminishes nor destroys the root of the inclination, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination is indeed wholly uniform: nevertheless it stands in relation both to its principle and to its term, in respect of which diversity of relation, it is diminished on the one hand, and not on the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even in the lost the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> remains, else they would have no remorse of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. That it is not reduced to act is owing to their being deprived of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Thus even in a blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the aptitude to see remains in the very root of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, inasmuch as he is an animal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> endowed with sight: yet this aptitude is not reduced to act, for the lack of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> capable of reducing it, by forming the organ requisite for sight.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether weakness, ignorance, malice and concupiscence are suitably reckoned as the wounds of nature consequent upon sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that weakness, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> are not suitably reckoned as the wounds of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> consequent upon <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For one same thing is not both effect and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the same thing. But these are reckoned to be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as appears from what has been said above (76, 1; 77, A3,5; 78, 1). Therefore they should not be reckoned as effects of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is the name of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it should have no place among the effects of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is something <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, since it is an act of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power. But that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> should not be reckoned a wound of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> should not be reckoned a wound of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it has been stated (77, 3) that to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from weakness is the same as to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from passion. But <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Therefore it should not be condivided with weakness.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Nat. et Grat. lxvii, 67) reckons "two things to be punishments inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the sinner, viz. <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and difficulty," from which arise "<a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and vexation," which four do not coincide with the four in question. Therefore it seems that one or the other reckoning is incomplete.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The authority of Bede suffices [Reference not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>].

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As a result of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the reason had perfect hold over the lower parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, while reason itself was perfected by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was subject to Him. Now this same original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> was forfeited through the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, as already stated (81, 2); so that all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are left, as it were, destitute of their proper order, whereby they are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> directed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; which destitution is called a wounding of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Again, there are four of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers that can be subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (Question 61, Article 2), viz. the reason, where <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> resides, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, where <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is, the irascible, the subject of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, the subject of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Therefore in so far as the reason is deprived of its order to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, there is the wound of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; in so far as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is deprived of its order of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, there is the wound of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>; in so far as the irascible is deprived of its order to the arduous, there is the wound of weakness; and in so far as the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> is deprived of its order to the delectable, moderated by reason, there is the wound of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<p>Accordingly these are the four wounds inflicted on the whole of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as a result of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But since the inclination to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is diminished in each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> on account of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as was explained above (Question 1, Article 2), these four wounds are also the result of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in so far as, through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the reason is obscured, especially in practical matters, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> hardened to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions become more difficult and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> more impetuous.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is no reason why the effect of one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should not be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another: because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> once, is more easily inclined to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> again.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Malice is not to be taken here as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but as a certain proneness of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, according to the words of <a href="../bible/gen008.htm#verse21">Genesis 8:21</a>: "Man's senses are prone to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from his youth" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'The <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and thought of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart are prone to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from his youth.'].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (82, 3, ad 1), <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in so far as it is subject to reason: whereas, in so far as it is goes beyond the bounds of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it is unnatural to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Speaking in a general way, every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> can be called a weakness, in so far as it weakens the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> strength and clogs the reason. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, however, took weakness in the strict sense, as contrary to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> which pertains to the irascible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The "difficulty" which is mentioned in this book of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, includes the three wounds affecting the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers, viz. "<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>," "weakness" and "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>," for it is owing to these three that a man finds it difficult to tend to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. "<a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">Error</a>" and "vexation" are consequent wounds, since a man is vexed through being weakened in respect of the objects of his <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether privation of mode, species and order is the effect of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that privation of mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Natura Boni iii) that "where these three abound, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is great; where they are less, there is less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; where they are not, there is no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> at all." But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not destroy the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it does not destroy mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing is its own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself is the "privation of mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Natura Boni iv). Therefore privation of mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, different effects result from different <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now since mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order are diverse, their corresponding privations must be diverse also, and, consequently, must be the result of different <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore privation of mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order is not the effect of each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Sin is to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> what weakness is to the body, according to <a href="../bible/psa006.htm#verse3">Psalm 6:3</a>, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak." Now weakness deprives the body of mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in the I, 5, 5, mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order are consequent upon every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as such, and also upon every being. Because every being and every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as such depends on its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> from which it derives its "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>." Again, any kind of form, whether <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, of anything whatever, is according to some measure, wherefore it is stated in Metaph. viii, that "the forms of things are like numbers," so that a form has a certain "mode" corresponding to its measure. Lastly owing to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, each thing has a relation of "order" to something else.

<p>Accordingly there are different grades of mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order, corresponding to the different degrees of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For there is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> belonging to the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has its mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order, and is neither destroyed nor diminished by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. There is again the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination, which also has its mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order; and this is diminished by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (1,2), but is not entirely destroyed. Again, there is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: this too has its mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order, and is entirely taken away by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Lastly, there is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consisting in the ordinate act itself, which also has its mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order, the privation of which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence it is clear both how <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is privation of mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order, and how it destroys or diminishes mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the first two Objections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order follow one from the other, as explained above: and so they are destroyed or diminished together.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether death and other bodily defects are the result of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that death and other bodily defects are not the result of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Because equal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> have equal effects. Now these defects are not equal in all, but abound in some more than in others, whereas <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, from which especially these defects seem to result, is equal in all, as stated above (Question 82, Article 4). Therefore death and suchlike defects are not the result of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is removed, the effect is removed. But these defects are not removed, when all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is removed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> or Penance. Therefore they are not the effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has more of the character of guilt than <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> has. But actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not change the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body by subjecting it to some defect. Much less, therefore, does <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Therefore death and other bodily defects are not the result of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>), "By one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into this world, and by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> death."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> One thing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> another in two ways: first, by reason of itself; secondly, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. By reason of itself, one thing is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another, if it produces its effect by reason of the power of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or form, the result being that the effect is directly intended by the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Consequently, as death and such like defects are beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the sinner, it is evident that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not, of itself, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these defects. Accidentally, one thing is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another if it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> it by removing an obstacle: thus it is stated in Phys. viii, text. 32, that "by displacing a pillar a man moves <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> the stone resting thereon." In this way the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of death and all such like defects in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in so far as by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> was taken away, whereby not only were the lower powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> held together under the control of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, without any disorder whatever, but also the whole body was held together in subjection to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, without any defect, as stated in the I, 97, 1. Wherefore, original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> being forfeited through the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>; just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was stricken in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the disorder among the powers, as stated above (3; 82, 3), so also it became subject to corruption, by reason of disorder in the body.

<p>Now the withdrawal of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has the character of punishment, even as the withdrawal of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has. Consequently, death and all consequent bodily defects are punishments of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. And although the defects are not intended by the sinner, nevertheless they are ordered according to the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who inflicts them as punishments.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Causes that produce their effects of themselves, if equal, produce equal effects: for if such <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> be increased or diminished, the effect is increased or diminished. But equal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of an obstacle being removed, do not point to equal effects. For supposing a man employs equal force in displacing two columns, it does not follow that the movements of the stones resting on them will be equal; but that one will move with greater velocity, which has the greater weight according to the property of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to which it is left when the obstacle to its falling is removed. Accordingly, when original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is removed, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is left to itself, so that according to diverse <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> temperaments, some men's bodies are subject to more defects, some to fewer, although <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is equal in all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Both original and actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are removed by the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that removes these defects, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans 8:11</a>): "He . . . shall quicken . . . your mortal bodies, because of His Spirit that dwelleth in you": but each is done according to the order of Divine wisdom, at a fitting time. Because it is right that we should first of all be conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sufferings, before attaining to the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and impassibility of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which was begun in Him, and by Him acquired for us. Hence it behooves that our bodies should remain, for a time, subject to suffering, in order that we may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the impassibility of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in conformity with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Two things may be considered in actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, and the aspect of fault. As regards the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a bodily defect: thus some sicken and die through eating too much. But as regards the fault, it deprives us of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is given to us that we may regulate the acts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but not that we may ward off defects of the body, as original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> did. Wherefore actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> those defects, as <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> does.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether death and other defects are natural to man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that death and such like defects are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For "the corruptible and the incorruptible differ generically" (Metaph. x, text. 26). But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is of the same genus as other animals which are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> corruptible. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> corruptible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is composed of contraries is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> corruptible, as having within itself the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of corruption. But such is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> corruptible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a hot thing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> consumes moisture. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life is preserved by hot and moist elements. Since therefore the vital functions are fulfilled by the action of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat, as stated in De Anima ii, text. 50, it seems that death and such like defects are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> (1) <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whatever is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to him. Now "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made not death" (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse13">Wisdom 1:13</a>). Therefore death is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>(2) Further, that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> cannot be called either a punishment or an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: since what is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to a thing is suitable to it. But death and such like defects are the punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). Therefore they are not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>(3) Further, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is proportionate to form, and everything to its end. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> end is everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as stated above (2, 7; 5, A3,4): and the form of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the I, 75, 6. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> incorruptible.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may speak of any corruptible thing in two ways; first, in respect of its universal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, secondly, as regards its particular <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. A thing's particular <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is its own power of action and self-preservation. And in respect of this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, every corruption and defect is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated in De Coelo ii, text. 37, since this power tends to the being and preservation of the thing to which it belongs.

<p>On the other hand, the universal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is an active force in some universal principle of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for instance in some heavenly body; or again belonging to some superior <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, in which sense <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said by some to be "the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> Who makes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." This force intends the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, for which alternate generation and corruption in things are requisite: and in this respect corruption and defect in things are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, not indeed as regards the inclination of the form which is the principle of being and perfection, but as regards the inclination of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which is allotted proportionately to its particular form according to the discretion of the universal agent. And although every form intends perpetual being as far as it can, yet no form of a corruptible being can achieve its own perpetuity, except the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for the reason that the latter is not entirely subject to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as other forms are; indeed it has an immaterial operation of its own, as stated in the I, 75, 2. Consequently as regards his form, incorruption is more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than to other corruptible things. But since that very form has a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> composed of contraries, from the inclination of that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> there results corruptibility in the whole. In this respect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> corruptible as regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> left to itself, but not as regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his form.

<p>The first three objections argue on the side of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; while the other three argue on the side of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Wherefore in order to solve them, we must observe that the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> which is the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in respect of its incorruptibility is adapted to its end, which is everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: whereas the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, which is corruptible, considered in respect of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is, in a way, adapted to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and, in another way, it is not. For we may note a twofold <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> in any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, one which the agent chooses, and another which is not chosen by the agent, and is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Thus, a smith in order to make a knife, chooses a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> both hard and flexible, which can be sharpened so as to be useful for cutting, and in respect of this <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> iron is a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> adapted for a knife: but that iron be breakable and inclined to rust, results from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition of iron, nor does the workman choose this in the iron, indeed he would do without it if he could: wherefore this disposition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not adapted to the workman's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, nor to the purpose of his art. In like manner the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> chosen by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in respect of its being of a mixed temperament, in order that it may be most suitable as an organ of touch and of the other sensitive and motive powers. Whereas the fact that it is corruptible is due to a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and is not chosen by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: indeed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would choose an incorruptible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> if it could. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is subject, in forming <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> supplied the defect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, gave the body a certain incorruptibility, as was stated in the I, 97, 1. It is in this sense that it is said that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made not death," and that death is the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.
