<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether our intellect understands corporeal and material things by abstraction from phantasms?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not understand corporeal and material things by abstraction from the phantasms. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> if it understands an object otherwise than as it really is. Now the forms of material things do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> as abstracted from the particular things represented by the phantasms. Therefore, if we understand material things by abstraction of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the phantasm, there will be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, material things are those <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things which include <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in their definition. But nothing can be understood apart from that which enters into its definition. Therefore material things cannot be understood apart from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the principle of individualization. Therefore material things cannot be understood by abstraction of the universal from the particular, which is the process whereby the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is abstracted from the phantasm.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 7) that the phantasm is to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> what color is to the sight. But seeing is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by abstraction of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from color, but by color impressing itself on the sight. Therefore neither does the act of understanding take place by abstraction of something from the phantasm, but by the phantasm impressing itself on the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 5) there are two things in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But it does not belong to the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to abstract the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the phantasm, but to receive them when abstracted. Neither does it seem to be the function of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is related to the phantasm, as light is to color; since light does not abstract anything from color, but rather streams on to it. Therefore in no way do we understand by abstraction from phantasms.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, 7) says that "the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the phantasm"; and not, therefore, by <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 4) that "things are intelligible in proportion as they are separate from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>." Therefore material things must needs be understood according as they are abstracted from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and from material images, namely, phantasms.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 84, Article 7), the object of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is proportionate to the power of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now there are three grades of the cognitive powers. For one cognitive power, namely, the sense, is the act of a corporeal organ. And therefore the object of every sensitive power is a form as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. And since such <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the principle of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a>, therefore every power of the sensitive part can only have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. There is another grade of cognitive power which is neither the act of a corporeal organ, nor in any way connected with corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; such is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the object of whose cognitive power is therefore a form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> apart from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: for though <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> material things, yet they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them save in something immaterial, namely, either in themselves or in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> holds a middle place: for it is not the act of an organ; yet it is a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is the form the body, as is clear from what we have said above (Question 76, Article 1). And therefore it is proper to it to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> individually in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but not as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in this <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in such <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, is to abstract the form from <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which is represented by the phantasms. Therefore we must needs say that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands material things by abstracting from the phantasms; and through material things thus considered we acquire some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of immaterial things, just as, on the contrary, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> material things through the immaterial.

<p>But <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, considering only the immateriality of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and not its being in a way united to the body, held that the objects of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are separate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; and that we understand not by <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>, but by participating things <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, as stated above (84, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Abstraction may occur in two ways:

<p>First, by way of composition and division; thus we may understand that one thing does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in some other, or that it is separate therefrom.

<p>Secondly, by way of simple and absolute consideration; thus we understand one thing without considering the other. Thus for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to abstract one from another things which are not really abstract from one another, does, in the first mode of <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>, imply falsehood. But, in the second mode of <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to abstract things which are not really abstract from one another, does not involve falsehood, as clearly appears in the case of the senses. For if we understood or said that color is not in a colored body, or that it is separate from it, there would be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in this opinion or assertion. But if we consider color and its properties, without reference to the apple which is colored; or if we express in word what we thus understand, there is no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in such an opinion or assertion, because an apple is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to color, and therefore color can be understood independently of the apple. Likewise, the things which belong to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a material thing, such as a stone, or a man, or a horse, can be thought of apart from the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individualizing</a> principles which do not belong to the notion of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. This is what we mean by abstracting the universal from the particular, or the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the phantasm; that is, by considering the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> apart from its <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> represented by the phantasms. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> when it understands a thing otherwise than as it is, that is so, if the word "otherwise" refers to the thing understood; for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> when it understands a thing otherwise than as it is; and so the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> would be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> if it abstracted the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a stone from its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in such a way as to regard the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> held. But it is not so, if the word "otherwise" be taken as referring to the one who understands. For it is quite <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the mode of understanding, in one who understands, is not the same as the mode of a thing in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>: since the thing understood is immaterially in the one who understands, according to the mode of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and not materially, according to the mode of a material thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Some have thought that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing is a form only, and that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not part of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. If that were so, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> would not enter into the definition of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things. Therefore it must be said otherwise, that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is twofold, common, and "signate" or <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>; common, such as flesh and bone; and <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, as this flesh and these bones. The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> therefore abstracts the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing from the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but not from the common sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; for example, it abstracts the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from "this flesh and these bones," which do not belong to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as such, but to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> (Metaph. vii, Did. vi, 10), and need not be considered in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: whereas the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be abstracted by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> form "flesh and bones."

<p>Mathematical <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, however, can be abstracted by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, not only from <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but also from common <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; not from common intelligible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but only from <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as subject to sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, such as being cold or hot, hard or soft, and the like: while intelligible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> as subject to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Now it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> before other sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> are. Hence <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantities</a>, such as number, dimension, and figures, which are the terminations of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, can be considered apart from sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>; and this is to abstract them from sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; but they cannot be considered without understanding the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> which is subject to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; for that would be to abstract them from common intelligible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Yet they can be considered apart from this or that <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; for that is to abstract them from <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> intelligible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But some things can be abstracted even from common intelligible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, such as "being," "unity," "power," "act," and the like; all these can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as is plain regarding immaterial things. Because <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> failed to consider the twofold kind of <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>, as above explained (ad 1), he held that all those things which we have stated to be abstracted by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, are abstract in reality.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Colors, as being in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, have the same mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as the power of sight: therefore they can impress their own image on the eye. But phantasms, since they are images of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in corporeal organs, have not the same mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and therefore have not the power of themselves to make an impression on the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. This is done by the power of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which by turning towards the phantasm produces in the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> a certain likeness which represents, as to its specific <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> only, the thing reflected in the phantasm. It is thus that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is said to be abstracted from the phantasm; not that the identical form which previously was in the phantasm is subsequently in the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as a body transferred from one place to another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Not only does the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> throw light on the phantasm: it does more; by its own power it abstracts the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the phantasm. It throws light on the phantasm, because, just as the sensitive part acquires a greater power by its conjunction with the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part, so by the power of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> the phantasms are made more fit for the abstraction therefrom of intelligible intentions. Furthermore, the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> abstracts the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the phantasm, forasmuch as by the power of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> we are able to disregard the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a>, and to take into our consideration the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the image of which informs the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> both abstracts the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the phantasms, inasmuch as it considers the natures of things in universal, and, nevertheless, understands these natures in the phantasms since it cannot understand even the things of which it abstracts the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, without turning to the phantasms, as we have said above (Question 84, Article 7).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the intelligible species abstracted from the phantasm is related to our intellect as that which is understood?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> abstracted from the phantasm is related to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as that which is understood. For the understood in act is in the one who understands: since the understood in act is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself in act. But nothing of what is understood is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> actually understanding, save the abstracted intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is what is actually understood.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is actually understood must be in something; else it would be nothing. But it is not in something outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for, since what is outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is material, nothing therein can be actually understood. Therefore what is actually understood is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Consequently it can be nothing else than the aforesaid intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (1 Peri Herm. i) that "words are signs of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." But words signify the things understood, for we express by word what we understand. Therefore these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--viz. the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, are what is actually understood.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> what the sensible image is to the sense. But the sensible image is not what is perceived, but rather that by which sense perceives. Therefore the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is not what is actually understood, but that by which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have asserted that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> faculties <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only the impression made on them; as, for example, that sense is cognizant only of the impression made on its own organ. According to this theory, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands only its own impression, namely, the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which it has received, so that this <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is what is understood.

<p>This is, however, manifestly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> for two reasons.

<p>First, because the things we understand are the objects of science; therefore if what we understand is merely the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it would follow that every science would not be concerned with objects outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but only with the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> within the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; thus, according to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> all science is about <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, which they held to be actually understood [84, 1].

<p>Secondly, it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, because it would lead to the opinion of the ancients who maintained that "whatever seems, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>" [Aristotle, Metaph. iii. 5, and that consequently contradictories are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> simultaneously. For if the faculty <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> its own impression only, it can judge of that only. Now a thing seems according to the impression made on the cognitive faculty. Consequently the cognitive faculty will always judge of its own impression as such; and so every judgment will be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: for instance, if taste perceived only its own impression, when anyone with a healthy taste perceives that honey is sweet, he would judge <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>; and if anyone with a corrupt taste perceives that honey is bitter, this would be equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for each would judge according to the impression on his taste. Thus every opinion would be equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; in fact, every sort of apprehension.

<p>Therefore it must be said that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is related to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as that by which it understands: which is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> thus. There is a twofold action (Metaph. ix, Did. viii, 8), one which remains in the agent; for instance, to see and to understand; and another which passes into an external object; for instance, to heat and to cut; and each of these actions proceeds in virtue of some form. And as the form from which proceeds an act tending to something external is the likeness of the object of the action, as heat in the heater is a likeness of the thing heated; so the form from which proceeds an action remaining in the agent is the likeness of the object. Hence that by which the sight sees is the likeness of the visible thing; and the likeness of the thing understood, that is, the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is the form by which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands. But since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> reflects upon itself, by such reflection it understands both its own act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by which it understands. Thus the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is that which is understood secondarily; but that which is primarily understood is the object, of which the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is the likeness. This also appears from the opinion of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who said that "like is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by like." For they said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the earth outside itself, by the earth within itself; and so of the rest. If, therefore, we take the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the earth instead of the earth, according to <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Anima iii, 8), who says "that a stone is not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but only the likeness of the stone"; it follows that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> external things by means of its intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The thing understood is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by its own likeness; and it is in this sense that we say that the thing actually understood is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act, because the likeness of the thing understood is the form of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as the likeness of a sensible thing is the form of the sense in act. Hence it does not follow that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> abstracted is what is actually understood; but rather that it is the likeness thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In these words "the thing actually understood" there is a double implication--the thing which is understood, and the fact that it is understood. In like manner the words "abstract universal" imply two things, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing and its abstraction or universality. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself to which it occurs to be understood, abstracted or considered as universal is only in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>; but that it is understood, abstracted or considered as universal is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. We see something similar to this is in the senses. For the sight sees the color of the apple apart from its smell. If therefore it be asked where is the color which is seen apart from the smell, it is quite clear that the color which is seen is only in the apple: but that it be perceived apart from the smell, this is owing to the sight, forasmuch as the faculty of sight receives the likeness of color and not of smell. In like manner humanity understood is only in this or that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; but that humanity be apprehended without <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a>, that is, that it be abstracted and consequently considered as universal, occurs to humanity inasmuch as it is brought under the consideration of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in which there is a likeness of the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but not of the principles of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There are two operations in the sensitive part. One, in regard of impression only, and thus the operation of the senses takes place by the senses being impressed by the sensible. The other is formation, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> forms for itself an image of an absent thing, or even of something never seen. Both of these operations are found in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For in the first place there is the passion of the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as informed by the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and then the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> thus informed forms a definition, or a division, or a composition, expressed by a word. Wherefore the concept conveyed by a word is its definition; and a proposition conveys the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect's</a> division or composition. Words do not therefore signify the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> themselves; but that which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> forms for itself for the purpose of judging of external things.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the more universal is first in our intellectual cognition?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the more universal is not first in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> cognition. For what is first and more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is secondarily and less <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in relation to ourselves. But universals come first as regards their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because "that is first which does not involve the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of its correlative" (Categor. ix). Therefore the universals are secondarily <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as regards our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the composition precedes the simple in relation to us. But universals are the more simple. Therefore they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> secondarily by us.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. i, 1), that the object defined comes in our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> before the parts of its definition. But the more universal is part of the definition of the less universal, as "animal" is part of the definition of "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore the universals are secondarily <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> and principles by their effects. But universals are principles. Therefore universals are secondarily <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "We must proceed from the universal to the singular and <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>" (Phys. i, 1)

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> there are two things to be considered.

<p>First, that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in some degree arises from sensible <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: and, because sense has singular and <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> things for its object, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has the universal for its object, it follows that our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the former comes before our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the latter.

<p>Secondly, we must consider that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> proceeds from a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to a state of <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>; and every power thus proceeding from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> comes first to an incomplete act, which is the medium between <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, before accomplishing the perfect act. The perfect act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is complete <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, when the object is distinctly and determinately <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; whereas the incomplete act is imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, when the object is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> indistinctly, and as it were confusedly. A thing thus imperfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> partly in act and partly in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, and hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. i, 1), that "what is manifest and certain is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us at first confusedly; afterwards we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it by distinguishing its principles and elements." Now it is evident that to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> an object that comprises many things, without proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of each thing contained in it, is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thing confusedly. In this way we can have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> not only of the universal whole, which contains parts <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>, but also of the integral whole; for each whole can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> confusedly, without its parts being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> distinctly what is contained in the universal whole is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the less common, as to "animal" indistinctly is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it as "animal"; whereas to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> "animal" distinctly is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it as "rational" or "irrational animal," that is, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a man or a lion: therefore our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> "animal" before it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and the same reason holds in comparing any more universal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> with the less universal.

<p>Moreover, as sense, like the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, proceeds from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, the same order of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> appears in the senses. For by sense we judge of the more common before the less common, in reference both to place and time; in reference to place, when a thing is seen afar off it is seen to be a body before it is seen to be an animal; and to be an animal before it is seen to be a man, and to be a man before it seen to be <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> or <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>; and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as regards time, for a child can distinguish <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before he distinguishes this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from that, and therefore "children at first call men fathers, and later on distinguish each one from the others" (Phys. i, 1). The reason of this is clear: because he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a thing indistinctly is in a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> as regards its principle of distinction; as he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> "genus" is in a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> as regards "difference." Thus it is evident that indistinct <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is midway between <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and act.

<p>We must therefore conclude that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the singular and <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is prior, as regards us, to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the universal; as sensible <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is prior to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But in both sense and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the more common precedes the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the less common.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The universal can be considered in two ways.

<p>First, the universal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may be considered together with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of universality. And since the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of universality--viz. the relation of one and the same to many--is due to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>, the universal thus considered is a secondary consideration. Hence it is said (De Anima i, 1) that the "universal animal is either nothing or something secondary." But according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who held that universals are subsistent, the universal considered thus would be prior to the particular, for the latter, according to him, are mere participations of the subsistent universals which he called <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<p>Secondly, the universal can be considered in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself--for instance, animality or humanity as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. And thus we must distinguish two orders of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: one, by way of generation and time; and thus the imperfect and the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> come first. In this way the more common comes first in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as appears clearly in the generation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and animal; for "the animal is generated before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Gener. Animal ii, 3). The other order is the order of perfection or of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: for instance, act considered absolutely is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, and the perfect to the imperfect: thus the less common comes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> before the more common; as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> comes before animal. For the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not stop at the generation of animal but goes on to the generation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The more common universal may be compared to the less common, as the whole, and as the part. As the whole, considering that in the more universal is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> contained not only the less universal, but also other things, as in "animal" is contained not only "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" but also "horse." As part, considering that the less common contains in its <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> not only the more common, but also more; as "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" contains not only "animal" but also "rational." Therefore "animal" in itself comes into our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> before "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>"; but "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" comes before "animal" considered as part of the same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A part can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in two ways.

<p>First, absolutely considered in itself; and thus nothing prevents the parts being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> before the whole, as stones are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> before a house is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<p>Secondly as belonging to a certain whole; and thus we must needs <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the whole before its parts. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a house vaguely before we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its different parts. So likewise principles of definition are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> before the thing defined is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; otherwise the thing defined would not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at all. But as parts of the definition they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> after. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> vaguely as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to distinguish all that belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The universal, as understood with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of universality, is, indeed, in a way, a principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of universality results from the mode of understanding by way of <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>. But what is a principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> a principle of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> thought: since at times we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> through its effect, and <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> through <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. Wherefore the universal thus considered, according to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, is neither a principle of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, nor a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as he makes clear (Metaph. vii, Did. vi, 13). But if we consider the generic or specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the singular, thus in a way it is in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a formal principle in regard to the singulars: for the singular is the result of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is from the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But the generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is compared to the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> rather after the fashion of a material principle, because the generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is taken from that which is material in a thing, while the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is taken from that which is formal: thus the notion of animal is taken from the sensitive part, whereas the notion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is taken from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part. Thus it is that the ultimate <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and not to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, or the genus: because the form is the end of generation, while <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Neither is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that, as regards us, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or principle should be secondary: since at times through sensible <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> we become acquainted with unknown effects, and sometimes conversely.

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we can understand many things at the same time. For <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is above time, whereas the succession of before and after belongs to time. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not understand different things in succession, but at the same time.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is nothing to prevent different forms not opposed to each other from actually being in the same subject, as, for instance, color and smell are in the apple. But intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are not opposed to each other. Therefore there is nothing to prevent the same <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> being in act as regards different intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and thus it can understand many things at the same time.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands a whole at the same time, such as a man or a house. But a whole contains many parts. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands many things at the same time.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the difference between two things unless we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both at the same time (De Anima iii, 2), and the same is to be said of any other comparison. But our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the difference and comparison between one thing and another. Therefore it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> many things at the same time.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (Topic. ii, 10) that "understanding is of one thing only, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is of many."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can, indeed, understand many things as one, but not as many: that is to say by "one" but not by "many" intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For the mode of every action follows the form which is the principle of that action. Therefore whatever things the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can understand under one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it can understand at the same time: hence it is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees all things at the same time, because He sees all in one, that is, in His Essence. But whatever things the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands under different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it does not understand at the same time. The reason of this is that it is impossible for one and the same subject to be perfected at the same time by many forms of one genus and diverse <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, just as it is impossible for one and the same body at the same time to have different colors or different shapes. Now all intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> belong to one genus, because they are the perfections of one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> faculty: although the things which the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> represent belong to different genera. Therefore it is impossible for one and the same <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to be perfected at the same time by different intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> so as actually to understand different things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is above that time, which is the measure of the movement of corporeal things. But the multitude itself of intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a certain vicissitude of intelligible operations, according as one operation succeeds another. And this vicissitude is called time by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, who says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 20,22), that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature through time."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not only is it impossible for opposite forms to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> at the same time in the same subject, but neither can any forms belonging to the same genus, although they be not opposed to one another, as is clear from the examples of colors and shapes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Parts can be understood in two ways.

<p>First, in a confused way, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the whole, and thus they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through the one form of the whole, and so are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> together. In another way they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> distinctly: thus each is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and so they are not understood at the same time.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> sees the difference or comparison between one thing and another, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> both in relation to their difference or comparison; <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, as we have said above (ad 3), as it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the parts in the whole.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether our intellect understands by composition and division?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not understand by composition and division. For composition and division are only of many; whereas the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot understand many things at the same time. Therefore it cannot understand by composition and division.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every composition and division implies past, present, or future time. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> abstracts from time, as also from other <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not understand by composition and division.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands things by a process of assimilation to them. But composition and division are not in things, for nothing is in things but what is signified by the predicate and the subject, and which is one and the same, provided that the composition be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, for "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> what "animal" is. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not act by composition and division.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Words signify the conceptions of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Peri Herm. i). But in words we find composition and division, as appears in affirmative and negative propositions. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> acts by composition and division.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> understand by composition and division. For since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> passes from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, it has a likeness to things which are generated, which do not attain to perfection all at once but acquire it by degrees: so likewise the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not acquire perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by the first act of apprehension; but it first apprehends something about its object, such as its quiddity, and this is its first and proper object; and then it understands the properties, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, and the various relations of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Thus it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> compares one thing with another by composition or division; and from one composition and division it proceeds to another, which is the process of reasoning.

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> and the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, like all incorruptible things, have their perfection at once from the beginning. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> and the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> have the entire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a thing at once and perfectly; and hence also in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the quiddity of a thing they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> at once whatever we can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by composition, division, and reasoning. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by composition, division and reasoning. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, indeed, composition, division, and reasoning, not by the process itself, but by understanding the simple <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Composition and division of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are made by differentiating and comparing. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> many things by composition and division, as by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the difference and comparison of things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> abstracts from the phantasms, it does not understand actually without turning to the phantasms, as we have said (1; 84, 7). And forasmuch as it turns to the phantasms, composition and division of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> involve time.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The likeness of a thing is received into the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> according to the mode of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, not according to the mode of the thing. Wherefore something on the part of the thing corresponds to the composition and division of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; but it does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the same way in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and in the thing. For the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the quiddity of a material thing, which comes under the action of the senses and the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Now in a material thing there is a twofold composition.

<p>First, there is the composition of form with <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and to this corresponds that composition of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> whereby the universal whole is predicated of its part: for the genus is derived from common <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, while the difference that completes the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is derived from the form, and the particular from <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. The second comparison is of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> with subject: and to this real composition corresponds that composition of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is predicated of subject, as when we say "the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is white." Nevertheless composition of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> differs from composition of things; for in the latter the things are diverse, whereas composition of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a sign of the identity of the components. For the above composition of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not imply that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" and "whiteness" are identical, but the assertion, "the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is white," means that "the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is something having whiteness": and the subject, which is a man, is identified with a subject having whiteness. It is the same with the composition of form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: for animal signifies that which has a sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; rational, that which has an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that which has both; and <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> that which has all these things together with <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and according to this kind of identity our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> predicates the composition of one thing with another.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the intellect can be false?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. vi, Did. v, 4) that "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and falsehood are in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are the same, as is shown above (Question 79, Article 1). Therefore falsehood may be in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, opinion and reasoning belong to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But falsehood <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in both. Therefore falsehood can be in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> faculty. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> involves falsehood: for "those <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> that work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>" (<a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse22">Proverbs 14:22</a>). Therefore falsehood can be in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 32), that "everyone who is deceived, does not rightly understand that wherein he is deceived." And the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 10), that "the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, 6) compares <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> with sense on this point. For sense is not deceived in its proper object, as sight in regard to color; has <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> through some hindrance occurring to the sensile organ--for example, the taste of a fever-stricken <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> judges a sweet thing to be bitter, through his tongue being vitiated by ill humors. Sense, however, may be deceived as regards common sensible objects, as size or figure; when, for example, it judges the sun to be only a foot in diameter, whereas in reality it exceeds the earth in size. Much more is sense deceived concerning <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> sensible objects, as when it judges that vinegar is honey by reason of the color being the same. The reason of this is evident; for every faculty, as such, is "per se" directed to its proper object; and things of this kind are always the same. Hence, as long as the faculty <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, its judgment concerning its own proper object does not fail. Now the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the "quiddity" of a material thing; and hence, properly speaking, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not at fault concerning this quiddity; whereas it may go astray as regards the surroundings of the thing in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or quiddity, in referring one thing to another, as regards composition or division, or also in the process of reasoning. Therefore, also in regard to those propositions, which are understood, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, as in the case of first principles from which arises <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of scientific conclusions.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, however, may be <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> deceived in the quiddity of composite things, not by the defect of its organ, for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a faculty that is independent of an organ; but on the part of the composition affecting the definition, when, for instance, the definition of a thing is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in relation to something else, as the definition of a circle applied to a triangle; or when a definition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in itself as involving the composition of things incompatible; as, for instance, to describe anything as "a rational winged animal." Hence as regards simple objects not subject to composite definitions we cannot be deceived unless, indeed, we understand nothing whatever about them, as is said Metaph. ix, Did. viii, 10.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that falsehood is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in regard to composition and division. The same answer applies to the Second Objection concerning opinion and reasoning, and to the Third Objection, concerning the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the sinner, who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> in the practical judgment of the appetible object. But in the absolute consideration of the quiddity of a thing, and of those things which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> thereby, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is never deceived. In this sense are to be understood the authorities quoted in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the opposite conclusion.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether one person can understand one and the same thing better than another can?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot understand one and the same thing better than another can. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 32), "Whoever understands a thing otherwise than as it is, does not understand it at all. Hence it is clear that there is a perfect understanding, than which none other is more perfect: and therefore there are not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> degrees of understanding a thing: nor can one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> understand a thing better than another can."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in its act of understanding. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, being a certain equality between thought and thing, is not subject to more or less; for a thing cannot be said to be more or less equal. Therefore a thing cannot be more or less understood.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the most formal of all that is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But different forms <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore if one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> understands better than another, it would seem that they do not belong to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Experience shows that some understand more profoundly than do others; as one who carries a conclusion to its first principles and ultimate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> understands it better than the one who reduces it only to its proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing being understood more by one than by another may be taken in two senses.

<p>First, so that the word "more" be taken as determining the act of understanding as regards the thing understood; and thus, one cannot understand the same thing more than another, because to understand it otherwise than as it is, either better or worse, would entail being deceived, and such a one would not understand it, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> argues (QQ. 83, qu. 32). In another sense the word "more" can be taken as determining the act of understanding on the part of him who understands; and so one may understand the same thing better than someone else, through having a greater power of understanding: just as a man may see a thing better with his bodily sight, whose power is greater, and whose sight is more perfect. The same applies to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in two ways.

<p>First, as regards the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself, which is more perfect. For it is plain that the better the disposition of a body, the better the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> allotted to it; which clearly appears in things of different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: and the reason thereof is that act and form are received into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> according to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter's</a> capacity: thus because some men have bodies of better disposition, their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have a greater power of understanding, wherefore it is said (De Anima ii, 9), that "it is to be observed that those who have soft flesh are of apt mind."

<p>Secondly, this occurs in regard to the lower powers of which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has need in its operation: for those in whom the imaginative, cogitative, and memorative powers are of better disposition, are better disposed to understand.

<p>The reply to the First Objection is clear from the above; likewise the reply to the

<p>Second, for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understanding a thing as it is.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The difference of form which is due only to the different disposition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> not a specific but only a numerical difference: for different <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> have different forms, diversified according to the difference of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the intellect understands the indivisible before the divisible?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands the indivisible before the divisible. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. i, 1) that "we understand and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of principles and elements." But principles are indivisible, and elements are of divisible things. Therefore the indivisible is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us before the divisible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the definition of a thing contains what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> previously, for a definition "proceeds from the first and more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>," as is said Topic. vi, 4. But the indivisible is part of the definition of the divisible; as a point comes into the definition of a line; for as Euclid says, "a line is length without breadth, the extremities of which are points"; also unity comes into the definition of number, for "number is multitude measured by one," as is said Metaph. x, Did. ix, 6. Therefore our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands the indivisible before the divisible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "Like is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by like." But the indivisible is more like to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> than is the divisible; because "the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is simple" (De Anima iii, 4). Therefore our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the indivisible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (De Anima iii, 6) that "the indivisible is expressed as a privation." But privation is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> secondarily. Therefore likewise is the indivisible.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The object of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in its present state is the quiddity of a material thing, which it abstracts from the phantasms, as above stated (84, 7). And since that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> first and of itself by our cognitive power is its proper object, we must consider its relationship to that quiddity in order to discover in what order the indivisible is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Now the indivisible is threefold, as is said De Anima iii, 6.

<p>First, the continuous is indivisible, since actually it is undivided, although <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> divisible: and this indivisible is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us before its division, which is a division into parts: because confused <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is prior to distinct <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as we have said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>).

<p>Secondly, the indivisible is so called in relation to <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason is something indivisible. This way, also, the indivisible is understood before its division into <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> parts, as we have said above (De Anima iii, 6); and again before the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> disposes and divides by affirmation and negation. The reason of this is that both these kinds of indivisible are understood by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of itself, as being its proper object. The third kind of indivisible is what is altogether indivisible, as a point and unity, which cannot be divided either actually or <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. And this indivisible is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> secondarily, through the privation of divisibility. Wherefore a point is defined by way of privation "as that which has no parts"; and in like manner the notion of "one" is that is "indivisible," as stated in Metaph. x, Did. ix, 1. And the reason of this is that this indivisible has a certain opposition to a corporeal being, the quiddity of which is the primary and proper object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>But if our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understood by participation of certain separate indivisible (forms), as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> maintained, it would follow that a like indivisible is understood primarily; for according to the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> what is first is first participated by things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, principles and elements are not always (<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>) first: for sometimes from sensible effects we arrive at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of principles and intelligible <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. But in perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of effects always depends on the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of principles and elements: for as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in the same passage: "Then do we consider that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, when we can resolve principles into their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A point is not included in the definition of a line in general: for it is manifest that in a line of indefinite length, and in a circular line, there is no point, save <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. Euclid defines a finite straight line: and therefore he mentions a point in the definition, as the limit in the definition of that which is limited. Unity is the measure of number: wherefore it is included in the definition of a measured number. But it is not included in the definition of the divisible, but rather conversely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The likeness through which we understand is the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the knower; therefore a thing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> first, not on account of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> likeness to the cognitive power, but on account of the power's aptitude for the object: otherwise sight would perceive hearing rather than color.
