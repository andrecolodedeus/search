<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether all sins are taken away by Penance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are taken away by Penance. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse17">Hebrews 12:17</a>) that <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> "found no place of repentance, although with tears he had sought it," which a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains as meaning that "he found no place of pardon and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> through Penance": and it is related (<a href="../bible/2ma009.htm#verse13">2 Maccabees 9:13</a>) of Antiochus, that "this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the Lord, of Whom he was not to obtain mercy." Therefore it does not seem that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are taken away by Penance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i) that "so great is the stain of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (namely, when a man, after coming to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, resists fraternal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and by the brands of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> combats <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself) that he is unable to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> himself in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, although he is forced by his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to acknowledge and confess his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore not every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be taken away by Penance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew 12:32</a>): "He that shall speak against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the world to come." Therefore not every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be pardoned through Penance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse22">Ezekiel 18:22</a>): "I will not remember" any more "all his iniquities that he hath done."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The fact that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be taken away by Penance may happen in two ways: first, because of the impossibility of repenting of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; secondly, because of Penance being unable to blot out a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In the first way the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are lost, cannot be blotted out by Penance, because their <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is confirmed in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot displease them as to its guilt, but only as to the punishment which they suffer, by reason of which they have a kind of repentance, which yet is fruitless, according to <a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse3">Wisdom 5:3</a>: "Repenting, and groaning for anguish of spirit." Consequently such Penance brings no hope of pardon, but only <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>. Nevertheless no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a wayfarer can be such as that, because his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is flexible to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Wherefore to say that in this life there is any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which one cannot repent, is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, first, because this would destroy <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, secondly, because this would be derogatory to the power of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby the heart of any sinner whatsoever can be moved to repent, according to <a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse1">Proverbs 21:1</a>: "The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord: whithersoever He will He shall turn it."

<p>It is also <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> to say that any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be pardoned through <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Penance. First, because this is contrary to Divine mercy, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse13">Joel 2:13</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is "gracious and merciful, patient, and rich in mercy, and ready to repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>"; for, in a manner, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would be overcome by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wished a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be blotted out, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were unwilling to blot out. Secondly, because this would be derogatory to the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, through which Penance produces its effect, as do the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, since it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse2">1 John 2:2</a>): "He is the propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world."

<p>Therefore we must say simply that, in this life, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be blotted out by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> did not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> repent. This is evident from his saying (<a href="../bible/gen027.htm#verse41">Genesis 27:41</a>): "The days will come of the mourning of my father, and I will kill my brother <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>." Likewise neither did Antiochus repent <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>; since he grieved for his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not because he had offended <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> thereby, but on account of the sickness which he suffered in his body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> should be understood thus: "So great is the stain of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is unable to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> himself in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>," i.e. it is not easy for him to do so; in which sense we say that a man cannot be healed, when it is difficult to heal him. Yet this is possible by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which sometimes turns men even "into the depths of the sea" (<a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse23">Psalm 67:23</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The word or <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> spoken against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is final impenitence, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Verb. Dom. xi), which is altogether unpardonable, because after this life is ended, there is no pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. or, if by the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, we understand <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, this means either that the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> itself against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is unpardonable, i.e. not easily pardonable, or that such a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not contain in itself any motive for pardon, or that for such a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> a man is punished both in this and in the next world, as we explained in the II-II, 14, 3.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether sin can be pardoned without Penance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be pardoned without Penance. For the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is no less with regard to adults than with regard to children. But He pardons the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of children without Penance. Therefore He also pardons adults without penance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not bind His power to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But Penance is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be pardoned without Penance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy is greater than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sometimes forgives another for offending him, without his repenting: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> commanded us (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew 5:44</a>): "Love your enemies, do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you." Much more, therefore, does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pardon men for offending him, without their repenting.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Lord said (<a href="../bible/jer018.htm#verse8">Jeremiah 18:8</a>): "If that nation . . . shall repent of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>" which they have done, "I also will repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I have thought to do them," so that, on the other hand, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "do not penance," it seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not pardon him his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for a mortal actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be pardoned without penance, if we speak of penance as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For, as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He pardons <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the same way as he pardons an offense committed against Him. Now an offense is directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be offended with another, because he excludes him from his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now, as stated in I-II, 110, 1, the difference between the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is that the latter does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but presupposes <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in him who is graced, whereas the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is graced, because the good-will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is denoted by the word "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>," is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence it is possible for a man to pardon an offense, for which he is offended with someone, without any change in the latter's will; but it is impossible that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pardon a man for an offense, without his will being changed. Now the offense of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is due to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will being turned away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through being turned to some mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently, for the pardon of this offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will to be so changed as to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to renounce having turned to something else in the aforesaid manner, together with a purpose of amendment; all of which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of penance as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it is impossible for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be pardoned anyone without penance as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, as stated above (Question 88, Article 3), is perfected by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office of binding and loosing, without which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, even as Christ pardoned the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, as related in <a href="../bible/joh008.htm">John 8</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that was a sinner, as related in Luke vii, whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, however, He did not forgive without the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance: for as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states (Hom. xxxiii in Evang.), "He drew inwardly by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>," i.e. by penance, "her whom He received outwardly by His mercy."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In children there is none but <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, which consists, not in an actual disorder of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but in a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> disorder of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as explained in I-II, 82, 1, and so in them the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is accompanied by a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> change resulting from the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but not by an actual change. On the other hand, in the case of an adult, in whom there are actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which consist in an actual disorder of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, there is no remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, even in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, without an actual change of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the effect of Penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument takes Penance as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy is more powerful than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>, in that it moves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will to repent, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mercy cannot do.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether by Penance one sin can be pardoned without another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that by Penance one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be pardoned without another. For it is written (<a href="../bible/amo004.htm#verse7">Amos 4:7</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> it to rain upon one city, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> it not to rain upon another city; one piece was rained upon: and the piece whereupon I rained not, withered." These words are expounded by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, who says (Hom. x super Ezech.): "When a man who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his neighbor, breaks himself of other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, rain falls on one part of the city, leaving the other part withered, for there are some men who, when they prune some <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, become much more rooted in others." Therefore one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be forgiven by Penance, without another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> in commenting on <a href="../bible/psa118.htm">Psalm 118</a>, "Blessed are the undefiled in the way," after expounding <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse136">verse 136</a> ("My eyes have sent forth springs of water"), says that "the first consolation is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is mindful to have mercy; and the second, that He punishes, for although <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be wanting, punishment makes satisfaction and raises us up." Therefore a man can be raised up from one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief remains.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when several things are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> together, one can be removed without the other. Now it was stated in I-II, 73, 1 that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not connected together, so that one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be without another. Therefore also one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be taken away by Penance without another being taken away.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are the debts, for which we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for pardon when we say in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>: "Forgive us our trespasses," etc. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sometimes forgives one debt without forgiving another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also, by Penance, forgives one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without another.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven him through the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse3">Jeremiah 31:3</a>: "I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore have I drawn thee, taking pity on thee." Now there is nothing to hinder <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> a man in one respect, while being offended with him in another, even as He loves the sinner as regards his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, while hating him for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it seems possible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by Penance, to pardon one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in De Poenitentia [De vera et falsa Poenitentia, the authorship of which is unknown]: "There are many who repent having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, but not completely; for they except certain things which give them pleasure, forgetting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> delivered from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was both dumb and deaf, whereby He shows us that we are never healed unless it be from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for Penance to take one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> away without another. First because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is taken away by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> removing the offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore it was stated in I-II, 109, 7; I-II, 113, 2 that without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be forgiven. Now every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and excludes it. Therefore it is impossible for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be pardoned without another. Secondly, because, as shown above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be forgiven without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Penance, to which it belongs to renounce <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by reason of its being against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is common to all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and where the same reason applies, the result will be the same. Consequently a man cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> penitent, if he repent of one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and not of another. For if one particular <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were displeasing to him, because it is against the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things (which motive is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> repentance), it follows that he would repent of all. Whence it follows that it is impossible for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be pardoned through Penance, without another. Thirdly, because this would be contrary to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy, since His works are perfect, as stated in <a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; wherefore whomsoever He pardons, He pardons altogether. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says [De vera et falsa Poenitentia, the authorship of which is unknown, that "it is irreverent and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> to expect half a pardon from Him Who is just and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> itself."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> do not refer to the forgiveness of the guilt, but to the cessation from act, because sometimes a man who has been wont to commit several kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, renounces one and not the other; which is indeed due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> assistance, but does not reach to the pardon of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In this saying of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" cannot denote the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse22">John 15:22</a>, "If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (viz. unbelief): "for this is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which contains all others": but it stands for consciousness, because sometimes a man receives pardon for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which he is not conscious, through the punishment which he bears patiently.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not connected in so far as they turn towards a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, yet they are connected in so far as they turn away from the immutable Good, which applies to all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in common. and it is thus that they have the character of an offense which needs to be removed by Penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Debt as regards external things, e.g. money, is not opposed to friendship through which the debt is pardoned. hence one debt can be condoned without another. On the other hand, the debt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to friendship, and so one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or offense is not pardoned without another; for it would seem absurd for anyone to ask even a man to forgive him one offense and not another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The love whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, does not ordain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is excluded by any mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. but the love of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven, ordains <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to eternal life, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (is) life everlasting." Hence there is no comparison.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the debt of punishment remains after the guilt has been forgiven through Penance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no debt of punishment remains after the guilt has been forgiven through Penance. For when the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is removed, the effect is removed. But the guilt is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the debt of punishment: since a man deserves to be punished because he has been guilty of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been forgiven, no debt of punishment can remain.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm">Romans 5</a>) the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is more effective than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. Now, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> incurs at the same time guilt and the debt of punishment. Much more therefore, by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, is the guilt forgiven and at the same time the debt of punishment remitted.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is effected in Penance through the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse25">Romans 3:25</a>: "Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed to be a propitiation, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His Blood . . . for the remission of former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> made satisfaction sufficient for all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as stated above (Q48,49,79, 5). Therefore after the guilt has been pardoned, no debt of punishment remains.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is related (<a href="../bible/2sa012.htm#verse13">2 Samuel 12:13</a>) that when David penitent had said to Nathan: "I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the Lord," Nathan said to him: "The Lord also hath taken away thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, thou shalt not die. Nevertheless . . . the child that is born to thee shall surely die," which was to punish him for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he had committed, as stated in the same place. Therefore a debt of some punishment remains after the guilt has been forgiven.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in I-II, 87, 4, in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> there are two things, namely, a turning from the immutable Good, and an inordinate turning to mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Accordingly, in so far as mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> turns away from the immutable Good, it induces a debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, so that whosoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Good should be punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>. Again, in so far as mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> turns inordinately to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it gives rise to a debt of some punishment, because the disorder of guilt is not brought back to the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, except by punishment: since it is just that he who has been too indulgent to his will, should suffer something against his will, for thus will equality be restored. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rev018.htm#verse7">Apocalypse 18:7</a>): "As much as she hath glorified herself, and lived in delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye to her."

<p>Since, however, the turning to mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is finite, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not, in this respect, induce a debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>. Wherefore, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turns inordinately to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, without turning from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as happens in venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he incurs a debt, not of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> but of temporal punishment. Consequently when guilt is pardoned through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ceases to be turned away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through being united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: so that at the same time, the debt of punishment is taken away, albeit a debt of some temporal punishment may yet remain.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> both turns away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and turns to a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But, as stated in I-II, 71, 6, the turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> while the turning to <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is as its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now if the formal element of anything be removed, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is taken away: thus, if you take away rational, you take away the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Consequently mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is said to be pardoned from the very fact that, by means of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the aversion of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is taken away together with the debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>: and yet the material element remains, viz. the inordinate turning to a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for which a debt of temporal punishment is due.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated in I-II, 109, 7,8; I-II, 111, 2, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to operate in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by justifying him from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and to co-operate with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that his work may be rightly done. Consequently the forgiveness of guilt and of the debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> belongs to operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, while the remission of the debt of temporal punishment belongs to co-operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by bearing punishment patiently with the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, is released also from the debt of temporal punishment. Consequently just as the effect of operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> precedes the effect of co-operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so too, the remission of guilt and of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> precedes the complete release from temporal punishment, since both are from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but the former, from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> alone, the latter, from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is of itself sufficient to remove all debt of punishment, not only <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but also temporal; and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is released from the debt of punishment according to the measure of his share in the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. Now in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shares the Power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> fully, since by water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he dies with Him to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and is born again in Him to a new life, so that, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives the remission of all debt of punishment. In Penance, on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shares in the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> according to the measure of his own acts, which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of Penance, as water is of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as stated above (84, 1,3). Wherefore the entire debt of punishment is not remitted at once after the first act of Penance, by which act the guilt is remitted, but only when all the acts of Penance have been completed.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the remnants of sin are removed when a mortal sin is forgiven?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all the remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are removed when a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in De Poenitentia [De vera et falsa Poenitentia, the authorship of which is unknown]: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> never healed anyone without delivering him wholly; for He wholly healed the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the Sabbath, since He delivered his body from all disease, and his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from all taint." Now the remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> belong to the disease of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it does not seem possible for any remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to remain when the guilt has been pardoned.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv), "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is more efficacious than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does not act save in virtue of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Now, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> incurs the taint of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> all at once. Much more, therefore, by repenting, is he delivered also from all remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> work is more efficacious than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>. Now by the exercise of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> works the remnants of contrary <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are removed. Much more, therefore, are they taken away by the remission of guilt, which is a work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We read (<a href="../bible/mar008.htm">Mark 8</a>) that the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> enlightened, was restored first of all to imperfect sight, wherefore he said (<a href="../bible/mar008.htm#verse24">Mark 8:24</a>): "I see men, as it were trees, walking"; and afterwards he was restored perfectly, "so that he saw all things clearly." Now the enlightenment of the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> signifies the delivery of the sinner. Therefore after the first remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereby the sinner is restored to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sight, there still remain in him some remnants of his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as it turns inordinately to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, produces in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a certain disposition, or even a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, if the acts be repeated frequently. Now it has been said above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>) that the guilt of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is pardoned through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> removing the aversion of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nevertheless when that which is on the part of the aversion has been taken away by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that which is on the part of the inordinate turning to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> can remain, since this may happen to be without the other, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Consequently, there is no reason why, after the guilt has been forgiven, the dispositions <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by preceding acts should not remain, which are called the remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet they remain weakened and diminished, so as not to domineer over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and they are after the manner of dispositions rather than of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, like the "fomes" which remains after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> heals the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> perfectly; but sometimes suddenly, as Peter's mother-in-<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was restored at once to perfect health, so that "rising she ministered to them" (<a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse39">Luke 4:39</a>), and sometimes by degrees, as we said above (44, 3, ad 2) about the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was restored to sight (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm">Matthew 8</a>). And so too, He sometimes turns the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with such power, that it receives at once perfect <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> health, not only the guilt being pardoned, but all remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being removed as was the case with <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalen</a> (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm">Luke 7</a>); whereas at other times He sometimes first pardons the guilt by operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and afterwards, by co-operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, removes the remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by degrees.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sin too, sometimes induces at once a weak disposition, such as is the result of one act, and sometimes a stronger disposition, the result of many acts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> does not remove all the remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because, as stated in the Predicaments (Categor. viii) "a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works will make but little progress so as to be any better, but if he continue in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> practice, he will end in being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as to acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does this much more effectively, whether by one or by several acts.

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the forgiveness of guilt is not an effect of penance as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For penance is said to be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as it is a principle of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action does nothing towards the remission of guilt, since this is an effect of operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore the forgiveness of guilt is not an effect of penance as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, certain other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are more excellent than penance. But the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not said to be the effect of any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Neither, therefore, is it the effect of penance as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there is no forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> except through the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse22">Hebrews 9:22</a>: "Without shedding of blood there is no remission." Now Penance, as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, produces its effect through the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, even as the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> do, as was shown above (62, 4,5). Therefore the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the effect of Penance, not as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Properly speaking, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a thing is that without which it cannot be, since every defect depends on its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, but not without the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance, as stated above (84, 5, ad 3; 85, 2); so that, even before the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> were instituted, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pardoned the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the penitent. Therefore the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is chiefly the effect of penance as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Penance is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in so far as it is a principle of certain <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, which are performed by the sinner, are the material element in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>. Moreover every sacrament produces its effect, in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not only of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but also of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. because both these together make the one sacrament, as stated above (60, 6, ad 2, 7). Hence in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is effected, in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not only of the form (but also of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, viz. water, albeit chiefly in virtue of the form) [The words in brackets are omitted in the Leonine edition] from which the water receives its power--and, similarly, the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the effect of Penance, chiefly by the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, which is vested in the ministers, who furnish the formal part of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (Question 84, Article 3), and secondarily by the instrumentality of those acts of the penitent which pertain to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance, but only in so far as such acts are, in some way, subordinate to the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Accordingly it is evident that the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the effect of penance as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but still more of Penance as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The effect of operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the justification of the ungodly (as stated in I-II, 113), wherein there is, as was there stated (1,2,3), not only infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also a movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and a movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is the act of penance. Yet these <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are there as the effects of operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and are produced at the same time as the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not take place without an act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance, although it is the effect of operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the justification of the ungodly there is not only an act of penance, but also an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as stated above (ad 1: I-II, 113, 4). Wherefore the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is accounted the effect not only of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance, but also, and that chiefly, of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance is subordinate to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> both by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and by its relation to the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and so, in both ways, it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p>To the argument advanced in the contrary sense we reply that the act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through being an inseparable effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby chiefly is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> pardoned, and which produces its effect in all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Consequently it only follows that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>. Moreover, it must be observed that, under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, there was a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of Penance after a fashion, as stated above (84, 7, ad 2).
