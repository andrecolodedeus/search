<h1>Question 86. The stain of sin</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2086.htm#article1"> Is an effect of sin a stain on the soul?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2086.htm#article2"> Does it remain in the soul after the act of sin?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether sin causes a stain on the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> no stain on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For a higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be defiled by contact with a lower <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: hence the sun's ray is not defiled by contact with tainted bodies, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Quinque Haereses v). Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of a much higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> than mutable things, to which it turns by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Therefore it does not contract a stain from them by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (74, A1,2). Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in the reason, as stated in De Anima iii, text. 42. But the reason or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not stained by considering anything whatever; rather indeed is it perfected thereby. Therefore neither is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> stained by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a stain, this stain is either something positive, or a pure privation. If it be something positive, it can only be either a disposition or a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: for it seems that nothing else can be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an act. But it is neither disposition nor <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: for it happens that a stain remains even after the removal of a disposition or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; for instance, in a man who after committing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of prodigality, is so changed as to fall into a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the opposite <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Therefore the stain does not denote anything positive in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Again, neither is it a pure privation. Because all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> agree on the part of aversion and privation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: and so it would follow that there is but one stain <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore the stain is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It was said to Solomon (<a href="../bible/sir047.htm#verse22">Sirach 47:22</a>): "Thou hast stained thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>": and it is written (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse27">Ephesians 5:27</a>): "That He might present it to Himself a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> church not having spot or wrinkle": and in each case it is question of the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore a stain is the effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A stain is properly ascribed to corporeal things, when a comely body loses its comeliness through contact with another body, e.g. a garment, gold or silver, or the like. Accordingly a stain is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things in like manner. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has a twofold comeliness; one from the refulgence of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whereby he is directed in his actions; the other, from the refulgence of the Divine light, viz. of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is also perfected for the purpose of doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and fitting actions. Now, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cleaves to things by love, there is a kind of contact in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he cleaves to certain things, against the light of reason and of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, as shown above (Question 71, Article 6). Wherefore the loss of comeliness occasioned by this contact, is metaphorically called a stain on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not defiled by inferior things, by their own power, as though they acted on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: on the contrary, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by its own action, defiles itself, through cleaving to them inordinately, against the light of reason and of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is accomplished by the intelligible thing being in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, according to the mode of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not defiled, but perfected, by them. On the other hand, the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> consists in a movement towards things themselves, so that love attaches the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the thing loved. Thus it is that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is stained, when it cleaves inordinately, according to <a href="../bible/hos009.htm#verse10">Hosea 9:10</a>: "They . . . became abominable as those things were which they loved."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The stain is neither something positive in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nor does it denote a pure privation: it denotes a privation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> brightness in relation to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; wherefore diverse <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> occasion diverse stains. It is like a shadow, which is the privation of light through the interposition of a body, and which varies according to the diversity of the interposed bodies.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the stain remains in the soul after the act of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the stain does not remain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For after an action, nothing remains in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> except <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or disposition. But the stain is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or disposition, as stated above (1, Objection 3). Therefore the stain does not remain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the stain is to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> what the shadow is to the body, as stated above (1, ad 3). But the shadow does not remain when the body has passed by. Therefore the stain does not remain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is past.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every effect depends on its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the stain is the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore when the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is no longer there, neither is the stain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jos022.htm#verse17">Joshua 22:17</a>): "Is it a small thing to you that you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> with <a href="../cathen/02388b.htm">Beelphegor</a>, and the stain of that crime remaineth in you [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'us'] to this day?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> remains in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> even when the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is past. The reason for this is that the stain, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), denotes a blemish in the brightness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, on account of its withdrawing from the light of reason or of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. And therefore so long as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> remains out of this light, the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> remains in him: but as soon as, moved by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he returns to the Divine light and to the light of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, the stain is removed. For although the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> ceases, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> withdrew from the light of reason and of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not at once return to the state in which he was before, and it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that his will should have a movement contrary to the previous movement. Thus if one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be parted from another on account of some kind of movement, he is not reunited to him as soon as the movement ceases, but he needs to draw nigh to him and to return by a contrary movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Nothing positive remains in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except the disposition or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; but there does remain something private, viz. the privation of union with the Divine light.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> After the interposed body has passed by, the transparent body remains in the same position and relation as regards the illuminating body, and so the shadow passes at once. But when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is past, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not remain in the same relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and so there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> parts <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which parting <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the defect of brightness, just as local movement <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> local parting. Wherefore, just as when movement ceases, local distance is not removed, so neither, when the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> ceases, is the stain removed.
