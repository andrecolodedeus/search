<h1>Question 86. What our intellect knows in material things</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1086.htm#article1"> Does it know singulars?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1086.htm#article2"> Does it know the infinite?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1086.htm#article3"> Does it know contingent things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1086.htm#article4"> Does it know future things?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether our intellect knows singulars?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> singulars. For whoever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> composition, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the terms of composition. But our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> this composition; "<a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> is a man": for it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to form a proposition. Therefore our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> this singular, <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> directs to action. But action has relation to singular things. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the singular.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands itself. But in itself it is a singular, otherwise it would have no action of its own; for actions belong to singulars. Therefore our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> singulars.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a superior power can do whatever is done by an inferior power. But sense <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the singular. Much more, therefore, can the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. i, 5), that "the universal is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by reason; and the singular is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by sense."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the singular in material things directly and primarily. The reason of this is that the principle of singularity in material things is <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, whereas our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as have said above (Question 85, Article 1), understands by abstracting the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from such <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now what is abstracted from <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the universal. Hence our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> directly the universal only. But indirectly, and as it were by a kind of reflection, it can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the singular, because, as we have said above (Question 85, Article 7), even after abstracting the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in order to understand, needs to turn to the phantasms in which it understands the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as is said De Anima iii, 7. Therefore it understands the universal directly through the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and indirectly the singular represented by the phantasm. And thus it forms the proposition "<a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> is a man." Wherefore the reply to the first objection is clear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The choice of a particular thing to be done is as the conclusion of a syllogism formed by the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as is said Ethic. vii, 3. But a singular proposition cannot be directly concluded from a universal proposition, except through the medium of a singular proposition. Therefore the universal principle of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not move save through the medium of the particular apprehension of the sensitive part, as is said De Anima iii, 11.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Intelligibility is incompatible with the singular not as such, but as material, for nothing can be understood otherwise than immaterially. Therefore if there be an immaterial singular such as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, there is no reason why it should not be intelligible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The higher power can do what the lower power can, but in a more eminent way. Wherefore what the sense <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> materially and concretely, which is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the singular directly, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> immaterially and in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, which is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the universal.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether our intellect can know the infinite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> excels all <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things. But our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as we have said above (Question 12, Article 1). Much more, therefore, can our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all other <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> "genera" and "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>." But there is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in some genera, as in number, proportion, and figure. Therefore our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if one body can coexist with another in the same place, there is nothing to prevent an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of bodies being in one place. But one intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> with another in the same <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, for many things can be <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at the same time. Therefore our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can have an <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of things.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not a corporeal faculty, as we have said (76, 1), it appears to be an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power. But an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power has a capacity for an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> object. Therefore our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (Phys. i, 4) that "the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, considered as such, is unknown."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since a faculty and its object are proportional to each other, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> must be related to the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, as is its object, which is the quiddity of a material thing. Now in material things the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> actually, but only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>, in the sense of one succeeding another, as is said Phys. iii, 6. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> through its considering successively one thing after another: because never does our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understand so many things, that it cannot understand more. On the other hand, our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot understand the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> either actually or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>. Not actually, for our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> actually at the same time, except what it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> through one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is not represented by one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, for if it were it would be something whole and complete. Consequently it cannot be understood except by a successive consideration of one part after another, as is clear from its definition (Phys. iii, 6): for the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is that "from which, however much we may take, there always remains something to be taken." Thus the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> could not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> actually, unless all its parts were counted: which is impossible.

<p>For the same reason we cannot have <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>: because in us <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> results from actual consideration: since by understanding we acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as is said Ethic. ii, 1. Wherefore it would not be possible for us to have a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of things distinctly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, unless we had already considered the entire <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> thereof, counting them according to the succession of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: which is impossible. And therefore neither actually nor <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> can our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, but only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As we have said above (Question 7, Article 1), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, because He is a form unlimited by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; whereas in material things, the term '<a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>' is applied to that which is deprived of any formal term. And form being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in itself, whereas <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> without form, it follows that the material <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is in itself unknowable. But the formal <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is of Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; but He is unknown to us by reason of our feeble <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which in its present state has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude for material objects only. Therefore we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in our present life except through material effects. In the future life this defect of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will be removed by the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, when we shall be able to see the Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, but without being able to comprehend Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> abstracted from phantasms; therefore it cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> actually or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of numbers or figures that are not in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, except in a general way and in their universal principles; and this is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> and confusedly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If two or more bodies were in the same place, there would be no need for them to occupy the place successively, in order for the things placed to be counted according to this succession of occupation. On the other hand, the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> enter into our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> successively; since many things cannot be actually understood at the same time: and therefore there must be a definite and not an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in power, so does it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. For its power is indeed <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> inasmuch as it is not terminated by corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Moreover it can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the universal, which is abstracted from <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and which consequently is not limited to one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but, considered in itself, extends to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether our intellect can know contingent things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> contingent things: because, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 6), the objects of understanding, wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are not <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>, but <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as stated in Phys. iv, 12, "what sometimes is and sometimes is not, is measured by <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> abstracts from time, and from other material <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. Therefore, as it is proper to a contingent thing sometime to be and sometime not to be, it seems that contingent things are not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> All <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But some <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are of the contingent things, as the <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral sciences</a>, the objects of which are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions subject to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; and again, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> in as far as they relate to things generated and corruptible. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> contingent things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">Contingent</a> things can be considered in two ways; either as <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>, or as containing some element of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, since every contingent thing has in it something <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>: for example, that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> runs, is in itself <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>; but the relation of running to motion is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> move if he runs. Now contingency arises from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, for contingency is a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to be or not to be, and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; whereas <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> results from form, because whatever is consequent on form is of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> in the subject. But <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individualizing</a> principle: whereas the universal comes from the abstraction of the form from the particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Moreover it was laid down above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of itself and directly has the universal for its object; while the object of sense is the singular, which in a certain way is the indirect object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as we have said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>, considered as such, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> directly by sense and indirectly by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; while the universal and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> principles of contingent things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence if we consider the objects of science in their universal principles, then all science is of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things. But if we consider the things themselves, thus some <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things, some of contingent things.

<p>From which the replies to the objections are clear.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether our intellect can know the future?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the future. For our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by means of intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> abstracted from the "here" and "now," and related indifferently to all time. But it can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the present. Therefore it can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, while his senses are in suspense, can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> some future things, as in sleep, and in frenzy. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is freer and more vigorous when removed from sense. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is superior to any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of brutes. But some animals <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future; thus crows by their frequent cawing foretell rain. Therefore much more can the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/ecc008.htm#verse6">Ecclesiastes 8:6-7</a>), "There is a great affliction for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of things past; and things to come he cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by any messenger."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must apply the same distinction to future things, as we applied above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>) to contingent things. For future things considered as subject to time are singular, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them by reflection only, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But the principles of future things may be universal; and thus they may enter the domain of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and become the objects of science.

<p>Speaking, however, of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future in a general way, we must observe that the future may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in two ways: either in itself, or in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. The future cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in itself save by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone; to Whom even that is present which in the course of events is future, forasmuch as from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> His glance embraces the whole course of time, as we have said above when treating of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (14, 13). But forasmuch as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the future can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us also. And if, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be such as to have a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connection with its future result, then the future is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> with scientific <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> foresees the future eclipse. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be such as to produce a certain result more frequently than not, then can the future be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> more or less conjecturally, according as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is more or less inclined to produce the effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is drawn from universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> principles; from these the future may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, according to the order of the effects to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. xii [Gen. ad lit. xii. 13), the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has a certain power of forecasting, so that by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future; hence when withdrawn from corporeal sense, and, as it were, concentrated on itself, it shares in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future. Such an opinion would be reasonable if we were to admit that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receives <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by participating the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> maintained, because in that case the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of all effects, and would only be impeded in its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by the body, and hence when withdrawn from the corporeal senses it would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future.

<p>But since it is connatural to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things, not thus, but by receiving its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from the senses; it is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future when withdrawn from the senses: rather does it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future by the impression of superior <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and corporeal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, when by Divine power the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is enlightened through the ministry of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and the phantasms are directed to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of future events; or, by the influence of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is moved regarding the future <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, as explained above (Question 57, Article 3). The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> more inclined to receive these impressions of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> when it is withdrawn from the senses, as it is then nearer to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> world, and freer from external distractions. The same may also come from superior corporeal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. For it is clear that superior bodies influence inferior bodies. Hence, in consequence of the sensitive faculties being acts of corporeal organs, the influence of the heavenly bodies <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> to be affected, and so, as the heavenly bodies <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> many future events, the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> receives certain images of some such events. These images are perceived more at night and while we sleep than in the daytime and while we are awake, because, as stated in De Somn. et Vigil. ii [De Divinat. per somn. ii.], "impressions made by day are evanescent. The night air is calmer, when silence reigns, hence bodily impressions are made in sleep, when slight internal movements are felt more than in wakefulness, and such movements produce in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> images from which the future may be foreseen."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Brute animals have no power above the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> wherewith to regulate it, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and therefore their <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> follows entirely the influence of the heavenly bodies. Thus from such animals' movements some future things, such as rain and the like, may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> rather from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> movements directed by reason. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Somn. et Vig.), that "some who are most imprudent are most far-seeing; for their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is not burdened with cares, but is as it were barren and bare of all anxiety moving at the caprice of whatever is brought to bear on it."
