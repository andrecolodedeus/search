<h1>Question 87. How the intellectual soul knows itself and all within itself</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1087.htm#article1"> Does the soul know itself by its own essence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1087.htm#article2"> Does it know its own habits?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1087.htm#article3"> How does the intellect know its own act?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1087.htm#article4"> How does it know the act of the will?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the intellectual soul knows itself by its essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself by its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ix, 3), that "the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself, because it is incorporeal."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> belong to the genus of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> understands itself by its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore likewise does the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "in things void of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and that which is understood are the same" (De Anima iii, 4). But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is void of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, not being the act of a body as stated above (Question 76, Article 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and its object are the same in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind; and therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind understands itself by its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (De Anima iii, 4) that "the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands itself in the same way as it understands other things." But it understands other things, not by their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but by their similitudes. Therefore it does not understand itself by its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Everything is knowable so far as it is in act, and not, so far as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> (Metaph. ix, Did. viii, 9): for a thing is a being, and is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and therefore knowable, according as it is actual. This is quite clear as regards sensible things, for the eye does not see what is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>, but what is actually colored. In like manner it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, so far as it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> material things, does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> save what is in act: and hence it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> except as proportionate to form, as is stated Phys. i, 7. Consequently immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are intelligible by their own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> according as each one is actual by its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p>Therefore it is that the Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the pure and perfect act, is simply and perfectly in itself intelligible; and hence <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by His own Essence <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Himself, and all other things also. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> belongs, indeed, to the genus of intelligible things as "act," but not as a "<a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>," nor as a "complete act," and hence the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is not completed by his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For although an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> understands himself by his own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, still he cannot understand all other things by his own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things other than himself by their likenesses. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is only a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in the genus of intelligible beings, just as primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> as regards sensible beings; and hence it is called "possible" [Possibilis--elsewhere in this translation rendered "passive"--Ed.]. Therefore in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> understanding. Hence it has in itself the power to understand, but not to be understood, except as it is made actual. For even the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> asserted than an order of intelligible beings <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> above the order of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>, forasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands only by participation of the intelligible; for they said that the participator is below what it participates. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> held, became actual by participating separate intelligible forms, it would understand itself by such participation of incorporeal beings. But as in this life our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has material and sensible things for its proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> object, as stated above (Question 84, Article 7), it understands itself according as it is made actual by the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> abstracted from sensible things, through the light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which not only actuates the intelligible things themselves, but also, by their instrumentality, actuates the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself not by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but by its act. This happens in two ways: In the first place, singularly, as when <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> or <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> perceives that he has an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> because he perceives that he understands. In the second place, universally, as when we consider the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> act. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, however, that the judgment and force of this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, comes to us according to the derivation of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light from the Divine Truth which contains the types of all things as above stated (84, 5). Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ix, 6): "We gaze on the inviolable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whence we can as perfectly as possible define, not what each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind is, but what it ought to be in the light of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types." There is, however, a difference between these two kinds of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and it consists in this, that the mere presence of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> suffices for the first; the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> itself being the principle of action whereby it perceives itself, and hence it is said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself by its own presence. But as regards the second kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the mere presence of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> does not suffice, and there is further required a careful and subtle inquiry. Hence many are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and many have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> about it. So <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 9), concerning such <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> inquiry: "Let the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> strive not to see itself as if it were absent, but to discern itself as present"--i.e. to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how it differs from other things; which is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The mind <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself by means of itself, because at length it acquires <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of itself, though led thereto by its own act: because it is itself that it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> since it loves itself, as he says in the same passage. For a thing can be called self-evident in two ways, either because we can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it by nothing else except itself, as first principles are called self-evident; or because it is not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> knowable, as color is visible of itself, whereas <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is visible by its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is an act in the genus of intelligible things, and therefore it is both <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the thing understood. Hence an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> apprehends his own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> through itself: not so the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, which is either altogether in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to intelligible things--as is the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>--or is the act of intelligible things abstracted from the phantasms--as is the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This saying of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is universally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in every kind of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For as sense in act is the sensible in act, by reason of the sensible likeness which is the form of sense in act, so likewise the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act is the object understood in act, by reason of the likeness of the thing understood, which is the form of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act. So the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which becomes actual by the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the object understood, is itself understood by the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as by its own form. Now to say that in "things without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and what is understood are the same," is equal to saying that "as regards things actually understood the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and what is understood are the same." For a thing is actually understood in that it is immaterial. But a distinction must be drawn: since the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> of some things are immaterial--as the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> called <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, each of which is understood and understands, whereas there are other things whose <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> are not wholly immaterial, but only the abstract likenesses thereof. Hence the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> says (De Anima iii) that the proposition quoted is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> only of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; because in a sense it is verified in their regard, and not in regard of other <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, as already stated (Reply to Objection 2).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether our intellect knows the habits of the soul by their essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 1): "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is not seen in the heart wherein it abides, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a man may be seen by another from the movement of the body; but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> most certainly that it is there, and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> proclaims its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>"; and the same principle applies to the other <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their acts, but by themselves.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, material things outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their likeness being present in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and are said therefore to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their likenesses. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are present by their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "whatever is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a thing being such is still more so." But <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> things to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore they are still more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in themselves.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Habits like powers are the principles of acts. But as is said (De Anima ii, 4), "acts and operations are <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> prior to powers." Therefore in the same way they are prior to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>; and thus <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, like the powers, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their acts.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a kind of medium between mere power and mere act. Now, it has been said (1) that nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> but as it is actual: therefore so far as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> fails in being a perfect act, it falls short in being of itself knowable, and can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only by its act; thus, for example, anyone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> he has a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> from the fact that he can produce the act proper to that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; or he may inquire into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> by considering the act. The first kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> arises from its being present, for the very fact of its presence <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the act whereby it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. The second kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> arises from a careful inquiry, as is explained above of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> (1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by external movement of the body, it is perceived by the subject wherein it resides, by the interior act of the heart. For no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he has <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unless he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Habits are present in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, not as its object since, in the present state of life, our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect's</a> object is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a material thing as stated above (Question 84, Article 7), but as that by which it understands.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The axiom, "whatever is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a thing being such, is still more so," is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of things that are of the same order, for instance, of the same kind of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; for example, we may say that health is desirable on account of life, and therefore life is more desirable still. But if we take things of different orders the axiom is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: for we may say that health is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by medicine, but it does not follow that medicine is more desirable than health, for health belongs to the order of final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, whereas medicine belongs to the order of efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. So of two things belonging <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to the order of the objects of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the one which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the other being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, is the more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, as principles are more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> than conclusions. But <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> as such does not belong to the order of objects of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; nor are things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as on account of an object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but as on account of a disposition or form whereby the subject <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>: and therefore the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether our intellect knows its own act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its own act. For what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is the object of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> faculty. But the act differs from the object. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its own act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by some act. If, then, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> its own act, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it by some act, and again it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that act by some other act; this is to proceed indefinitely, which seems impossible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has the same relation to its act as sense has to its act. But the proper sense does not feel its own act, for this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a>, as stated De Anima iii, 2. Therefore neither does the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understand its own act.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 11), "I understand that I understand."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1,2) a thing is intelligible according as it is in act. Now the ultimate perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> consists in its own operation: for this is not an act tending to something else in which lies the perfection of the work accomplished, as building is the perfection of the thing built; but it remains in the agent as its perfection and act, as is said Metaph. ix, Did. viii, 8. Therefore the first thing understood of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is its own act of understanding. This occurs in different ways with different <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>. For there is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, namely, the Divine, which is Its own act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, so that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the understanding of His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, and the understanding of His Essence, are one and the same act, because His Essence is His act of understanding. But there is another <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a>, which is not its own act of understanding, as we have said above (Question 79, Article 1), and yet the first object of that act is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Wherefore although there is a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> distinction between the act whereby he understands that he understands, and that whereby he understands his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, yet he understands both by one and the same act; because to understand his own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the proper perfection of his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and by one and the same act is a thing, together with its perfection, understood. And there is yet another, namely, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which neither is its own act of understanding, nor is its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> the first object of its act of understanding, for this object is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a material thing. And therefore that which is first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is an object of this kind, and that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> secondarily is the act by which that object is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; and through the act the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the perfection of which is this act of understanding. For this reason did the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> assert that objects are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> before acts, and acts before powers (De Anima ii, 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is something universal, namely, "being" and "the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>," in which the act also of understanding is comprised. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can understand its own act. But not primarily, since the first object of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in this state of life, is not every being and everything <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but "being" and "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>," as considered in material things, as we have said above (Question 84, Article 7), from which it acquires <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all other things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> act of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not the act and perfection of the material <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> understood, as if the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the material thing and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> act could be understood by one act; just as a thing and its perfection are understood by one act. Hence the act whereby the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands a stone is distinct from the act whereby it understands that it understands a stone; and so on. Nor is there any difficulty in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> being thus <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, as explained above (Question 86, Article 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The proper sense feels by reason of the immutation in the material organ <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the external sensible. A material object, however, cannot immute itself; but one is immuted by another, and therefore the act of the proper sense is perceived by the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, on the contrary, does not perform the act of understanding by the material immutation of an organ; and so there is no comparison.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the intellect understands the act of the will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not understand the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, unless it be in some way present in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are distinct. Therefore the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the act is specified by the object. But the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not the same as the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is specifically distinct from the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and therefore the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Confess. x, 17) says of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> affections that "they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> neither by images as bodies are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; nor by their presence, like the arts; but by certain notions." Now it does not seem that there can be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> any other notions of things but either the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> of things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> or the likenesses thereof. Therefore it seems impossible for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> such affections of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 11), "I understand that I will."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 59, Article 1), the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is nothing but an inclination consequent on the form understood; just as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is an inclination consequent on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form. Now the inclination of a thing resides in it according to its mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and hence the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination resides in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, and the inclination called the sensible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is in the sensible thing sensibly; and likewise the intelligible inclination, which is the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> subject intelligibly as in its principle and proper subject. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> expresses himself thus (De Anima iii, 9)--that "the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in the reason." Now whatever is intelligibly in an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> subject, is understood by that subject. Therefore the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is understood by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, both inasmuch as one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that one wills; and inasmuch as one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this act, and consequently, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its principle which is the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument would hold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were in different subjects, as they are distinct powers; for then whatever was in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> would not be in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But as both are rooted in the same <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and since one is in a certain way the principle of the other, consequently what is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is, in a certain way, also in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" and the "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>" which are the objects of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, differ <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>, but one is contained in the other, as we have said above (82, 4, ad 1; 16, 4, ad 1); for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Therefore the objects of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> fall under the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and those of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can fall under the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The affections of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> not by similitude only, like bodies; nor by being present in their subject, as the arts; but as the thing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> is in its principle, which contains some notion of the thing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>. And so <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> affections are in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> by certain notions.
