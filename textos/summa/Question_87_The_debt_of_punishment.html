<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the debt of punishment is an effect of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the debt of punishment is not an effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> related to a thing, does not seem to be its proper effect. Now the debt of punishment is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> related to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for it is beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the sinner. Therefore the debt of punishment is not an effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But punishment is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since it is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it is not an effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. i) that "every inordinate affection is its own punishment." But punishment does not incur a further debt of punishment, because then it would go on indefinitely. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not incur the debt of punishment.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse9">Romans 2:9</a>): "Tribulation and anguish upon every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that worketh <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." But to work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> incurs a punishment which is signified by the words "tribulation and anguish."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It has passed from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs that whenever one thing rises up against another, it suffers some detriment therefrom. For we observe in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things that when one contrary supervenes, the other acts with greater energy, for which reason "hot water freezes more rapidly," as stated in Meteor. i, 12. Wherefore we find that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to repress those who rise up against him. Now it is evident that all things contained in an order, are, in a manner, one, in relation to the principle of that order. Consequently, whatever rises up against an order, is put down by that order or by the principle thereof. And because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an inordinate act, it is evident that whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, commits an offense against an order: wherefore he is put down, in consequence, by that same order, which repression is punishment.

<p>Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be punished with a threefold punishment corresponding to the three orders to which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is subject. In the first place a man's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is subjected to the order of his own reason; secondly, it is subjected to the order of another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who governs him either in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> or in temporal matters, as a member either of the state or of the household; thirdly, it is subjected to the universal order of the Divine government. Now each of these orders is disturbed by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for the sinner acts against his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Wherefore he incurs a threefold punishment; one, inflicted by himself, viz. remorse of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; another, inflicted by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and a third, inflicted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Punishment follows <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, inasmuch as this is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by reason of its being inordinate. Wherefore just as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the sinner's act, being beside his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, so also is the debt of punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Further, a just punishment may be inflicted either by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: wherefore the punishment itself is the effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not directly but dispositively. Sin, however, makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deserving of punishment, and that is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: for <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "punishment is not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but to deserve punishment is." Consequently the debt of punishment is considered to be directly the effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This punishment of the "inordinate affection" is due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as overturning the order of reason. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> incurs a further punishment, through disturbing the order of the Divine or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether sin can be the punishment of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the purpose of punishment is to bring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> back to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. x, 9). Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not bring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> back to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but leads him in the opposite direction. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just punishments are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 82). But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of punishment is to be something against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is something from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as shown above (74, A1,2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> speaks (Hom. xi in Ezech.) that some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are punishments of others.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may speak of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in two ways: first, in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as such; secondly, as to that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> thereto. Sin as such can nowise be the punishment of another. Because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> considered in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is something proceeding from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, for it is from this that it derives the character of guilt. Whereas punishment is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> something against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated in the I, 48, 5. Consequently it is evident that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> regarded in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> can nowise be the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> in three ways. First, when one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another, by removing an impediment thereto. For <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and the like are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but are impeded by the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> which is withdrawn on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore since the withdrawal of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a punishment, and is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (Question 79, Article 3), the result is that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which ensues from this is also a punishment <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. It is in this sense that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> speaks (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse24">Romans 1:24</a>) when he says: "Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave them up to the desires of their heart," i.e. to their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; because, to wit, when men are deprived of the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, they are overcome by their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. In this way <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is always said to be the punishment of a preceding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Secondly, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, which is such as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pain, whether it be an interior act, as is clearly the case with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, or an exterior act, as is the case with one who endures considerable trouble and loss in order to achieve a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, according to <a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse7">Wisdom 5:7</a>: "We wearied ourselves in the way of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>." Thirdly, on the part of the effect, so that one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is said to be a punishment by reason of its effect. In the last two ways, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a punishment not only in respect of a preceding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also with regard to itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> punishes men by permitting them to fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Sometimes indeed it is for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of those who are punished, when, to wit, men arise from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, more <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and more cautious. But it is always for the amendment of others, who seeing some men fall from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are the more fearful of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. With regard to the other two ways, it is evident that the punishment is intended for the sinner's amendment, since the very fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> endures toil and loss in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, is of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to withdraw <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This objection considers <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> as such: and the same answer applies to the Third Objection.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether any sin incurs a debt of eternal punishment?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> incurs a debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>. For a just punishment is equal to the fault, since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is equality: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/isa027.htm#verse8">Isaiah 27:8</a>): "In measure against measure, when it shall be cast off, thou shalt judge it." Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is temporal. Therefore it does not incur a debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "punishments are a kind of medicine" (Ethic. ii, 3). But no medicine should be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, because it is directed to an end, and "what is directed to an end, is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Polit. i, 6). Therefore no punishment should be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one does a thing always unless he delights in it for its own sake. But "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath not pleasure in the destruction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'of the living']. Therefore He will not inflict <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, nothing <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. But punishment is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, for it is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the one who is punished. Therefore it cannot be of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> duration.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse46">Matthew 25:46</a>): "These shall go into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>"; and (<a href="../bible/mar003.htm#verse29">Mark 3:29</a>): "He that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, shall never have forgiveness, but shall be guilty of an everlasting <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> incurs a debt of punishment through disturbing an order. But the effect remains so long as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> remains. Wherefore so long as the disturbance of the order remains the debt of punishment must needs remain also. Now disturbance of an order is sometimes reparable, sometimes irreparable: because a defect which destroys the principle is irreparable, whereas if the principle be saved, defects can be repaired by virtue of that principle. For instance, if the principle of sight be destroyed, sight cannot be restored except by Divine power; whereas, if the principle of sight be preserved, while there arise certain <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to the use of sight, these can be remedied by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or by art. Now in every order there is a principle whereby one takes part in that order. Consequently if a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> destroys the principle of the order whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the disorder will be such as to be considered in itself, irreparable, although it is possible to repair it by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the principle of this order is the last end, to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> adheres by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore whatever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> turn <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so as to destroy <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, considered in themselves, incur a debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Punishment is proportionate to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in point of severity, both in Divine and in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgments. In no judgment, however, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 11) is it requisite for punishment to equal fault in point of duration. For the fact that <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> or <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is committed in a moment does not call for a momentary punishment: in fact they are punished sometimes by imprisonment or banishment for life--sometimes even by death; wherein account is not taken of the time occupied in killing, but rather of the expediency of removing the murderer from the fellowship of the living, so that this punishment, in its own way, represents the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of punishment inflicted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Dial. iv, 44) it is just that he who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in his own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> should be punished in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in his own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, not only as regards continual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> throughout his whole life, but also because, from the very fact that he fixes his end in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he has the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, everlastingly. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. iv, 44) that the "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> would wish to live without end, that they might abide in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> for ever."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even the punishment that is inflicted according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws, is not always intended as a medicine for the one who is punished, but sometimes only for others: thus when a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> is hanged, this is not for his own amendment, but for the sake of others, that at least they may be deterred from crime through fear of the punishment, according to <a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse25">Proverbs 19:25</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> being scourged, the fool shall be wiser." Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishments inflicted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the reprobate, are medicinal punishments for those who refrain from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through the thought of those punishments, according to <a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse6">Psalm 59:6</a>: "Thou hast given a warning to them that fear Thee, that they may flee from before the bow, that Thy beloved may be delivered."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not delight in punishments for their own sake; but He does delight in the order of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which requires them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although punishment is related indirectly to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, nevertheless it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> related to the disturbance of the order, and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Wherefore, so long as the disturbance lasts, the punishment endures.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether sin incurs a debt of punishment infinite in quantity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> incurs a debt of punishment <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/jer010.htm#verse24">Jeremiah 10:24</a>): "Correct me, O Lord, but yet with judgment: and not in Thy fury, lest Thou bring me to nothing." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or fury signifies metaphorically the vengeance of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and to be brought to nothing is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> punishment, even as to make a thing out of nothing denotes <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power. Therefore according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> vengeance, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is awarded a punishment <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of punishment corresponds to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of fault, according to <a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>: "According to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall the measure also of the stripes be." Now a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>: because the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> increases according to the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against (thus it is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to strike the sovereign than a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>), and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> greatness is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> punishment is due for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a thing may be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in two ways, in duration, and in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Now the punishment is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in duration. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If this were the case, the punishments of all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> would be equal; because one <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is not greater than another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Punishment is proportionate to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> comprises two things. First, there is the turning away from the immutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, wherefore, in this respect, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Secondly, there is the inordinate turning to mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. In this respect <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is finite, both because the mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> itself is finite, and because the movement of turning towards it is finite, since the acts of a creature cannot be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Accordingly, in so far as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in turning away from something, its corresponding punishment is the "pain of loss," which also is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, because it is the loss of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But in so far as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> turns inordinately to something, its corresponding punishment is the "pain of sense," which is also finite.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It would be inconsistent with Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> for the sinner to be brought to nothing absolutely, because this would be incompatible with the perpetuity of punishment that Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> requires, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). The expression "to be brought to nothing" is applied to one who is deprived of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>: "If I . . . have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, I am nothing."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as turning away from something, for it is thus that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Duration of punishment corresponds to duration of fault, not indeed as regards the act, but on the part of the stain, for as long as this remains, the debt of punishment remains. But punishment corresponds to fault in the point of severity. And a fault which is irreparable, is such that, of itself, it lasts for ever; wherefore it incurs an <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>. But it is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> as regards the thing it turns to; wherefore, in this respect, it does not incur punishment of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether every sin incurs a debt of eternal punishment?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> incurs a debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>. Because punishment, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), is proportionate to the fault. Now <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> differs <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> from temporal punishment: whereas no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, apparently, differs <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> from another, since every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>, which cannot be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Since therefore some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> incur a debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), it seems that no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> incurs a debt of mere temporal punishment.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is the least of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xciii) that "the lightest punishment is incurred by those who are punished for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> alone." But <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> incurs <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>, since children who have died in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> through not being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, will never see the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, as shown by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> words (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse3">John 3:3</a>): " Unless a man be born again, he cannot see the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Much more, therefore, will the punishments of all other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">everlasting</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not deserve greater punishment through being united to another <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has allotted its punishment to each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deserves <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> if it be united to a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in a lost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> there is no remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by itself deserves <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>. Therefore temporal punishment is not due for any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. iv, 39), that certain slighter <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted after this life. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> incurs a debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, in so far as it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an irreparable disorder in the order of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, through being contrary to the very principle of that order, viz. the last end. Now it is evident that in some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> there is disorder indeed, but such as not to involve contrariety in respect of the last end, but only in respect of things referable to the end, in so far as one is too much or too little intent on them without prejudicing the order to the last end: as, for instance, when a man is too fond of some temporal thing, yet would not offend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its sake, by breaking one of His commandments. Consequently such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not incur everlasting, but only temporal punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sins</a> do not differ <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> from one another in respect of their turning towards mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which constitutes the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act; but they do differ <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> in respect of their turning away from something. Because some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> consist in turning away from the last end, and some in a disorder affecting things referable to the end: and the last end differs <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> from the things that are referred to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> incurs <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>, not on account of its gravity, but by reason of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the subject, viz. a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human being</a> deprived of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, without which there is no remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>The same answer applies to the Third Objection about venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of punishment does not correspond to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but to its irremissibility, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the debt of punishment remains after sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there remains no debt of punishment after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be removed the effect is removed. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the debt of punishment. Therefore, when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is removed, the debt of punishment ceases also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is removed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> returning to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deserves, not punishment, but reward. Therefore, when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is removed, the debt of punishment no longer remains.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "Punishments are a kind of medicine" (Ethic. ii, 3). But a man is not given medicine after being cured of his disease. Therefore, when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is removed the debt of punishment does not remain.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/2sa012.htm#verse13">2 Samuel 12:13-14</a>): "David said to Nathan: I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the Lord. And Nathan said to David: The Lord also hath taken away thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; thou shalt not die. Nevertheless because thou hast given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> . . . the child that is born to thee shall die." Therefore a man is punished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> even after his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven: and so the debt of punishment remains, when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been removed.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things may be considered in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: the guilty act, and the consequent stain. Now it is evident that in all actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has ceased, the guilt remains; because the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deserving of punishment, in so far as he transgresses the order of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, to which he cannot return except he pay some sort of penal compensation, which restores him to the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; so that, according to the order of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, he who has been too indulgent to his will, by transgressing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandments, suffers, either willingly or unwillingly, something contrary to what he would wish. This restoration of the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by penal compensation is also to be observed in injuries done to one's fellow men. Consequently it is evident that when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> or injurious act has ceased there still remains the debt of punishment.

<p>But if we speak of the removal of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as to the stain, it is evident that the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be removed from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, without the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it was through being separated from Him that it suffered the loss of its brightness, in which the stain consists, as stated above (Question 86, Article 1). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by his will. Wherefore the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be removed from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unless his will accept the order of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that is to say, unless either of his own accord he take upon himself the punishment of his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or bear patiently the punishment which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> inflicts on him; and in both ways punishment avails for satisfaction. Now when punishment is satisfactory, it loses somewhat of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of punishment: for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of punishment is to be against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; and although satisfactory punishment, absolutely speaking, is against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, nevertheless in this particular case and for this particular purpose, it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Consequently it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> simply, but involuntary in a certain respect, as we have explained when speaking of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and the involuntary (6, 6). We must, therefore, say that, when the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been removed, there may remain a debt of punishment, not indeed of punishment simply, but of satisfactory punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as after the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has ceased, the stain remains, as stated above (Question 86, Article 2), so the debt of punishment also can remain. But when the stain has been removed, the debt of punishment does not remain in the same way, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not deserve punishment simply, but he may deserve it as satisfactory: because his very <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> demands that he should do satisfaction for his offenses against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When the stain is removed, the wound of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is healed as regards the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But punishment is still requisite in order that the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be healed, since they were so disordered by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed, so that, to wit, the disorder may be remedied by the contrary of that which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> it. Moreover punishment is requisite in order to restore the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and to remove the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> given to others, so that those who were scandalized at the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> many be edified by the punishment, as may be seen in the example of David quoted above.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether every punishment is inflicted for a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not every punishment is inflicted for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse3">John 9:3,2</a>) about the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> born blind: "Neither hath this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, nor his parents . . . that he should be born blind." In like manner we see that many children, those also who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, suffer grievous punishments, fevers, for instance, diabolical possession, and so forth, and yet there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in them after they have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Moreover before they are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, there is no more <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in them than in the other children who do not suffer such things. Therefore not every punishment is inflicted for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that sinners should thrive and that the innocent should be punished seem to come under the same head. Now each of these is frequently observed in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, for it is written about the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> (<a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse5">Psalm 72:5</a>): "They are not in the labor of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: neither shall they be scourged like other men"; and (<a href="../bible/job021.htm#verse7">Job 21:7</a>): "[Why then do] the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> live, are [they] advanced, and strengthened with <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>" (?)[The words in brackets show the readings of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>]; and (<a href="../bible/hab001.htm#verse13">Habakkuk 1:13</a>): "Why lookest Thou upon the contemptuous [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'them that do <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> things'], and holdest Thy peace, when the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> oppresseth [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'devoureth'], the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is more just than himself?" Therefore not every punishment is inflicted for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse22">1 Peter 2:22</a>) that "He did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor was guile found in His mouth." And yet it is said (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse21">1 Peter 2:21</a>) that "He suffered for us." Therefore punishment is not always inflicted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job004.htm#verse7">Job 4:7, seqq.</a>): "Who ever perished innocent? Or when were the just destroyed?

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> I have seen those who work iniquity . . . perishing by the blast of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> writes (Retract. i) that "all punishment is just, and is inflicted for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As already stated (6), punishment can be considered in two ways--simply, and as being satisfactory. A satisfactory punishment is, in a way, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. And since those who differ as to the debt of punishment, may be one in will by the union of love, it happens that one who has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, bears willingly the punishment for another: thus even in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs we see men take the debts of another upon themselves. If, however, we speak of punishment simply, in respect of its being something penal, it has always a relation to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the one punished. Sometimes this is a relation to actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as when a man is punished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed by him. Sometimes it is a relation to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>: and this, either principally or consequently--principally, the punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is left to itself, and deprived of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and consequently, all the penalties which result from this defect in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Nevertheless we must observe that sometimes a thing seems penal, and yet is not so simply. Because punishment is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated in the I, 48, 5. Now <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is manifold, viz. <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the body, and external goods, it happens sometimes that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suffers the loss of a lesser <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that he may profit in a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as when he suffers loss of money for the sake of bodily health, or loss of both of these, for the sake of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> health and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In such cases the loss is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not simply but relatively; wherefore it does not answer to the name of punishment simply, but of medicinal punishment, because a medical <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> prescribes bitter potions to his patients, that he may restore them to health. And since such like are not punishments properly speaking, they are not referred to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, except in a restricted sense: because the very fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> needs a treatment of penal medicines, is due to the corruption of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which is itself the punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. For there was no need, in the state of innocence, for penal exercises in order to make progress in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; so that whatever is penal in the exercise of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is reduced to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Such like defects of those who are born with them, or which children suffer from, are the effects and the punishments of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as stated above (Question 85, Article 5); and they remain even after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> stated above (85, 5, ad 2): and that they are not equally in all, is due to the diversity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is left to itself, as stated above (85, 5, ad 1). Nevertheless, they are directed by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, either of those who suffer, or of others who are admonished by their means--and also to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Temporal and bodily goods are indeed goods of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but they are of small account: whereas <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> chief goods. Consequently it belongs to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to give <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, and to award them as much temporal goods or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, as suffices for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. viii), "Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does not enfeeble the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by material <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>." The very fact that others receive temporal goods, is detrimental to their <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; wherefore the psalm quoted concludes (<a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse6">verse 6</a>): "Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> hath held them fast."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> bore a satisfactory punishment, not for His, but for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether anyone is punished for another's sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one may be punished for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse5">Exodus 20:5</a>): "I am . . . <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . jealous, visiting the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Me"; and (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse35">Matthew 23:35</a>): "That upon you may come all the just blood that hath been shed upon the earth."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> springs from Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now, according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, children are sometimes punished for their parents, as in the case of high treason. Therefore also according to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, one is punished for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if it be replied that the son is punished, not for the father's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but for his own, inasmuch as he imitates his father's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; this would not be said of the children rather than of outsiders, who are punished in like manner as those whose crimes they imitate. It seems, therefore, that children are punished, not for their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but for those of their parents.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse20">Ezekiel 18:20</a>): "The son shall not bear the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the father."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we speak of that satisfactory punishment, which one takes upon oneself <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, one may bear another's punishment, in so far as they are, in some way, one, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). If, however, we speak of punishment inflicted on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, inasmuch as it is penal, then each one is punished for his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> only, because the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act is something personal. But if we speak of a punishment that is medicinal, in this way it does happen that one is punished for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it has been stated (7) that ills sustained in bodily goods or even in the body itself, are medicinal punishments intended for the health of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Wherefore there is no reason why one should not have such like punishments inflicted on one for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; e.g. on children for their parents, or on servants for their masters, inasmuch as they are their property so to speak; in such a way, however, that, if the children or the servants take part in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this penal ill has the character of punishment in regard to both the one punished and the one he is punished for. But if they do not take part in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it has the character of punishment in regard to the one for whom the punishment is borne, while, in regard to the one who is punished, it is merely medicinal (except <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, if he consent to the other's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>), since it is intended for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, if he bears it patiently.

<p>With regard to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> punishments, these are not merely medicinal, because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not directed to a yet higher <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently no one suffers loss in the goods of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without some fault of his own. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Avit.) [Ep. ad Auxilium, ccl.], such like punishments are not inflicted on one for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because, as regards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the son is not the father's property. Hence the Lord assigns the reason for this by saying (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse4">Ezekiel 18:4</a>): "All <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are Mine."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Both the passages quoted should, seemingly, be referred to temporal or bodily punishments, in so far as children are the property of their parents, and posterity, of their forefathers. Else, if they be referred to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> punishments, they must be understood in reference to the imitation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wherefore in Exodus these words are added, "Of them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Me," and in the chapter quoted from Matthew (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse32">verse 32</a>) we read: "Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers." The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the fathers are said to be punished in their children, because the latter are the more prone to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through being brought up amid their parents' crimes, both by becoming accustomed to them, and by imitating their parents' example, conforming to their authority as it were. Moreover they deserve heavier punishment if, seeing the punishment of their parents, they fail to mend their ways. The text adds, "to the third and fourth generation," because men are wont to live long enough to see the third and fourth generation, so that both the children can witness their parents' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> so as to imitate them, and the parents can see their children's punishments so as to grieve for them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The punishments which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> inflicts on one for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are bodily and temporal. They are also remedies or medicines against future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in order that either they who are punished, or others may be restrained from similar faults.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who are near of kin are said to be punished, rather than outsiders, for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others, both because the punishment of kindred redounds somewhat upon those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, as stated above, in so far as the child is the father's property, and because the examples and the punishments that occur in one's own household are more moving. Consequently when a man is brought up amid the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his parents, he is more eager to imitate them, and if he is not deterred by their punishments, he would seem to be the more obstinate, and, therefore, to deserve more severe punishment.
