<h1>Question 87. The knowledge which, after rising again, men will have at the judgment concerning merits and demerits</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5087.htm#article1"> At the judgment, will every man know all his sins?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5087.htm#article2"> Will every one be able to read all that is on another's conscience?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5087.htm#article3"> Will one be able at one glance to see all merits and demerits?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether after the resurrection every one will know what sins he has committed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> everyone will not be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> he has committed. For whatever we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, either we receive it anew through the senses, or we draw it from the treasure house of the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. Now after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> men will be unable to perceive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by means of sense, because they will be things of the past, while sense perceives only the present: and many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> will have escaped the sinner's <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, and he will be unable to recall them from the treasure house of his <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. Therefore after rising again one will not be cognizant of all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> one has committed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 43), that "there are certain books of the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, wherein each one's <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> are inscribed." Now one cannot read a thing in a book, unless it be marked down in the book: and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> leaves its mark upon the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> on <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse15">Romans 2:15</a>, "Their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> bearing witness," etc. which mark, seemingly, is nothing else than the guilt or stain. Since then in many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the guilt or stain of many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is blotted out by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it would seem that one cannot read in one's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> one has committed: and thus the same conclusion follows as before.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greater the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the greater the effect. Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which makes us grieve for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which we recall to <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Since then <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is perfect in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, they will grieve exceedingly for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if they recall them to <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>: yet this is impossible, seeing that according to <a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse4">Apocalypse 21:4</a>, "Sorrow and mourning shall flee away from them." [The quotation is from <a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse10">Isaiah 35:10</a>. The text of the Apocalypse has: "Nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more."] Therefore they will not recall their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the damned will be to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> they once did as the blessed to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they once committed. Now seemingly the damned after rising again will have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> they once did, since this would alleviate their pain considerably. Neither therefore will the blessed have any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they had committed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xx) that "a kind of Divine energy will come to our aid, so that we shall recall all of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>."

<p>Further, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment is to external evidence, so is the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a> to the witness of the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1sa016.htm#verse7">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, "Man seeth those things that appear, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> beholdeth the heart." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot pass a perfect judgment on a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> unless evidence be taken on all the points that need to be judged. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a> is most perfect, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to witness to everything that has to be judged. But all works, both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, will have to be judged (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>): "We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Therefore each one's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> must needs retain all the works he has done, whether <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse15">Romans 2:15-16</a>, "In the day when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall judge" each one's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> will bear witness to him and his thoughts will accuse and defend him. And since in every judicial hearing, the witness, the accuser, and the defendant need to be acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> on which judgment has to be pronounced, and since at the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">general judgment</a> all the works of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> will be submitted to judgment, it will behoove every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be cognizant then of all his works. Wherefore each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> will be as a book containing his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> on which judgment will be pronounced, even as in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> court of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> we make use of records. Of these books it is written in the Apocalypse (20:12): "The books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged by those things which were written in the books [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'book'], according to their works." According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> exposition (De Civ. Dei xx) the books which are here said to be opened "denote the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New</a> and <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testaments</a> in whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandments are exemplified." Hence <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a> (De judic. potest.) says: "Their hearts will be like the code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." But the book of life, of which the text goes on to speak, signifies each one's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, which is said to be one single book, because the one Divine power will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> all to recall their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and this energy, in so far as it reminds a man of his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, is called the "book of life" [Cf. I, 24, 1, ad 1]. Or else we may refer the first books to the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and by the second book we may understand the Judge's sentence as expressed in His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although many <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and demerits will have escaped our <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, yet there will be none of them but will remain somewhat in its effect, because those <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> which are not deadened will remain in the reward accorded to them, while those that are deadened remain in the guilt of ingratitude, which is increased through the fact that a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> after receiving <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. In like manner those demerits which are not blotted out by repentance remain in the debt of punishment due to them, while those which have been blotted out by repentance remain in the remembrance of repentance, which they will recall together with their other <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Hence in each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there will be something whereby he will be able to recollect his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Nevertheless, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xx), the Divine energy will especially conduce to this.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Each one's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> will bear certain marks of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done by him; and it does not follow that these marks are the guilt alone, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> will be so full of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that they will have no room for sorrow; and so they will not grieve for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but rather will they rejoice in the Divine mercy, whereby their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven them. Even so do the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> rejoice now in the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> whereby those whom they guard fall headlong into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through being abandoned by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. and whose <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> none the less they eagerly watch over.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> they have done, and this will not diminish their pain; indeed, it will increase it, because the greatest sorrow is to have lost many goods: for which reason <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. ii) that "the greatest misfortune is to have been <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether every one will be able to read all that is in another's conscience?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it will be impossible for every one to read all that is in another's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those who rise again will not be clearer than that of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, equality with whom is promised us after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot read one another's thoughts in matters dependent on the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, wherefore they need to speak in order to notify such things to one another [Cf. I, 107]. Therefore after rising again we shall be unable to read what is contained in another's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> either in itself, or in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or in its effect. Now the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or demerits contained in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by another in themselves, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone enters the heart and reads its secrets. Neither will it be possible for them to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, since all will not see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who alone can act on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whence <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and demerits proceed. Nor again will it be possible to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them from their effect, since there will be many demerits, which through being wholly blotted out by repentance will leave no effect remaining. Therefore it will not be possible for every one to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all that is in another's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xxxi in Ep. ad Hebr.), as we have quoted before (Sent. iv, D, 17): "If thou remember thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> now, and frequently confess them before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and beg pardon for them, thou wilt very soon blot them out; but if thou forget them, thou wilt then remember them unwillingly, when they will be made public, and declared before all thy friends and foes, and in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." Hence it follows that this publication will be the punishment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> neglect in omitting to confess his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which a man has confessed will not be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to others.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is a relief to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that one has had many associates in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that one is less ashamed thereof. If therefore every one were to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of another, each sinner's shame would be much diminished, which is unlikely. Therefore every one will not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>, "will . . . bring to light the hidden things of darkness," says: "<a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">Deeds</a> and thoughts both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will then be revealed and made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all."

<p>Further, the past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will be equally blotted out. Yet we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of some <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, for instance of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalen</a>, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, and David. Therefore in like manner the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the other elect will be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and much more those of the damned.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> At the last and <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">general judgment</a> it behooves the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which now is in many ways hidden, to appear evidently to all. Now the sentence of one who condemns or rewards cannot be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, unless it be delivered according to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and demerits. Therefore just as it behooves both judge and jury to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of a case, in order to deliver a just verdict, so is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in order that the sentence appear to be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, that all who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the sentence should be acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Hence, since every one will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of his reward or condemnation, so will every one else <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of it, and consequently as each one will recall his own <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or demerits, so will he be cognizant of those of others. This is the more probable and more common opinion, although the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iv, D, 43) says the contrary, namely that a man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> blotted out by repentance will not be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to others at the judgment. But it would follow from this that neither would his repentance for these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, which would detract considerably from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and the praise due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for having so mercifully delivered them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All the preceding <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or demerits will come to a certain amount in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> or unhappiness of each one rising again. Consequently through <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things being seen, all things in their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> will be visible, especially as the Divine power will conduce to this so that the Judge's sentence may appear just to all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It will be possible for a man's <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or demerits to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their effects as stated above (1, ad 1), or by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although the power of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not sufficient for this.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The manifestation of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to the confusion of the sinner is a result of his neglect in omitting to confess them. But that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> be revealed cannot be to their confusion or shame, as neither does it bring confusion to <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> that her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are publicly recalled in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, because shame is "fear of disgrace," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii), and this will be impossible in the blessed. But this manifestation will bring them great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on account of the penance they did, even as the confessor hails a man who <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> confesses great crimes. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sins</a> are said to be blotted out because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees them not for the purpose of punishing them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The sinner's confusion will not be diminished, but on the contrary increased, through his seeing the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others, for in seeing that others are blameworthy he will all the more acknowledge himself to be blamed. For that confusion be diminished by a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this kind is owing to the fact that shame regards the esteem of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who esteem more lightly that which is customary. But then confusion will regard the esteem of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which weighs every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whether it be the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or of many.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether all merits and demerits, one's own as well as those of others, will be seen by anyone at a single glance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not all <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and demerits, one's own as well as those of others, will be seen by anyone at a single glance. For things considered singly are not seen at one glance. Now the damned will consider their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> singly and will bewail them, wherefore they say (<a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse8">Wisdom 5:8</a>): "What hath <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> profited us?" Therefore they will not see them all at a glance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Topic. ii) that "we do not arrive at understanding several things at the same time." Now <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and demerits, both our own and those of others, will not be visible save to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore it will be impossible for them all to be seen at the same time.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the damned after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will not be clearer than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the blessed and of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is now, as to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things by innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now by such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not see several things at the same time. Therefore neither will the damned be able then to see all their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> at the same time.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/job008.htm#verse22">Job 8:22</a>, "They . . . shall be clothed with confusion," says: "As soon as they shall see the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Judge</a>, all their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> will stand before their eyes." Now they will see the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Judge</a> suddenly. Therefore in like manner will they see the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> they have done, and for the same reason all others.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xx) considers it unfitting that at the judgment a material book should be read containing the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> written therein, for the reason that it would be impossible to measure the size of such a book, or the time it would take to read. But in like manner it would be impossible to estimate the length of time one would require in order to consider all one's <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and demerits and those of others, if one saw these various things one after the other. Therefore we must admit that each one sees them all at the same time.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two opinions on this question. For some say that one will see all <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and demerits, both one's own and those of others, at the same time in an instant. This is easily credible with regard to the blessed, since they will see all things in the Word: and consequently it is not unreasonable that they should see several things at the same time. But with regard to the damned, a difficulty presents itself, since their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not raised so that they can see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and all else in Him. Wherefore others say that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will see all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and those of others generically at the same time: and this suffices for the accusation or <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the judgment; but that they will not see them all down to each single one at the same time. But neither does this seem consonant with the words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xx), who says that they will count them all with one glance of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; and what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> generically is not counted. Hence we may choose a middle way, by holding that they will consider each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not instantaneously, but in a very short time, the Divine power coming to their aid. This agrees with the saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xx) that "they will be discerned with wondrous rapidity." Nor is this impossible, since in a space of time, however short, is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of instants.

<p>This suffices for the replies to the objections on either side of the question.
