<h1>Question 87. The remission of venial sin</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4087.htm#article1"> Can venial sin be forgiven without Penance?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4087.htm#article2"> Can it be forgiven without the infusion of grace?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4087.htm#article3"> Are venial sins forgiven by the sprinkling of holy water, a bishop's blessing, the beating of the breast, the Lord's Prayer, and the like?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4087.htm#article4"> Can a venial sin be taken away without a mortal sin?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether venial sin can be forgiven without Penance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be forgiven without penance. For, as stated above (84, 10, ad 4), it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> penance that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not only sorrow for his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but also that he should purpose to avoid them for the future. Now venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven without any such purpose, for it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot lead the present life without committing venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be forgiven without penance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is no penance without actual displeasure at one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be taken away without any actual displeasure at them, as would be the case if a man were to be killed in his sleep, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, since he would go to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> at once, which would not happen if his venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> remained. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be forgiven without penance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are contrary to the fervor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated in the II-II, 24, 10. Now one contrary is removed by another. Therefore forgiveness of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the fervor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which may be without actual displeasure at venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in De Poenitentia [De vera et falsa Poenitentia, the authorship of which is unknown, that "there is a penance which is done for venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> every day" which would be useless if venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> could be forgiven without Penance.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 86, Article 2), is effected by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> being united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from Whom <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> separates him in some way. Now this separation is made complete by mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and incomplete by venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because, by mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> through acting against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is altogether turned away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whereas by venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affections are clogged, so that they are slow in tending towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently both kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are taken away by penance, because by both of them <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is disordered through turning inordinately to a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for just as mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be forgiven so long as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is attached to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so neither can venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because while the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> remains, the effect remains.

<p>Yet a more perfect penance is requisite for the forgiveness of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, namely that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should detest actually the mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he committed, so far as lies in his power, that is to say, he should endeavor to remember each single mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in order to detest each one. But this is, not required for the forgiveness of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; although it does not suffice to have <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> displeasure, which is included in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> or of penance as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since then venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would be incompatible with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. Consequently it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a certain virtual displeasure, so that, for instance, a man's affections so tend to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Divine things, that whatever might happen to him to hamper that tendency would be displeasing to him, and would grieve him, were he to commit it, even though he were not to think of it actually: and this is not sufficient for the remission of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except as regards those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he fails to remember after a careful examination.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, he can avoid all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and each single one; and he can avoid each single venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but not all, as was explained in I-II, 74, 8, ad 2; I-II, 109, 8. Consequently penance for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> requires <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to purpose abstaining from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, all and each; whereas penance for venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> requires <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to purpose abstaining from each, but not from all, because the weakness of this life does not allow of this. Nevertheless he needs to have the purpose of taking steps to commit fewer venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, else he would be in danger of falling back, if he gave up the desire of going forward, or of removing the obstacles to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> progress, such as venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Death for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, as stated above (Question 66, Article 11), obtains the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, wherefore it washes away all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, both venial and mortal, unless it find the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> attached to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fervor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> implies virtual displeasure at venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as stated above (Question 79, Article 4).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether infusion of grace is necessary for the remission of venial sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Because an effect is not produced without its proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not forgiven through his own <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse4">Ephesians 2:4-5</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is rich in mercy, for His exceeding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, hath quickened us together in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by Whose <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you are saved." Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not forgiven without infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not forgiven without Penance. Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is infused, in Penance as in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not forgiven without infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> produces a stain on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now a stain is not removed save by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> beauty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore it seems that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not forgiven without infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The advent of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> neither destroys nor diminishes <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as stated in the II-II, 24, 10. Therefore, in like manner, an infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order to remove venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Each thing is removed by its contrary. But venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but hampers its act, through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> being too much attached to a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, albeit not in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated in I-II, 88, 1; II-II, 24, 10. Therefore, in order that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be removed, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be infused, but a movement of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> suffices for its forgiveness.

<p>Nevertheless, since in those who have the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> (in whom alone can there be venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>), there can be no infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> without an actual movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, consequently whenever <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is infused anew, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even the forgiveness of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is an effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in virtue of the act which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> produces anew, but not through any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> infused anew into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is never forgiven without some act, explicit or implicit, of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>): it can, however, be forgiven without the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, which is formally perfected by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, as stated above (Question 87, Article 2). Hence it does not follow that infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is required for the forgiveness of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for although this infusion takes place in every sacrament, it does not occur in every act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as there are two kinds of bodily stain, one consisting in the privation of something required for beauty, e.g. the right color or the due proportion of members, and another by the introduction of some hindrance to beauty, e.g. mud or dust; so too, a stain is put on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in one way, by the privation of the beauty of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in another, by the inordinate inclination of the affections to some temporal thing, and this is the result of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently, an infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the removal of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but in order to remove venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a movement proceeding from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, removing the inordinate attachment to the temporal thing.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether venial sins are removed by the sprinkling of holy water and the like?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not removed by the sprinkling of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> water, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, and the like. For venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not forgiven without Penance, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But Penance suffices by itself for the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore the above have nothing to do with the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, each of the above bears the same relation to one venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as to all. If therefore, by means of one of them, some venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is remitted, it follows that in like manner all are remitted, so that by beating his breast once, or by being sprinkled once with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> water, a man would be delivered from all his venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which seems unreasonable.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> occasion a debt of some punishment, albeit temporal; for it is written (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 3:12-15</a>) of him that builds up "wood, hay, stubble" that "he shall be saved, yet so as by fire." Now the above things whereby venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are said to be taken away, contain either no punishment at all, or very little. Therefore they do not suffice for the full remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in De Poenitentia [Hom. 30 inter 1; Ep. cclxv] that "for our slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> we strike our breasts, and say: Forgive us our trespasses," and so it seems that striking one's breast, and the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and the same seems to apply to the other things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), no infusion of fresh <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is required for the forgiveness of a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but it is enough to have an act proceeding from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in detestation of that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either explicit or at least implicit, as when one is moved <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">fervently</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence, for three reasons, certain things <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: first, because they imply the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> removes venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>); and so, by the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>, and by all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> without exception, wherein <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conferred, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted. Secondly, because they imply a movement of detestation for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and in this way the general confession [i.e. the recital of the Confiteor or of an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, the beating of one's breast, and the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> conduce to the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for we ask in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>: "Forgive us our trespasses." Thirdly, because they include a movement of reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Divine things; and in this way a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, the sprinkling of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> water, any sacramental anointing, a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> said in a dedicated church, and anything else of the kind, conduce to the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All these things <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in so far as they incline the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the movement of penance, viz., the implicit or explicit detestation of one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All these things, so far as they are concerned, conduce to the remission of all venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: but the remission may be hindered as regards certain venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, to which the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is still actually attached, even as insincerity sometimes impedes the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By the above things, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are indeed taken away as regards the guilt, both because those things are a kind of satisfaction, and through the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whose movement is aroused by such things.

<p>Yet it does not always happen that, by means of each one, the whole guilt of punishment is taken away, because, in that case, whoever was entirely free from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, would go straight to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> if sprinkled with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> water: but the debt of punishment is remitted by means of the above, according to the movement of fervor towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which fervor is aroused by such things, sometimes more, sometimes less.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether venial sin can be taken away without mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be taken away without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For, on <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse7">John 8:7</a>: "He that is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> among you, let him first cast a stone at her," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that "all those men were in a state of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for venial offenses were forgiven them through the legal ceremonies." Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be taken away without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is required for the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. but it is required for the forgiveness of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be taken away without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> differs from a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more than from another venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But one venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be pardoned without another, as stated above (3, ad 2; 87, 3). Therefore a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be taken away without a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse26">Matthew 5:26</a>): "Amen I say to thee, thou shalt not go out from thence," viz., from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, into which a man is cast for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, "till thou repay the last farthing," by which venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is denoted. Therefore a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not forgiven without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 87, Article 3), there is no remission of any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever except by the power of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, because, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse8">Romans 4:8</a>), it is owing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that He does not impute <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to a man, which a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on that passage expounds as referring to venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now he that is in a state of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is without the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore no venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Venial offenses, in the passage quoted, denote the irregularities or uncleannesses which men contracted in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although no new infusion of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is requisite for the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to exercise some act of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which cannot be in one who is a subject of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not preclude every act of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby all venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be removed; whereas mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> excludes altogether the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, without which no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either mortal or venial, is remitted. Hence the comparison fails.
