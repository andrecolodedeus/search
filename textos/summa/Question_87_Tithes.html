<h1>Question 87. Tithes</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3087.htm#article1"> Are men bound by precept to pay tithes?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3087.htm#article2"> Of what things ought tithes to be paid?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3087.htm#article3"> To whom ought they to be paid?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3087.htm#article4"> Who ought to pay tithes?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether men are bound to pay tithes under a necessity of precept?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that men are not bound by precept to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. The commandment to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> is contained in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> (<a href="../bible/lev027.htm#verse30">Leviticus 27:30</a>), "All <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of the land, whether of corn or of the fruits of trees, are the Lord's," and further on (<a href="../bible/lev027.htm#verse32">Leviticus 27:32</a>): "Of all the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of oxen and sheep and goats, that pass under the shepherd's rod, every tenth that cometh shall be sanctified to the Lord." This cannot be reckoned among the moral precepts, because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> does not dictate that one ought to give a tenth part, rather than a ninth or eleventh. Therefore it is either a judicial or a ceremonial precept. Now, as stated above (I-II, 103, 3; I-II, 104, 3), during the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> men are bound neither to the ceremonial nor to the judicial precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Therefore men are not bound now to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, during the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> men are bound only to those things which were commanded by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew 28:20</a>, "Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you"; and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse27">Acts 20:27</a>): "I have not spared to declare unto you all the counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now neither in the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> nor in that of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> is there any mention of the paying of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>: for the saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> about <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse23">Matthew 23:23</a>), "These things you ought to have done" seems to refer to the past time of legal observance: thus <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (Super Matth. can. xxiv): "The tithing of herbs, which was useful in foreshadowing the future, was not to be omitted." Therefore during the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> men are not bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, during the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, men are not more bound to the legal observances than before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. But before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> were given, by reason not of a precept but of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. For we read (<a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse20">Genesis 28:20-22</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> "made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>" saying: "If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall be with me, and shall keep me in the way by which I walk . . . of all the things that Thou shalt give to me, I will offer <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to Thee." Neither, therefore, during the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are men bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> men were bound to pay three kinds of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/num018.htm#verse23">Numbers 18:23-24</a>): "The sons of Levi . . . shall . . . be content with the oblation of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, which I have separated for their uses and necessities." Again, there were other <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of which we read (<a href="../bible/deu014.htm#verse22">Deuteronomy 14:22-23</a>): "Every year thou shalt set aside the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of all thy fruits, that the earth bringeth forth year by year; and thou shalt eat before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> in the place which He shall choose." And there were yet other <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/deu014.htm#verse28">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>): "The third year thou shalt separate another <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of all things that grow to thee at that time, and shalt lay it up within thy gates. And the Levite that hath no other part nor possession with thee, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, that are within thy gates, shall . . . eat and be filled." Now during the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> men are not bound to pay the second and third <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. Neither therefore are they bound to pay the first.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a debt that is due without any time being fixed for its payment, must be paid at once under pain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Accordingly if during the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> men are bound, under <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of precept, to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in those countries where <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> are not paid, they would all be in a state of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and so would also be the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for dissembling. But this seems unreasonable. Therefore during the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> men are not bound under <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of precept to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Append. Serm. cclxxcii], whose words are quoted 16, qu. i [Can. Decimae], says: "It is a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and whoever refuses to pay them takes what belongs to another."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> were paid for the sustenance of the ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse10">Malachi 3:10</a>): "Bring all the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> into My [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the'] store-house that there may be meat in My house." Hence the precept about the paying of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> was partly moral and instilled in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; and partly judicial, deriving its force from its divine institution. Because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> dictates that the people should administer the necessaries of life to those who minister the divine worship for the welfare of the whole people even as it is the people's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to provide a livelihood for their rulers and soldiers and so forth. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> proves this from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> custom, saying (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>): "Who serveth as a soldier at any time at his own charge? Who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof?" But the fixing of the proportion to be offered to the ministers of divine worship does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, but was determined by divine institution, in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of that people to whom the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was being given. For they were divided into twelve tribes, and the twelfth tribe, namely that of Levi, was engaged exclusively in the divine ministry and had no possessions whence to derive a livelihood: and so it was becomingly ordained that the remaining eleven tribes should give one-tenth part of their revenues to the Levites [<a href="../bible/num018.htm#verse21">Numbers 18:21</a> that the latter might live respectably; and also because some, through negligence, would disregard this precept. Hence, so far as the tenth part was fixed, the precept was judicial, since all institutions established among this people for the special purpose of preserving equality among men, in accordance with this people's <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, are called "judicial precepts." Nevertheless by way of consequence these institutions foreshadowed something in the future, even as everything else connected with them, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, "All these things happened to them in figure." On this respect they had something in common with the "ceremonial precepts," which were instituted chiefly that they might be signs of the future. Hence the precept about paying <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> foreshadowed something in the future. For ten is, in a way, the perfect number (being the first numerical limit, since the figures do not go beyond ten but begin over again from one), and therefore he that gave a tenth, which is the sign of perfection, reserving the nine other parts for himself, acknowledged by a sign that imperfection was his part, and that the perfection which was to come through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to be hoped for from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet this proves it to be, not a ceremonial but a judicial precept, as stated above.

<p>There is this difference between the ceremonial and judicial precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, as we stated above (I-II, 104, 3), that it is unlawful to observe the ceremonial precepts at the time of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, whereas there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in keeping the judicial precepts during the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> although they are not binding. Indeed they are bound to be observed by some, if they be ordained by the authority of those who have power to make laws. Thus it was a judicial precept of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> that he who stole a sheep should restore four sheep (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse1">Exodus 22:1</a>), and if any king were to order this to be done his subjects would be bound to obey. On like manner during the time of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has established the payment of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a>; thus showing a certain kindliness, lest the people of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> should give less to the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> than did the people of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> to the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; for the people of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are under greater <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew 5:20</a>, "Unless your <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> abound more than that of the Scribes and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, you shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>," and, moreover, the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> are of greater dignity than the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> shows (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 3:7-8</a>).

<p>Accordingly it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> arises partly from <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, partly from the institution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; who, nevertheless, in consideration of the requirements of time and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> might ordain the payment of some other proportion.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The precept about paying <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, in so far as it was a moral precept, was given in the Gospel by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> when He said (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse10">Matthew 10:10</a>) [The words as quoted are from <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse7">Luke 10:7</a>: Matthew has 'meat' instead of 'hire']: "The workman is worthy of his hire," and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says the same (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 9:4 seqq.</a>). But the fixing of the particular proportion is left to the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Before the time of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> the ministry of the divine worship was not entrusted to any particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; although it is stated that the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and that they received a double portion. For this very reason no particular portion was directed to be given to the ministers of the divine worship: but when they met with one, each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of his own accord gave him what he deemed right. Thus <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> by a kind of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> instinct gave <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Most High <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gen014.htm#verse20">Genesis 14:20</a>, and again <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to give <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> [<a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse20">Genesis 28:20</a>, although he appears to have vowed to do so, not by paying them to ministers, but for the purpose of the divine worship, for instance for the fulfilling of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, hence he said significantly: "I will offer <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to Thee."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The second kind of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a>, which was reserved for the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, has no place in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, since the legal victims had ceased. But the third kind of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> which they had to eat with the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, is increased in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> commanded us to give to the poor not merely the tenth part, but all our surplus, according to <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse41">Luke 11:41</a>: "That which remaineth, give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>." Moreover the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> that are given to the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be dispensed by them for the use of the poor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to be more solicitous for the increase of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods in the people, than for the amassing of temporal goods: and hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> was unwilling to make use of the right given him by the Lord of receiving his livelihood from those to whom he preached the Gospel, lest he should occasion a hindrance to the Gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> [<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>. Nor did they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> who did not contribute to his upkeep, else the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> would not have omitted to reprove them. In like manner the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> rightly refrain from demanding the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, when they could not demand them without <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, on account of their having fallen into desuetude, or for some other reason. Nevertheless those who do not give <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in places where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not demand them are not in a state of damnation, unless they be obstinate, and unwilling to pay even if <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> were demanded of them.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether men are bound to pay tithes of all things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that men are not bound to give <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of all things. The paying of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> seems to be an institution of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> contains no precept about personal <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, viz. those that are payable on property acquired by one's own act, for instance by commerce or soldiering. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> on such things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is not right to make oblations of that which is ill-gotten, as stated above (Question 86, Article 3). Now oblations, being offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately, seem to be more closely connected with the divine worship than <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> which are offered to the ministers. Therefore neither should <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> be paid on ill-gotten goods.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the last chapter of Leviticus (30,32) the precept of paying <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> refers only to "corn, fruits of trees" and animals "that pass under the shepherd's rod." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> derives a revenue from other smaller things, such as the herbs that grow in his garden and so forth. Therefore neither on these things is a man bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot pay except what is in his power. Now a man does not always remain in possession of all his profit from land and stock, since sometimes he loses them by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> or robbery; sometimes they are transferred to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by sale; sometimes they are due to some other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, thus taxes are due to princes, and wages due to workmen. Therefore one ought not to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> on such like things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse22">Genesis 28:22</a>): "Of all things that Thou shalt give to me, I will offer <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to Thee."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In judging about a thing we should look to its principle. Now the principle of the payment of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> is the debt whereby carnal things are due to those who sow <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>), "If we have sown unto you <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, is it a great <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> if we reap your carnal things?" [thus implying that on the contrary "it is no great <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> if we reap your carnal things"] [The phrase in the brackets is omitted in the Leonine edition]. For this debt is the principle on which is based the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> about the payment of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. Now whatever <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> possesses comes under the designation of carnal things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> must be paid on whatever one possesses.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In accordance with the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of that people there was a special reason why the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did not include a precept about personal <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>; because, to wit, all the other tribes had certain possessions wherewith they were able to provide a sufficient livelihood for the Levites who had no possessions, but were not forbidden to make a profit out of other lawful occupations as the other <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> did. On the other hand the people of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are spread abroad throughout the world, and many of them have no possessions, but live by trade, and these would contribute nothing to the support of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ministers if they did not pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> on their trade profits. Moreover the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are more strictly forbidden to occupy themselves in money-making trades, according to <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse4">2 Timothy 2:4</a>, "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> being a soldier to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, entangleth himself with secular business." Wherefore in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> men are bound to pay personal <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, according to the custom of their country and the needs of the ministers: hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, whose words are quoted 16, qu. 1, cap. Decimae, says [Append. Serm. cclxxvii]: "Tithes must be paid on the profits of soldiering, trade or craft."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Things are ill-gotten in two ways. First, because the getting itself was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>: such, for instance, are things gotten by robbery, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> or usury: and these a man is bound to restore, and not to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> on them. If, however, a field be bought with the profits of usury, the usurer is bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> on the produce, because the latter is not gotten usuriously but given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On the other hand certain things are said to be ill-gotten, because they are gotten of a shameful <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for instance of whoredom or stage-playing, and the like. Such things a man is not bound to restore, and consequently he is bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> on them in the same way as other personal <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must not accept the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> so long as those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> remain in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, lest she appear to have a share in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: but when they have done penance, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> may be accepted from them on these things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Things directed to an end must be judged according to their fittingness to the end. Now the payment of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> is due not for its own sake, but for the sake of the ministers, to whose dignity it is unbecoming that they should demand minute things with careful exactitude, for this is reckoned <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 2). Hence the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did not order the payment of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> on such like minute things, but left it to the judgment of those who are willing to pay, because minute things are counted as nothing. Wherefore the Pharisees who claimed for themselves the perfect <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> even on these minute things: nor are they reproved by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> on that account, but only because they despised greater, i.e. <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, precepts; and rather did He show them to be deserving of praise in this particular, when He said (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse23">Matthew 23:23</a>): "These things you ought to have done," i.e. during the time of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> [Hom. xliv in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] commentary. This also seems to denote fittingness rather than <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Therefore now too men are not bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> on such minute things, except perhaps by reason of the custom of one's country.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> on what he has lost by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> or robbery, before he recovers his property: unless he has incurred the loss through his own fault or neglect, because the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought not to be the loser on that account. If he sell wheat that has not been tithed, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can command the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> due to her, both from the buyer who has a thing due to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and from the seller, because so far as he is concerned he has defrauded the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: yet if one pays, the other is not bound. Tithes are due on the fruits of the earth, in so far as these fruits are the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> do not come under a tax, nor are they subject to workmen's wages. Hence it is not right to deduct one's taxes and the wages paid to workmen, before paying <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>: but <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> must be paid before anything else on one's entire produce.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether tithes should be paid to the clergy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> should not be paid to the clergy. Tithes were paid to the Levites in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, because they had no portion in the people's possessions, according to <a href="../bible/num018.htm#verse23">Numbers 18:23-24</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the clergy have possessions not only ecclesiastical, but sometimes also patrimonial: moreover they receive first-fruits, and oblations for the living and the dead. Therefore it is unnecessary to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it sometimes happens that a man dwells in one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and farms in another; or a shepherd may take his flock within the bounds of one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> during one part of the year, and within the bounds of one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> during one part of the year, and within the bounds of another <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> during the other part of the year; or he may have his sheepfold in one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and graze the sheep in another. Now in all these and similar cases it seems impossible to decide to which clergy the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> ought to be paid. Therefore it would seem that no fixed <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> ought to be paid to the clergy.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is the general custom in certain countries for the soldiers to hold the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in fee; and certain religious receive <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. Therefore seemingly <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> are not due only to those of the clergy who have care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/num018.htm#verse21">Numbers 18:21</a>): "I have given to the sons of Levi all the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> for a possession, for the ministry wherewith they serve Me in the Tabernacle." Now the clergy are the successors of the sons of Levi in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> are due to the clergy alone.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things have to be considered with regard to <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>: namely, the right to receive <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and the things given in the name of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. The right to receive <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing, for it arises from the debt in virtue of which the ministers of the altar have a right to the expenses of their ministry, and temporal things are due to those who sow <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. This debt concerns none but the clergy who have care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and so they alone are competent to have this right.

<p>On the other hand the things given in the name of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> are material, wherefore they may come to be used by anyone, and thus it is that they fall into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, as stated above (1, ad 4), special <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> were earmarked for the assistance of the poor. But in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> are given to the clergy, not only for their own support, but also that the clergy may use them in assisting the poor. Hence they are not unnecessary; indeed Church property, oblations and first-fruits as well as <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> are all <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for this same purpose.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Personal <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> are due to the church in whose <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> a man dwells, while predial <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> seem more reasonably to belong to the church within whose bounds the land is situated. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, however, prescribes that in this matter a custom that has obtained for a long time must be observed [Cap. Cum sint, and Cap. Ad apostolicae, de Decimis, etc.]. The shepherd who grazes his flock at different seasons in two parishes, should pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> proportionately to both churches. And since the fruit of the flock is derived from the pasture, the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of the flock is due to the church in whose lands the flock grazes, rather than to the church on whose land the fold is situated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can hand over to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> the things she receives under the title of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a>, so too can she allow him to receive <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> that are yet to be paid, the right of receiving being reserved to the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The motive may be either the need of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as when <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> are due to certain soldiers through being granted to them in fee by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or it may be the succoring of the poor; thus certain <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> have been granted by way of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to certain lay religious, or to those that have no care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Some religious, however, are competent to receive <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, because they have care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the clergy also are bound to pay tithes?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> also are bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. By common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> [Cap. Cum homines, de Decimis, etc.] the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church should receive the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> on the lands which are in its territory. Now it happens sometimes that the clergy have certain lands of their own on the territory of some <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, or that one church has ecclesiastical property on the territory of another. Therefore it would seem that the clergy are bound to pay predial <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, some religious are <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; and yet they are bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to churches on account of the lands which they cultivate even with their own hands [Cap. Ex parte, and Cap. Nuper.]. Therefore it would seem that the clergy are not immune from the payment of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../bible/num018.htm#verse26">eighteenth chapter of Numbers (26,28)</a>, it is prescribed not only that the Levites should receive <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> from the people, but also that they should themselves pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>. Therefore the clergy are bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a>, no less than the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> are bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to the clergy.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> should serve not only for the support of the clergy, but also for the assistance of the poor. Therefore, if the clergy are exempt from paying <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, so too are the poor. Yet the latter is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Therefore the former is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A decretal of Pope Paschal [<a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Paschal II</a>] says: "It is a new form of exaction when the clergy demand <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> from the clergy" [Cap. Novum genus, de Decimis, etc.].

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of giving cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of receiving, as neither can the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of action be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of passion; yet it happens that one and the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is giver and receiver, even as agent and patient, on account of different <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> and from different points of view. Now <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> are due to the clergy as being ministers of the altar and sowers of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things among the people. Wherefore those members of the clergy as such, i.e. as having ecclesiastical property, are not bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>; whereas from some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> through holding property in their own right, either by inheriting it from their kindred, or by purchase, or in any other similar manner, they are bound to the payment of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>.

<p>Hence the Reply to the First Objection is clear, because the clergy like anyone else are bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> on their own lands to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, even though they be the clergy of that same church, because to possess a thing as one's private property is not the same as possessing it in common. But church lands are not tithable, even though they be within the boundaries of another <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">Religious</a> who are <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, if they have care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and dispense <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things to the people, are not bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, but they may receive them. Another reason applies to other religious, who though <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> do not dispense <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things to the people; for according to the ordinary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> they are bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, but they are somewhat exempt by reason of various concessions granted by the Apostolic See [Cap. Ex multiplici, Ex parte, and Ad audientiam, de Decimis, etc.].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> first-fruits were due to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to the Levites; and since the Levites were below the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the Lord commanded that the former should pay the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> "the tenth part of the tenth" [<a href="../bible/num018.htm#verse26">Numbers 18:26</a> instead of first-fruits: wherefore for the same reason the clergy are bound now to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a>, if he demanded them. For <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> dictates that he who has charge of the common estate of a multitude should be provided with all goods, so that he may be able to carry out whatever is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the common welfare.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Tithes should be employed for the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, through the dispensation of the clergy. Hence the poor have no reason for accepting <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, but they are bound to pay them.
