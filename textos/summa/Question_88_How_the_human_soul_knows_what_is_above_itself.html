<h1>Question 88. How the human soul knows what is above itself</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1088.htm#article1"> Can the human soul in the present state of life understand the immaterial substances called angels, in themselves?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1088.htm#article2"> Can it arrive at the knowledge thereof by the knowledge of material things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1088.htm#article3"> Is God the first object of our knowledge?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the human soul in the present state of life can understand immaterial substances in themselves?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the present state of life can understand immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> in themselves. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. ix, 3) says: "As the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> itself acquires the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of corporeal things by means of the corporeal senses, so it gains from itself the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of incorporeal things." But these are the immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind understands immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, like is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by like. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is more akin to immaterial than to material things; since its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is immaterial, as is clear from what we have said above (Question 76, Article 1). Since then our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> understands material things, much more is it able to understand immaterial things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the fact that objects which are in themselves most sensible are not most felt by us, comes from sense being corrupted by their very excellence. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not subject to such a corrupting influence from its object, as is stated De Anima iii, 4. Therefore things which are in themselves in the highest degree of intelligibility, are likewise to us most intelligible. As material things, however, are intelligible only so far as we make them actually so by abstracting them from material <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, it is clear that those <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are more intelligible in themselves whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is immaterial. Therefore they are much more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us than are material things.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> says (Metaph. ii) that "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would be frustrated in its end" were we unable to understand abstract <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, "because it would have made what in itself is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> intelligible not to be understood at all." But in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nothing is idle or purposeless. Therefore immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> can be understood by us.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, as sense is to the sensible, so is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the intelligible. But our sight can see all things corporeal, whether superior and incorruptible; or lower and corruptible. Therefore our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can understand all intelligible <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, even the superior and immaterial.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse16">Wisdom 9:16</a>): "The things that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, who shall search out?" But these <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are said to be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse10">Matthew 18:10</a>, "Their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," etc. Therefore immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> investigation.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are not only understood by us, but are the objects we understand first of all. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> taught that immaterial subsisting forms, which he called "Ideas," are the proper objects of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and thus first and "per se" understood by us; and, further, that material objects are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> inasmuch as phantasy and sense are mixed up with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Hence the purer the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is, so much the more clearly does it perceive the intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of immaterial things.

<p>But in <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> opinion, which experience corroborates, our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in its present state of life has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> relationship to the natures of material things; and therefore it can only understand by turning to the phantasms, as we have said above (Question 84, Article 7). Thus it clearly appears that immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> which do not fall under sense and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, cannot first and "per se" be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us, according to the mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which experience proves us to have.

<p>Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a> (Comment. De Anima iii) teaches that in this present life <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can in the end arrive at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> by being coupled or united to some separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, which he calls the "active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>," and which, being a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> itself, can <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> understand separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Hence, when it is perfectly united to us so that by its means we are able to understand perfectly, we also shall be able to understand separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, as in the present life through the medium of the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> united to us, we can understand material things. Now he said that the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is united to us, thus. For since we understand by means of both the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and intelligible objects, as, for instance, we understand conclusions by principles understood; it is clear that the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> must be compared to the objects understood, either as the principal agent is to the instrument, or as form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For an action is ascribed to two principles in one of these two ways; to a principal agent and to an instrument, as cutting to the workman and the saw; to a form and its subject, as heating to heat and fire. In both these ways the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can be compared to the intelligible object as perfection is to the perfectible, and as act is to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Now a subject is made perfect and receives its perfection at one and the same time, as the reception of what is actually visible synchronizes with the reception of light in the eye. Therefore the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> receives the intelligible object and the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> together; and the more numerous the intelligible objects received, so much the nearer do we come to the point of perfect union between ourselves and the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; so much so that when we understand all the intelligible objects, the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> becomes one with us, and by its instrumentality we can understand all things material and immaterial. In this he makes the ultimate <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to consist. Nor, as regards the present inquiry, does it matter whether the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in that state of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> understands separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> by the instrumentality of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as he himself maintains, or whether (as he says Alexander holds) the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can never understand separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> (because according to him it is corruptible), but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> understands separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> by means of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>This opinion, however, is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>.

<p>First, because, supposing the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to be a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, we could not formally understand by its instrumentality, for the medium of an agent's formal action consists in its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> and act, since every agent acts according to its <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, as was said of the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (70, 1).

<p>Secondly, this opinion is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, because in the above explanation, the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, supposing it to be a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, would not be joined to us in its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but only in its light, as participated in things understood; and would not extend to the other acts of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> so as to enable us to understand immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; just as when we see colors set off by the sun, we are not united to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the sun so as to act like the sun, but its light only is united to us, that we may see the colors.

<p>Thirdly, this opinion is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, because granted that, as above explained, the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were united to us in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, still it is not said that it is wholly so united in regard to one intelligible object, or two; but rather in regard to all intelligible objects. But all such objects together do not equal the force of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as it is a much greater thing to understand separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> than to understand all material things. Hence it clearly follows that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all material things would not make the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to be so united to us as to enable us by its instrumentality to understand separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p>Fourthly, this opinion is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, because it is hardly possible for anyone in this world to understand all material things: and thus no one, or very few, could reach to perfect felicity; which is against what the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 9), that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is a "kind of common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, communicable to all capable of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Further, it is unreasonable that only the few of any <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> attain to the end of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>Fifthly, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> expressly says (Ethic. i, 10), that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is "an operation according to perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>"; and after enumerating many <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the tenth book, he concludes (Ethic. i, 7) that ultimate <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consisting in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the highest things intelligible is attained through the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of wisdom, which in the sixth chapter he had named as the chief of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> clearly places the ultimate felicity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, obtainable by speculative science; and not by being united to the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as some <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a>.

<p>Sixthly, as was shown above (Question 79, Article 4), the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; but a faculty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, extending itself actively to the same objects to which the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> extends receptively; because, as is stated (De Anima iii, 5), the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is "all things <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>," and the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is "all things in act." Therefore both <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>, according to the present state of life, extend to material things only, which are made actually intelligible by the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and are received in the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence in the present state of life we cannot understand separate immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> in themselves, either by the passive or by the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> may be taken to mean that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of incorporeal things in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> can be gained by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> itself. This is so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> also say that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a principle for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. For by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> itself, it attains to some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">incorporeal substances</a>, such as is within its compass; not that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of itself gives it a perfect and absolute <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The likeness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; otherwise what Empedocles said would be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> --that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> needs to have the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of all in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> requires that the likeness of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> be in the knower, as a kind of form thereof. Now our passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in the present state of life, is such that it can be informed with similitudes abstracted from phantasms: and therefore it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> material things rather than immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There must needs be some proportion between the object and the faculty of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; such as of the active to the passive, and of perfection to the perfectible. Hence that sensible objects of great power are not grasped by the senses, is due not merely to the fact that they corrupt the organ, but also to their being improportionate to the sensitive power. And thus it is that immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are improportionate to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in our present state of life, so that it cannot understand them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This argument of the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> fails in several ways.

<p>First, because if separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are not understood by us, it does not follow that they are not understood by any <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; for they are understood by themselves, and by one another.

<p>Secondly, to be understood by us is not the end of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>: while only that is vain and purposeless, which fails to attain its end. It does not follow, therefore, that immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are purposeless, even if they are not understood by us at all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Sense <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> bodies, whether superior or inferior, in the same way, that is, by the sensible acting on the organ. But we do not understand material and immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> in the same way. The former we understand by a process of <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>, which is impossible in the case of the latter, for there are no phantasms of what is immaterial.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether our intellect can understand immaterial substances through its knowledge of material things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> through the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of material things. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. i) that "the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind cannot be raised up to immaterial <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the heavenly hierarchies, unless it is led thereto by material guidance according to its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Therefore we can be led by material things to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, science resides in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But there are <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and definitions of immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; for <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> defines an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 3); and we find <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> treated of both in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Therefore immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> can be understood by us.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> belongs to the genus of immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. But it can be understood by us through its act by which it understands material things. Therefore also other material <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> can be understood by us, through their material effects.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the only <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which cannot be comprehended through its effects is that which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> distant from them, and this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Therefore other <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> can be understood by us through material things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. i) that "intelligible things cannot be understood through sensible things, nor composite things through simple, nor incorporeal through corporeal."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a> says (De Anima iii) that a philosopher named <a href="../cathen/02150a.htm">Avempace</a> [Ibn-Badja, Arabian Philosopher; ob. 1183 taught that by the understanding of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> we can be led, according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> philosophical principles, to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. For since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is to abstract the quiddity of material things from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, anything material residing in that abstracted quiddity can again be made subject to <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>; and as the process of abstraction cannot go on forever, it must arrive at length at some immaterial quiddity, absolutely without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and this would be the understanding of immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p>Now this opinion would be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, were immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> the forms and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of these material things; as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> supposed. But supposing, on the contrary, that immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> differ altogether from the quiddity of material things, it follows that however much our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> abstract the quiddity of material things from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it could never arrive at anything akin to immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore we are not able perfectly to understand immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> through material <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> From material things we can rise to some kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of immaterial things, but not to the perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> thereof; for there is no proper and adequate proportion between material and immaterial things, and the likenesses drawn from material things for the understanding of immaterial things are very dissimilar therefrom, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. ii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Science treats of higher things principally by way of negation. Thus <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Coel. i, 3) explains the heavenly bodies by denying to them inferior corporeal properties. Hence it follows that much less can immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us in such a way as to make us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their quiddity; but we may have a scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them by way of negation and by their relation to material things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands itself through its own act of understanding, which is proper to it, showing perfectly its power and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the power and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> cannot be perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through such act, nor through any other material thing, because there is no proportion between the latter and the power of the former.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Created immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are not in the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> genus as material <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, for they do not agree in power or in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; but they belong to the same <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> genus, because even immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are in the predicament of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is distinct from their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has no connection with material things, as regards either <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> genus or <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> genus; because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in no genus, as stated above (Question 3, Article 5). Hence through the likeness derived from material things we can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something positive concerning the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to some common notion, though not according to the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; whereas we cannot acquire any such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> at all about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God is the first object known by the human mind?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind. For that object in which all others are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and by which we judge others, is the first thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us; as light is to the eye, and first principles to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things in the light of the first <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and thereby judge of all things, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 2; De Vera Relig. xxxi; [Confess. xii, 25). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a thing to be such is more so. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for He is "the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light which enlighteneth every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that cometh into this world" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John 1:9</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is our first and most <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> object.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the image is the exemplar to which it is made. But in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 4,7). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at any time" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John 1:18</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in the present state of life cannot understand even immaterial <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> (1), much less can it understand the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the uncreated <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Hence it must be said simply that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the first object of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Rather do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through creatures, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>), "the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made": while the first object of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in this life is the "quiddity of a material thing," which is the proper object of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as appears above in many passages (84, 7; 85, 8; 87, 2, ad 2)

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We see and judge of all things in the light of the first <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, forasmuch as the light itself of our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or gratuitous, is nothing else than the impression of the first <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> upon it, as stated above (Question 12, Article 2). Hence, as the light itself of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not the object it understands, much less can it be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The axiom, "Whatever <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a thing to be such is more so," must be understood of things belonging to one and the same order, as explained above (81, 2, ad 3). Other things than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> because of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not as if He were the first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> object, but because He is the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our faculty of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> a perfect image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is the perfect image of the Father, our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at once. But the image in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is imperfect; hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.
