<h1>Question 88. The general judgment, as to the time and place at which it will be</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5088.htm#article1"> Will there be a general judgment?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5088.htm#article2"> As regards the debate, will it be conducted by word of mouth?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5088.htm#article3"> Will it take place at an unknown time?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5088.htm#article4"> Will it take place in the valley of Josaphat?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there will be a general judgment?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there will not be a <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">general judgment</a>. For according to <a href="../bible/nah001.htm#verse9">Nahum 1:9</a>, following the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint version</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not judge the same thing a second time." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> judges now of man's every work, by assigning punishments and rewards to each one after death, and also by rewarding and punishing certain ones in this life for their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Therefore it would seem that there will be no other judgment.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in no judicial inquiry is the sentence carried cut before judgment is pronounced. But the sentence of the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a> on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> regards the acquisition of the kingdom or exclusion from the kingdom (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew 25:34-41</a>). Therefore since some obtain possession of the kingdom now, and some are excluded from it for ever, it would seem that there will be no other judgment.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the reason why certain things are submitted to judgment is that we may come to a decision about them. Now before the end of the world each of the damned is awarded his damnation, and each of the blessed his beatitude. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse41">Matthew 12:41</a>): "The men of Nineve shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it." Therefore there will be a judgment after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse29">John 5:29</a>): "They that have done <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things shall come forth unto the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of life, but they that have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, unto the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of judgment." Therefore it would seem that after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> there will be a judgment.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as operation refers to the beginning wherefrom things receive their being, so judgment belongs to the term, wherein they are brought to their end. Now we distinguish a twofold operation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. One is that whereby He first gave things their being, by fashioning their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and by establishing the distinctions which contribute to the perfection thereof: from this work <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is stated to have rested (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse2">Genesis 2:2</a>). His other operation is that whereby He works in governing creatures; and of this it is written (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse17">John 5:17</a>): "My Father worketh until now; and I work." Hence we distinguish in Him a twofold judgment, but in the reverse order. One corresponds to the work of governance which cannot be without judgment: and by this judgment each one is judged individually according to his works, not only as adapted to himself, but also as adapted to the government of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Hence one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reward is delayed for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse13">Hebrews 11:13-40</a>), and the punishment of one conduces to the profit of another. Consequently it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that there should be another, and that a <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">general judgment</a> corresponding on the other hand with the first formation of things in being, in order that, to wit, just as then all things proceeded immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so at length the world will receive its ultimate complement, by each one receiving finally his own personal due. Hence at this judgment the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> will be made manifest in all things, whereas now it remains hidden, for as much as at times some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are dealt with for the profit of others, otherwise than their manifest works would seem to require. For this same reason there will then be a general separation of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, because there will be no further motive for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to profit by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for the sake of which profit the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are meanwhile mingled with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, so long as this state of life is governed by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is both an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and a part of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>: wherefore a twofold judgment is due to him. One, the particular judgment, is that to which he will be subjected after death, when he will receive according as he hath done in the body [Cf. <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>, not indeed entirely but only in part since he will receive not in the body but only in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The other judgment will be passed on him as a part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>: thus a man is said to be judged according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, even when judgment is pronounced on the community of which he is a part. Hence at the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">general judgment</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> by the general separation of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, it follows that each one will be judged. And yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not judge "the same thing a second time," since He will not inflict two punishments for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the punishment which before the judgment was not inflicted completely will be completed at the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a>, after which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will be tormented at the same time in body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The sentence proper to this <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">general judgment</a> is the general separation of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, which will not precede this judgment. Yet even now, as regards the particular sentence on each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, the judgment does not at once take full effect since even the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will receive an increase of reward after the judgment, both from the added <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body and from the completion of the number of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> also will receive an increase of torment from the added punishment of the body and from the completion of the number of damned to be punished, because the more numerous those with whom they will burn, the more will they themselves burn.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">general judgment</a> will regard more directly the generality of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> than each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> to be judged, as stated above. Wherefore although before that judgment each one will be certain of his condemnation or reward, he will not be cognizant of the condemnation or reward of everyone else. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">general judgment</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the judgment will take place by word of mouth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this judgment, as regards the inquiry and sentence, will take place by word of mouth. For according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xx) "it is uncertain how many days this judgment will last." But it would not be uncertain if the things we are told will take place at the judgment were to be accomplished only in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Therefore this judgment will take place by word of mouth and not only in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxvi): "Those at least will hear the words of the Judge, who have confessed their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him by words." Now this cannot be understood as referring to the inner word, because thus all will hear the Judge's words, since all the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of other men will be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Therefore it seems that this judgment will take place by word of mouth.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will judge according to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form, so as to be visible in the body to all. Therefore in like manner it seems that He will speak with the voice of the body, so as to be heard by all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xx) that the book of life which is mentioned in <a href="../bible/rev020.htm#verse12">Apocalypse 20:12,[15]</a> "is a kind of Divine energy enabling each one to remember all his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works, and to discern them with the gaze of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, with wondrous rapidity, his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> accusing or defending his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, so that all and each will be judged at the same moment." But if each one's <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> were discussed by word of mouth, all and each could not be judged at the same moment. Therefore it would seem that this judgment will not take place by word of mouth.

<p>Further, the sentence should correspond proportionately to the evidence. Now the evidence both of accusation and of defense will be <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse15">Romans 2:15-16</a>, "Their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> bearing witness to them, and their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another in the day when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall judge the secrets of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." Therefore seemingly, this sentence and the entire judgment will take place <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is not possible to come to any certain conclusion about the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this question. It is, however, the more probable opinion that the whole of this judgment, whether as regards the inquiry, or as regards the accusation of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and the approval of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or again as regards the sentence on both, will take place <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a>. For if the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> were to be related by word of mouth, this would require an inconceivable length of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xx) that "if we suppose the book, from the pages of which all will be judged according to <a href="../bible/rev020.htm">Apocalypse 20</a>, to be a material book, who will be able to conceive its size and length? or the length of time required for the reading of a book that contains the entire life of every <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>?" Nor is less time requisite for telling by word of mouth the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, than for reading them if they were written in a material book. Hence, probably we should understand that the details set forth in <a href="../bible/mat025.htm">Matthew 25</a> will be fulfilled not by word of mouth but <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The reason why <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that "it is uncertain how many days this judgment will last" is precisely because it is not certain whether it will take place <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> or by word of mouth. For if it were to take place by word of mouth, a considerable time would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. but if <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a>, it is possible for it to be accomplished in an instant.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even if the judgment is accomplished solely in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the saying of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> stands, since though all will be cognizant of their own and of others' <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, as a result of the Divine energy which the Gospel describes as speech (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew 25:34-46</a>), nevertheless those who have had the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they received through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> words will be judged from those very words, for it is written (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse12">Romans 2:12</a>): "Whosoever have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> shall be judged by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>." Hence in a special way something will be said to those who had been believers, which will not be said to unbelievers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will appear in body, so that the Judge may be recognized in the body by all, and it is possible for this to take place suddenly. But speech which is measured by time would require an immense length of time, if the judgment took place by word of mouth.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the time of the future judgment is unknown?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the time of the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">future judgment</a> is not unknown. For just as the holy Fathers looked forward to the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">first coming</a>, so do we look forward to the second. But the holy Fathers <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the time of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">first coming</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the number of weeks mentioned in <a href="../bible/dan009.htm">Daniel 9</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> are reproached for not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming (<a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse56">Luke 12:56</a>): "You <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a>, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to discern the face of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and of the earth, but how is it that you do not discern this time?" Therefore it would seem that the time of the second coming when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will come to judgment should also be certified to us.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we arrive by means of signs at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the things signified. Now many signs of the coming judgment are declared to us in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm">Matthew 24</a>, <a href="../bible/mar013.htm">Mark 13</a>, <a href="../bible/luk021.htm">Luke 21</a>). Therefore we can arrive at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that time.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>): "It is on us ['These things . . . are written for our correction, upon whom the ends of the world are come'] that the ends of the world are come," and (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse18">1 John 2:18</a>): "Little children, it is the last hour," etc. Since then it is a long time since these things were said, it would seem that now at least we can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a> is nigh.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, there is no need for the time of the judgment to be hidden, except that each one may be careful to prepare himself for judgment, being in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the appointed time. Yet the same care would still be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> even were the time <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> for certain, because each one is uncertain about the time of his death, of which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Hesych. cxcix) that "as each one's last day finds him, so will the world's last day find him." Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for the time of the judgment to be uncertain.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse32">Mark 13:32</a>): "Of that day or hour no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>, neither the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, nor the Son, but the Father." The Son, however, is said not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in so far as He does not impart the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to us.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse2">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of the Lord</a> shall so come as a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> in the night." Therefore seemingly, as the coming of a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> in the night is altogether uncertain, the day of the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a> is altogether uncertain.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things by His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> [Cf. I, 14, 8]. Now He communicates both these things to His creatures, since He both endows some with the power of action on others whereof they are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and bestows on some the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things. But in both cases He reserves something to Himself, for He operates certain things wherein no creature co-operates with Him, and again He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> certain things which are unknown to any mere creature. Now this should apply to none more than to those things which are subject to the Divine power alone, and in which no creature co-operates with Him. Such is the end of the world when the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a> will come. For the world will come to an end by no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, even as it derived its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end of the world is fittingly reserved to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Indeed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> seems to assign this very reason when He said (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse7">Acts 1:7</a>): "It is not for you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the times or moments which the Father hath put in His own power," as though He were to say, "which are reserved to His power alone."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> At His first coming <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came secretly according to <a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse15">Isaiah 45:15</a>, "Verily Thou art a hidden <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Saviour." Hence, that He might be recognized by believers, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the time to be fixed beforehand with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. On the other hand, at the second coming, He will come openly, according to <a href="../bible/psa049.htm#verse3">Psalm 49:3</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall come manifestly." Consequently there can be no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> affecting the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His coming. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, in his letter to Hesychius concerning the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a> (Ep. cxcix), "the signs mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> do not all refer to the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">second advent</a> which will happen at the end of the world, but some of them belong to the time of the sack of Jerusalem, which is now a thing of the past, while some, in fact many of them, refer to the advent whereby He comes daily to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whom He visits spiritually when He dwells in us by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and love." Moreover, the details mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and Epistles in connection with the last advent are not sufficient to enable us to determine the time of the judgment, for the trials that are foretold as announcing the proximity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming occurred even at the time of the Early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in a degree sometimes more sometimes less marked; so that even the days of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were called the last days (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse17">Acts 2:17</a>) when <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> expounded the saying of <a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse28">Joel 2:28</a>, "It shall come to pass in the last days," etc., as referring to that time. Yet it was already a long time since then: and sometimes there were more and sometimes less afflictions in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Consequently it is impossible to decide after how long a time it will take place, nor fix the month, year, century, or thousand years as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the same book (Ep. ad Hesych. cxcix). And even if we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that at the end these calamities will be more frequent, it is impossible to fix what amount of such calamities will immediately precede the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a> or the coming of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, since even at the time of the Early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> were so bitter, and the corruptions of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> were so numerous, that some looked forward to the coming of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> as being near or imminent; as related in <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius'</a> History of the Church (vi, 7) and in <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome's</a> book De Viris Illustribus lii.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The statement, "It is the last hour" and similar expressions that are to be found in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> do not enable us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the exact length of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. For they are not intended to indicate a short length of time, but to signify the last state of the world, which is the last age of all, and it is not stated definitely how long this will last. Thus neither is fixed duration appointed to old age, which is the last age of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since sometimes it is seen to last as long as or even longer than all the previous ages, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> remarks (Qq. 83, qu. lviii). Hence also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>) disclaims the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> signification which some had given to his words, by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of the Lord</a> was already at hand.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Notwithstanding the uncertainty of death, the uncertainty of the judgment conduces to watchfulness in two ways. First, as regards the thing ignored, since its delay is equal to the length of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life, so that on either side uncertainty provokes him to greater care. Secondly, for the reason that a man is careful not only of his own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but also of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, or of his city or kingdom, or of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the length of whose duration is not dependent on the length of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life. And yet it behooves each of these to be so ordered that the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of the Lord</a> find us not unprepared.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the judgment will take place in the valley of Josaphat?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the judgment will not take place in the <a href="../cathen/08503a.htm">valley of Josaphat</a> or in the surrounding locality. For at least it will be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for those to be judged to stand on the ground, and those alone to be raised aloft whose business it will be to judge. But the whole land of promise would not be able to contain the multitude of those who are to be judged. Therefore it is impossible for the judgment to take place in the neighborhood of that valley.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form judgment is given that He may judge <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, since He was judged <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> in the court of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and bore the sentence of an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgment on <a href="../cathen/03191a.htm">Golgotha</a>. Therefore these places would be more suitably appointed for the judgment.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, clouds result from the exhalation of vapors. But then there will be no evaporation or exhalation. Therefore it will be impossible for the just to be "taken up . . . in the clouds to meet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, into the air": and consequently it will be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to be on the earth, so that a much larger place than this valley will be required.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joe003.htm#verse2">Joel 3:2</a>): "I will gather together all nations and will bring them down into the <a href="../cathen/08503a.htm">valley of Josaphat</a>, and I will plead with them there."

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse11">Acts 1:11</a>): "(This <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>) . . . shall so come as you have seen Him going into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Now He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a> from <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount Olivet</a> which overlooks the <a href="../cathen/08503a.htm">valley of Josaphat</a>. Therefore He will come to judge in the neighborhood of that place.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with any great <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> the manner in which this judgment will take place, nor how men will gather together to the place of judgment; but it may be gathered from <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> that in all probability He will descend in the neighborhood of <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount Olivet</a>, even as He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> from there, so as to show that He who descends is the same as He who <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A great multitude can be enclosed in a small space. And all that is required is that in the neighborhood of that locality there be a space, however great, to contain the multitude of those who are to be judged, provided that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> can be seen thence since being raised in the air, and shining with exceeding <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, He will be visible from a great distance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although through being sentenced <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> His judiciary power, He will not judge with the appearance of infirmity wherein He was judged <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, but under the appearance of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> wherein He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> to the Father. Hence the place of His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension</a> is more suitable to the judgment than the place where He was condemned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the opinion of some the name of clouds is here given to certain condensations of the light shining from the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and not to evaporations from earth and water. Or we may say that those clouds will be produced by Divine power in order to show the parallel between His coming to judge and His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension</a>; so that He Who <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> in a cloud may come to judgment in a cloud.

<p>Again the cloud on account of its refreshing influence indicates the mercy of the Judge.
