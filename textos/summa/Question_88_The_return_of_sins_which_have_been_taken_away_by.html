<h1>Question 88. The return of sins which have been taken away by Penance</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4088.htm#article1"> Do sins which have been taken away by Penance return simply through a subsequent sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4088.htm#article2"> More specially as regards certain sins, do they return, in a way, on account of ingratitude?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4088.htm#article3"> Does the debt of punishment remain the same for sins thus returned?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4088.htm#article4"> Is this ingratitude, on account of which sins return, a special sin?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether sins once forgiven return through a subsequent sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> once forgiven return through a subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bapt. contra Donat. i, 12): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> teaches most explicitly in the Gospel that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which have been forgiven return, when fraternal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> ceases, in the example of the servant from whom his master exacted the payment of the debt already forgiven, because he had refused to forgive the debt of his fellow-servant." Now fraternal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is destroyed through each mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> already taken away through Penance, return through each subsequent mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse24">Luke 11:24</a>, "I will return into my house, whence I came out," <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says: "This verse should make us tremble, we should not endeavor to explain it away lest through carelessness we give place to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which we thought to have been taken away, and become its <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> once more." Now this would not be so unless it returned. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> returns after once being taken away by Penance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the Lord said (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse24">Ezekiel 18:24</a>): "If the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turn himself away from his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and do <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> . . . all his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered." Now among the other "justices" which he had done, is also his previous penance, since it was said above (Question 85, Article 3) that penance is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore when one who has done penance, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, his previous penance, whereby he received forgiveness of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is not imputed to him. Therefore his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> return.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are covered by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse7">Romans 4:7</a>) where he quotes <a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse1">Psalm 31:1</a>: "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are covered." But a subsequent mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> takes away <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed previously, become uncovered: and so, seemingly, they return.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse29">Romans 11:29</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and the calling of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are without repentance." Now the penitent's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are taken away by a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which have been taken away do not return through a subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> repented His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of forgiveness.

<p>Moreover, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Lib. Resp. Prosperi i [Cf. Prosper, Responsiones ad Capitula Gallorum ii): "When he that turns away from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, comes to the end of this life a stranger to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whither does he go, except to perdition? Yet he does not fall back into that which had been forgiven, nor will he be condemned for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 86, Article 4), mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> contains two things, aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and adherence to a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now, in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whatever attaches to the aversion, is, considered in itself, common to all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turns away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that, in consequence, the stain resulting from the privation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and the debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a> are common to all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. This is what is meant by what is written (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse10">James 2:10</a>): "Whosoever . . . shall offend in one point, is become guilty of all." On the other hand, as regards their adherence they are different from, and sometimes contrary to one another. Hence it is evident, that on the part of the adherence, a subsequent mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the return of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> previously dispelled, else it would follow that by a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of wastefulness a man would be brought back to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or disposition of avarice previously dispelled, so that one contrary would be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another, which is impossible. But if in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> we consider that which attaches to the aversion absolutely, then a subsequent mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> [<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the return of that which was comprised in the mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> before they were pardoned, in so far as the subsequent mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>] [The words in brackets are omitted in the Leonine edition.] deprives <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and makes him deserving of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>, just as he was before. Nevertheless, since the aversion of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is [in a way, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the adherence, those things which attach to the aversion are*] diversified somewhat in relation to various adherences, as it were to various <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, so that there will be a different aversion, a different stain, a different debt of punishment, according to the different acts of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from which they arise; hence the question is moved whether the stain and the debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by acts of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> previously pardoned, return through a subsequent mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Accordingly some have maintained that they return simply even in this way. But this is impossible, because what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has done cannot be undone by the work of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now the pardon of the previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was a work of Divine mercy, so that it cannot be undone by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse3">Romans 3:3</a>: "Shall their unbelief make the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without effect?"

<p>Wherefore others who maintained the possibility of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> returning, said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pardons the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of a penitent who will afterwards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> again, not according to His foreknowledge, but only according to His present <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: since He foresees that He will punish such a man <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and yet, by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, He makes him righteous for the present. But this cannot stand: because if a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be placed absolutely, its effect is placed absolutely; so that if the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were effected by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not absolutely but under some <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> dependent on some future event, it would follow that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are not the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, as being derogatory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p>Consequently it is in no way possible for the stain of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the debt of punishment incurred thereby, to return, as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by those acts. Yet it may happen that a subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act virtually contains the debt of punishment due to the previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as when a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> a second time, for this very reason he seems to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more grievously than before, as stated in <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse5">Romans 2:5</a>: "According to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath," from the mere fact, namely, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, which waits for us to repent, is despised. And so much the more is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> despised, if the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed a second time after having been forgiven, as it is a greater favor for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be forgiven than for the sinner to be endured.

<p>Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which follows repentance brings back, in a sense, the debt of punishment due to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> previously forgiven, not as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> already forgiven but as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by this last <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being committed, on account of its being aggravated in view of those previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. This means that those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> return, not simply, but in a restricted sense, viz., in so far as they are virtually contained in the subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> seems to refer to the return of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as to the debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> considered in itself, namely, that he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> after doing penance incurs a debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, just as before, but not altogether for the same "reason." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, after saying (Lib. Resp. Prosperi i [Cf. Prosper, Responsiones ad Capitula Gallorum ii) that "he does not fall back into that which was forgiven, nor will he be condemned for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>," adds: "Nevertheless, for these last <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> he will be condemned to the same death, which he deserved to suffer for the former," because he incurs the punishment of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death which he deserved for his previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By these words <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> means that the guilt already forgiven enslaves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not by the return of his former debt of punishment, but by the repetition of his act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The effect of a subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is that the former "justices" are not remembered, in so far as they were deserving of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, but not in so far as they were a hindrance to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently if a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally after making restitution, he does not become guilty as though he had not paid back what he owed; and much less is penance previously done forgotten as to the pardon of the guilt, since this is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather than of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> removes the stain and the debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> simply; but it covers the past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> acts, lest, on their account, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> deprive <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and judge him deserving of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>; and what <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has once done, endures for ever.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether sins that have been forgiven, return through ingratitude which is shown especially in four kinds of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not return through ingratitude, which is shown especially in four kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, viz., <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of one's neighbor, apostasy from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, contempt of confession and regret for past repentance, and which have been expressed in the following verse: <blockquote> "Fratres odit, apostata fit, spernitque, fateri,<br> Poenituisse piget, pristina culpa redit." </blockquote> For the more grievous the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> after one has received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of pardon, the greater the ingratitude. But there are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievous than these, such as <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> already pardoned do not return through ingratitude as manifested in these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, any more than as shown in other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus</a> says: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> delivered the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> servant to the torturers, until he should pay the whole debt, because a man will be deemed punishable not only for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> he commits after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, but also for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> which was taken away when he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." Now venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are reckoned among our debts, since we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in their regard: "Forgive us our trespasses [debita]." Therefore they too return through ingratitude; and, in like manner seemingly, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> already pardoned return through venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and not only through those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mentioned above.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, ingratitude is all the greater, according as one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> after receiving a greater favor. Now innocence whereby one avoids <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a Divine favor, for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. ii): "Whatever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> I have avoided committing, I owe it to Thy <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Now innocence is a greater <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, than even the forgiveness of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed after innocence is no less an ingratitude to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed after repentance, so that seemingly ingratitude in respect of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is not the chief <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> returning.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xviii [Cf. Dial. iv): "It is evident from the words of the Gospel that if we do not forgive from our hearts the offenses committed against us, we become once more accountable for what we rejoiced in as forgiven through Penance": so that ingratitude implied in the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of one's brother is a special <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the return of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> already forgiven: and the same seems to apply to the others.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> pardoned through Penance are said to return, in so far as their debt of punishment, by reason of ingratitude, is virtually contained in the subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now one may be guilty of ingratitude in two ways: first by doing something against the favor received, and, in this way, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ungrateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whereby he offends <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who forgave his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so that by every subsequent mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> previously pardoned return, on account of the ingratitude. Secondly, one is guilty of ingratitude, by doing something not only against the favor itself, but also against the form of the favor received. If this form be considered on the part of the benefactor, it is the remission of something due to him; wherefore he who does not forgive his brother when he asks pardon, and persists in his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, acts against this form. If, however, this form be taken in regard to the penitent who receives this favor, we find on his part a twofold movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. The first is the movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and against this a man acts by apostatizing from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The second is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and is the act of penance. This act consists first, as we have stated above (85, 2,5) in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> detestation of his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and against this a man acts when he regrets having done penance. Secondly, the act of penance consists in the penitent purposing to subject himself to the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by confession, according to <a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse5">Psalm 31:5</a>: "I said: I will confess against myself my <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to the Lord: and Thou hast forgiven the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>": and against this a man acts when he scorns to confess as he had purposed to do.

<p>Accordingly it is said that the ingratitude of sinners is a special <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the return of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> previously forgiven.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This is not said of these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as though they were more grievous than others, but because they are more directly opposed to the favor of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> return in the way explained above, just as mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do, in so far as the favor conferred by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in forgiving those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is despised. A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not, however, incur ingratitude by committing a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> venially <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not act against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but apart from Him, wherefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> nowise <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the return of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> already forgiven.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A favor can be weighed in two ways. First by the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the favor itself, and in this way innocence is a greater favor from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than penance, which is called the second plank after shipwreck (cf. 84, 6). Secondly, a favor may be weighed with regard to the recipient, who is less worthy, wherefore a greater favor is bestowed on him, so that he is the more ungrateful if he scorns it. In this way the favor of the pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is greater when bestowed on one who is altogether unworthy, so that the ingratitude which follows is all the greater.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the debt of punishment that arises through ingratitude in respect of a subsequent sin is as great as that of the sins previously pardoned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the debt of punishment arising through ingratitude in respect of a subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is as great as that of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> previously pardoned. Because the greatness of the favor of the pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is according to the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> pardoned, and so too, in consequence, is the greatness of the ingratitude whereby this favor is scorned. But the greatness of the consequent debt of punishment is in accord with the greatness of the ingratitude. Therefore the debt of punishment arising through ingratitude in respect of a subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is as great as the debt of punishment due for all the previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to offend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than to offend <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> who is freed by his master returns to the same state of slavery from which he was freed, or even to a worse state. Much more therefore he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> after being freed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, returns to the debt of as great a punishment as he had incurred before.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse34">Matthew 18:34</a>) that "his lord being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, delivered him" (whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> returned to him on account of his ingratitude) "to the torturers, until he paid all the debt." But this would not be so unless the debt of punishment incurred through ingratitude were as great as that incurred through all previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore an equal debt of punishment returns through ingratitude.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>): "According to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall the measure also of the stripes be," whence it is evident that a great debt of punishment does not arise from a slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But sometimes a subsequent mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is much less grievous than any one of those previously pardoned. Therefore the debt of punishment incurred through subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is not equal to that of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> previously forgiven.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have maintained that the debt of punishment incurred through ingratitude in respect of a subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is equal to that of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> previously pardoned, in addition to the debt proper to this subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But there is no need for this, because, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the debt of punishment incurred by previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> does not return on account of a subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as resulting from the acts of the subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore the amount of the debt that returns must be according to the gravity of the subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>It is possible, however, for the gravity of the subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to equal the gravity of all previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But it need not always be so, whether we speak of the gravity which a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has from its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> (since the subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be one of simple fornication, while the previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were adulteries, murders, or <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrileges</a>); or of the gravity which it incurs through the ingratitude connected with it. For it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the measure of ingratitude should be exactly equal to the measure of the favor received, which latter is measured according to the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> previously pardoned. Because it may happen that in respect of the same favor, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is very ungrateful, either on account of the intensity of his scorn for the favor received, or on account of the gravity of the offense committed against the benefactor, while another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is slightly ungrateful, either because his scorn is less intense, or because his offense against the benefactor is less grave. But the measure of ingratitude is proportionately equal to the measure of the favor received: for supposing an equal contempt of the favor, or an equal offense against the benefactor, the ingratitude will be so much the greater, as the favor received is greater.

<p>Hence it is evident that the debt of punishment incurred by a subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> need not always be equal to that of previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but it must be in proportion thereto, so that the more numerous or the greater the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> previously pardoned, the greater must be the debt of punishment incurred by any subsequent mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The favor of the pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> takes its absolute <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> previously pardoned: but the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of ingratitude does not take its absolute <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> from the measure of the favor bestowed, but from the measure of the contempt or of the offense, as stated above: and so the objection does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> who has been given his freedom is not brought back to his previous state of slavery for any kind of ingratitude, but only when this is grave.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He whose forgiven <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> return to him on account of subsequent ingratitude, incurs the debt for all, in so far as the measure of his previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is contained proportionally in his subsequent ingratitude, but not absolutely, as stated above.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the ingratitude whereby a subsequent sin causes the return of previous sins, is a special sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the ingratitude, whereby a subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the return of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> previously forgiven, is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the giving of thanks belongs to counterpassion which is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> shows (Ethic. v, 5). But <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore this ingratitude is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Tully says (De Inv. Rhet. ii) that thanksgiving is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But ingratitude is opposed to thanksgiving. Therefore ingratitude is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a special effect proceeds from a special <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now ingratitude has a special effect, viz. the return, after a fashion, of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> already forgiven. Therefore ingratitude is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which is a sequel to every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now by any mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever, a man becomes ungrateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as evidenced from what has been said (1). Therefore ingratitude is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The ingratitude of the sinner is sometimes a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and sometimes it is not, but a circumstance arising from all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in common committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according to the sinner's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 2) that "he who commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in order to steal is a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> rather than an adulterer."

<p>If, therefore, a sinner commits a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the favor received from Him, that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is drawn to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of ingratitude, and in this way a sinner's ingratitude is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If, however, a man, while intending to commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, is not withheld from it on account of its implying contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his ingratitude will not be a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but will be drawn to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as a circumstance thereof. And, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Nat. et Grat. xxix), not every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> implies contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His commandments. Therefore it is evident that the sinner's ingratitude is sometimes a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, sometimes not.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections: for the first (three) objections <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that ingratitude is in itself a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; while the last objection proves that ingratitude, as included in every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.
