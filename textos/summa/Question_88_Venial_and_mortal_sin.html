<h1>Question 88. Venial and mortal sin</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2088.htm#article1"> Is venial sin fittingly condivided with mortal sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2088.htm#article2"> Do they differ generically?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2088.htm#article3"> Is venial sin a disposition to mortal sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2088.htm#article4"> Can a venial sin become mortal?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2088.htm#article5"> Can a venial sin become mortal by reason of an aggravating circumstance?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2088.htm#article6"> Can a mortal sin become venial?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether venial sin is fittingly condivided with mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is unfittingly condivided with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xxii, 27): "Sin is a word, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> or desire contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." But the fact of being against the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> makes a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be mortal. Consequently every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is mortal. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not condivided with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse31">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>): "Whether you eat or drink, or whatever else you do; do all to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> breaks this commandment, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not done for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Consequently, since to break a commandment is to commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it seems that whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever cleaves to a thing by love, cleaves either as enjoying it, or as using it, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Doctr. Christ. i, 3,4). But no <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, cleaves to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as using it: because he does not refer it to that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which gives us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which, properly speaking, is to use, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Doctr. Christ. i, 3,4). Therefore whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> enjoys a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now "to enjoy what we should use is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> perverseness," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> again says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 30). Therefore, since "perverseness" [The <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> 'pervertere' means to overthrow, to destroy, hence 'perversion' of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.] denotes a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it seems that whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whoever approaches one term, from that very fact turns away from the opposite. Now whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, approaches a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and, consequently turns away from the immutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is unfittingly condivided with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xli in Joan.), that "a crime is one that <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> damnation, and a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, one that does not." But a crime denotes a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is fittingly condivided with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Certain terms do not appear to be mutually opposed, if taken in their proper sense, whereas they are opposed if taken metaphorically: thus "to smile" is not opposed to "being dry"; but if we speak of the smiling meadows when they are decked with flowers and fresh with green hues this is opposed to drought. In like manner if mortal be taken literally as referring to the death of the body, it does not imply opposition to venial, nor belong to the same genus. But if mortal be taken metaphorically, as applied to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is opposed to that which is venial.

<p>For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, being a sickness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (71, 1, ad 3; 72, 5; 74, 9, ad 2), is said to be mortal by comparison with a disease, which is said to be mortal, through <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> an irreparable defect consisting in the corruption of a principle, as stated above (Question 72, Article 5). Now the principle of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, which is a life in accord with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is the order to the last end, as stated above (72, 5; 87, 3): and if this order be corrupted, it cannot be repaired by any intrinsic principle, but by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, as stated above (Question 87, Article 3), because disorders in things referred to the end, are repaired through the end, even as an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about conclusions can be repaired through the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the principles. Hence the defect of order to the last end cannot be repaired through something else as a higher principle, as neither can an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about principles. Wherefore such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are called mortal, as being irreparable. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which imply a disorder in things referred to the end, the order to the end itself being preserved, are reparable. These <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are called venial: because a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> receives its acquittal [veniam] when the debt of punishment is taken away, and this ceases when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> ceases, as explained above (Question 87, Article 6).

<p>Accordingly, mortal and venial are mutually opposed as reparable and irreparable: and I say this with reference to the intrinsic principle, but not to the Divine power, which can repair all diseases, whether of the body or of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is fittingly condivided with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The division of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> into venial and mortal is not a division of a genus into its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which have an equal share of the generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: but it is the division of an analogous term into its parts, of which it is predicated, of the one first, and of the other afterwards. Consequently the perfect notion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> gives, applies to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On the other hand, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is called a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in reference to an imperfect notion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and in relation to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: even as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is called a being, in relation to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, in reference to the imperfect notion of being. For it is not "against" the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, since he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> venially neither does what the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> forbids, nor omits what the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> prescribes to be done; but he acts "beside" the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, through not observing the mode of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> intends.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This precept of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is affirmative, and so it does not bind for all times. Consequently everyone who does not actually refer all his actions to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not therefore act against this precept. In order, therefore, to avoid mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> each time that one fails actually to refer an action to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, it is enough to refer oneself and all that one has to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>. Now venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> excludes only actual reference of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and not <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> reference: because it does not exclude <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which refers <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>. Therefore it does not follow that he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> venially, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> venially, cleaves to temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not as enjoying it, because he does not fix his end in it, but as using it, by referring it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not actually but <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not considered to be a term in contraposition to the immutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, unless one's end is fixed therein: because what is referred to the end has not the character of finality.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether mortal and venial sin differ generically?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> do not differ generically, so that some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be generically mortal, and some generically venial. Because <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are considered to be generically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> according to their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or object, as stated above (Question 18, Article 2). Now either mortal or venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be committed in regard to any object or <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can love any mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, either less than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which may be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or more than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> do not differ generically.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as stated above (1; 72, 5; 87, 3), a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is called mortal when it is irreparable, venial when it can be repaired. Now irreparability belongs to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, which, according to some, is irremissible: whereas reparability belongs to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed through weakness or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, which are remissible. Therefore mortal and venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> differ as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> differs from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through weakness or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. But, in this respect, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> differ not in genus but in <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as stated above (77, 8, ad 1). Therefore venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> do not differ generically.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it was stated above (74, 3, ad 3; 10) that sudden movements both of the sensuality and of the reason are venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But sudden movements occur in every kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are generically venial.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, in a sermon on <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> (De Sanctis, serm. xli), enumerates certain generic venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and certain generic mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is so called from "venia" [pardon]. Consequently a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be called venial, first of all, because it has been pardoned: thus <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says that "penance makes every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venial": and this is called venial "from the result." Secondly, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is called venial because it does not contain anything either partially or totally, to prevent its being pardoned: partially, as when a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> contains something diminishing its guilt, e.g. a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through weakness or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: and this is called venial "from the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>": totally, through not destroying the order to the last end, wherefore it deserves temporal, but not <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>. It is of this venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that we wish to speak now.

<p>For as regards the first two, it is evident that they have no determinate genus: whereas venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, taken in the third sense, can have a determinate genus, so that one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be venial generically, and another generically mortal, according as the genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of an act is determined by its object. For, when the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is directed to a thing that is in itself contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to his last end, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is mortal by reason of its object. Consequently it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generically, whether it be contrary to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, perjury, and the like, or against the love of one's neighbor, e.g. <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and such like: wherefore such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are mortal by reason of their genus. Sometimes, however, the sinner's <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is directed to a thing containing a certain inordinateness, but which is not contrary to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and one's neighbor, e.g. an idle word, excessive laughter, and so forth: and such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are venial by reason of their genus.

<p>Nevertheless, since moral acts derive their character of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, not only from their objects, but also from some disposition of the agent, as stated above (18, A4,6), it happens sometimes that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is venial generically by reason of its object, becomes mortal on the part of the agent, either because he fixes his last end therein, or because he directs it to something that is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in its own genus; for example, if a man direct an idle word to the commission of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. In like manner it may happen, on the part of the agent, that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generically mortal because venial, by reason of the act being imperfect, i.e. not deliberated by reason, which is the proper principle of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> act, as we have said above in reference to sudden movements of unbelief.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The very fact that anyone chooses something that is contrary to divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, proves that he prefers it to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and consequently, that he loves it more than he loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it belongs to the genus of some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which are of themselves contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, that something is loved more than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that they are mortal by reason of their genus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are venial from their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are venial by reason of the imperfection of the act.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether venial sin is a disposition to mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not a disposition to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For one contrary does not dispose to another. But venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are condivided as contrary to one another, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not a disposition to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an act disposes to something of like <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, wherefore it is stated in Ethic. ii, 1,2, that "from like acts like dispositions and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are engendered." But mortal and venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> differ in genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not dispose to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is called venial because it disposes to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it follows that whatever disposes to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work disposes to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his Rule (Ep. ccxi) that "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> lies in wait for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works that it may destroy them." Therefore even <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works would be venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which is absurd.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir019.htm#verse1">Sirach 19:1</a>): "He that contemneth small things shall fall by little and little." Now he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> venially seems to contemn small things. Therefore by little and little he is disposed to fall away together into mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A disposition is a kind of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; wherefore as there is a twofold manner of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, so is there a twofold manner of disposition. For there is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which moves directly to the production of the effect, as a hot thing heats: and there is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which moves indirectly, by removing an obstacle, as he who displaces a pillar is said to displace the stone that rests on it. Accordingly an act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> disposes to something in two ways. First, directly, and thus it disposes to an act of like <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. In this way, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generically venial does not, primarily and of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, dispose to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generically mortal, for they differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Nevertheless, in this same way, a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can dispose, by way of consequence, to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is mortal on the part of the agent: because the disposition or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> may be so far strengthened by acts of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> increases, and the sinner fixes his end in that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: since the end for one who has a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as such, is to work according to that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; and the consequence will be that, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> often venially, he becomes disposed to a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Secondly, a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> disposes to something by removing an obstacle thereto. In this way a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generically venial can dispose to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generically mortal. Because he that commits a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generically venial, turns aside from some particular order; and through accustoming his will not to be subject to the due order in lesser matters, is disposed not to subject his will even to the order of the last end, by choosing something that is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in its genus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are not condivided in contrariety to one another, as though they were <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of one genus, as stated above (1, ad 1), but as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is condivided with <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Wherefore an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> can be a disposition to a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, so can a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> dispose to mortal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not like mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; but it is in genus, inasmuch as they both imply a defect of due order, albeit in different ways, as stated (1,2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work is not, of itself, a disposition to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but it can be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or occasion of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; whereas a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, disposes to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a venial sin can become mortal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can become a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in explaining the words of <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse36">John 3:36</a>: "He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not the Son, shall not see life," says (Tract. xii in Joan.): "The slightest," i.e. venial, "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> kill if we make little of them." Now a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is called mortal through <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can become mortal.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a movement in the sensuality before the consent of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but after consent, is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (74, 8, ad 2). Therefore a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can become mortal.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> differ as curable and incurable disease, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But a curable disease may become incurable. Therefore a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may become mortal.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a disposition may become a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a disposition to mortal, as stated (3). Therefore a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can become mortal.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The fact of a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> becoming a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be understood in three ways. First, so that the same identical act be at first a venial, and then a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This is impossible: because a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, like any moral act, consists chiefly in an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: so that an act is not one morally, if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be changed, although the act be continuous physically. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be not changed, it is not possible for a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to become mortal.

<p>Secondly, this may be taken to mean that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generically venial, becomes mortal. This is possible, in so far as one may fix one's end in that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or direct it to some mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as end, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>).

<p>Thirdly, this may be understood in the sense of many venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> constituting one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If this be taken as meaning that many venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> added together make one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because all the venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the world cannot incur a debt of punishment equal to that of one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This is evident as regards the duration of the punishment, since mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> incurs a debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, while venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> incurs a debt of temporal punishment, as stated above (87, A3,5). It is also evident as regards the pain of loss, because mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> deserve to be punished by the privation of seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to which no other punishment is comparable, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> states (Hom. xxiv in Matth.). It is also evident as regards the pain of sense, as to the remorse of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; although as to the pain of fire, the punishments may perhaps not be improportionate to one another.

<p>If, however, this be taken as meaning that many venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> make one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> dispositively, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as was shown above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>) with regard to the two different manners of disposition, whereby venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> disposes to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is referring to the fact of many venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> making one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> dispositively.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The same movement of the sensuality which preceded the consent of reason can never become a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but the movement of the reason in consenting is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Disease of the body is not an act, but an abiding disposition; wherefore, while remaining the same disease, it may undergo change. On the other hand, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a transient act, which cannot be taken up again: so that in this respect the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A disposition that becomes a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, is like an imperfect thing in the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; thus imperfect science, by being perfected, becomes a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. On the other hand, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a disposition to something differing generically, even as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> which disposes to a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, into which it is never changed.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a circumstance can make a venial sin to be mortal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a circumstance can make a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortal. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> (De Sanctis, serm. xli) that "if <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> continue for a long time, or if drunkenness be frequent, they become mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and drunkenness are not mortal but venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> generically, else they would always be mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore a circumstance makes a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be mortal.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says ( Sentent. ii, D, 24) that delectation, if morose [See 74, 6], is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that if it be not morose, it is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now moroseness is a circumstance. Therefore a circumstance makes a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be mortal.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> differ more than venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, both of which are generically <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But a circumstance makes a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as when a man gives an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for vainglory. Much more, therefore, can it make a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be mortal.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Since a circumstance is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, its <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> cannot exceed that of the act itself, derived from the act's genus, because the subject always excels its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. If, therefore, an act be venial by reason of its genus, it cannot become mortal by reason of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>: since, in a way, mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> surpasses the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as is evident from what has been said (72, 5, ad 1; 87, 5, ad 1).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (7, 1; 18, 5, ad 4; A10,11), when we were treating of circumstances, a circumstance, as such, is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> of the moral act: and yet a circumstance may happen to be taken as the specific difference of a moral act, and then it loses its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of circumstance, and constitutes the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the moral act. This happens in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> when a circumstance adds the deformity of another genus; thus when a man has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> than his wife, the deformity of his act is opposed to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; but if this other be another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> wife, there is an additional deformity opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which forbids one to take what belongs to another; and accordingly this circumstance constitutes a new <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.

<p>It is, however, impossible for a circumstance to make a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> become mortal, unless it adds the deformity of another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For it has been stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) that the deformity of a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in a disorder affecting things that are referred to the end, whereas the deformity of a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in a disorder about the last end. Consequently it is evident that a circumstance cannot make a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be mortal, so long as it remains a circumstance, but only when it transfers the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and becomes, as it were, the specific difference of the moral act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Length of time is not a circumstance that draws a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, nor is frequency or custom, except perhaps by something <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> supervening. For an action does not acquire a new <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> through being repeated or prolonged, unless by chance something supervene in the repeated or prolonged act to change its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, e.g. disobedience, contempt, or the like.

<p>We must therefore reply to the objection by saying that since <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> tending to the hurt of one's neighbor, if the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> movement tend to a hurt which is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generically, such as <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> or robbery, that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> will be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generically: and if it be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this will be due to the imperfection of the act, in so far as it is a sudden movement of the sensuality: whereas, if it last a long time, it returns to its generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, through the consent of reason. If, on the other hand, the hurt to which the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> movement tends, is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generically venial, for instance, if a man be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with someone, so as to wish to say some trifling word in jest that would hurt him a little, the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> will not be mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, however long it last, unless perhaps <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; for instance, if it were to give rise to great <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> or something of the kind.

<p>With regard to drunkenness we reply that it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by reason of its genus; for, that a man, without <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, and through the mere <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of wine, make himself unable to use his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whereby he is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and avoids committing many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is expressly contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. That it be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is due some sort of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or weakness, as when a man is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the strength of the wine, or of his own unfitness, so that he has no thought of getting drunk, for in that case the drunkenness is not imputed to him as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only the excessive drink. If, however, he gets drunk frequently, this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> no longer avails as an excuse, for his will seems to choose to give way to drunkenness rather than to refrain from excess of wine: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> returns to its specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Morose delectation is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> except in those matters which are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> generically. In such matters, if the delectation be not morose, there is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through imperfection of the act, as we have said with regard to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> (ad 1): because <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is said to be lasting, and delectation to be morose, on account of the approval of the deliberating reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A circumstance does not make a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, unless it constitute the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as we have stated above (18, 5, ad 4).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether a mortal sin can become venial?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can become venial. Because venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is equally distant from mortal, as mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is from venial. But a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can become mortal, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). Therefore also a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can become venial.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are said to differ in this, that he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally loves a creature more than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> venially loves the creature less than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now it may happen that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in committing a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generically mortal, loves a creature less than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for instance, if anyone being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that simple fornication is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and contrary to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, commits the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of fornication, yet so as to be ready, for the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to refrain from that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that by committing it he was acting counter to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore his will be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and accordingly a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can become venial.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as stated above (5, Objection 3), <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is more distant from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, than venial from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But an act which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, can become <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; thus to kill a man may be an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as when a judge condemns a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> to death. Much more therefore can a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> become venial.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> An <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> thing can never become temporal. But mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deserves <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, whereas venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deserves temporal punishment. Therefore a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can never become venial.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Venial and mortal differ as perfect and imperfect in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (1, ad 1). Now the imperfect can become perfect, by some sort of addition: and, consequently, a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can become mortal, by the addition of some deformity pertaining to the genus of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as when a man utters an idle word for the purpose of fornication. On the other hand, the perfect cannot become imperfect, by addition; and so a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot become venial, by the addition of a deformity pertaining to the genus of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not diminished if a man commit fornication in order to utter an idle word; rather is it aggravated by the additional deformity.

<p>Nevertheless a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is generically mortal, can become venial by reason of the imperfection of the act, because then it does not completely fulfil the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of a moral act, since it is not a deliberate, but a sudden act, as is evident from what we have said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). This happens by a kind of subtraction, namely, of deliberate reason. And since a moral act takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from deliberate reason, the result is that by such a subtraction the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the act is destroyed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Venial differs from mortal as imperfect from perfect, even as a boy differs from a man. But the boy becomes a man and not vice versa. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> be such as to excuse <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether, as the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of a madman or an imbecile, then he that commits fornication in a state of such <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, commits no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> either mortal or venial. But if the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> be not invincible, then the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> itself is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and contains within itself the lack of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in so far as a man neglects to learn those things whereby he can safeguard himself in the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Mendacium vii), "those things which are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in themselves, cannot be well done for any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end." Now <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is the slaying of the innocent, and this can nowise be well done. But, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Lib. Arb. i, 4,5), the judge who sentences a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> to death, or the soldier who slays the enemy of the common weal, are not murderers.
