<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a vow consists in a mere purpose of the will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> consists in nothing but a purpose of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. According to some [<a href="../cathen/15631d.htm">William of Auxerre</a>, Sum. Aur. III, xxviii, qu. 1; <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>, Sent. iv, D, 38, "a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a conception of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purpose after a firm deliberation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, whereby a man binds himself before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to do or not to do a certain thing." But the conception of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purpose and so forth, may consist in a mere movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> consists in a mere purpose of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the very word <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> seems to be derived from "voluntas" [will], for one is said to do a thing "proprio voto" [by one's own <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>] when one does it <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>. Now to "purpose" is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, while to "promise" is an act of the reason. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> consists in a mere act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke 9:62</a>): "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Now from the very fact that a man has a purpose of doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, he puts his hand to the plough. Consequently, if he look back by desisting from his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purpose, he is not fit for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. Therefore by a mere <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purpose a man is bound before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even without making a promise; and consequently it would seem that a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> consists in a mere purpose of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes 5:3</a>): "If thou hast vowed anything to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, defer not to pay it, for an unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth Him." Therefore to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is to promise, and a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a promise.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> denotes a binding to do or omit some particular thing. Now one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> binds himself to another by means of a promise, which is an act of the reason to which faculty it belongs to direct. For just as a man by commanding or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, directs, in a fashion, what others are to do for him, so by promising he directs what he himself is to do for another. Now a promise between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can only be expressed in words or any other outward signs; whereas a promise can be made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the mere inward thought, since according to <a href="../bible/1sa016.htm#verse7">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, "Man seeth those things that appear, but the Lord beholdeth the heart." Yet we express words outwardly sometimes, either to arouse ourselves, as was stated above with regard to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (83, 12), or to call others to witness, so that one may refrain from breaking the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, not only through fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also through respect of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Now a promise is the outcome from a purpose of doing something: and a purpose presupposes deliberation, since it is the act of a deliberate will. Accordingly three things are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: the first is deliberation. the second is a purpose of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; and the third is a promise, wherein is completed the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Sometimes, however, two other things are added as a sort of confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, namely, pronouncement by word of mouth, according to <a href="../bible/psa065.htm#verse13">Psalm 65:13</a>, "I will pay Thee my <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> which my lips have uttered"; and the witnessing of others. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. iv, D, 38) that a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is "the witnessing of a spontaneous promise and ought to be made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and about things relating to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": although the "witnessing" may strictly refer to the inward protestation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The conceiving of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purpose is not confirmed by the deliberation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, unless the deliberation lead to a promise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> will moves the reason to promise something relating to things subject to his will, and a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> takes its name from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> forasmuch as it proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as first mover.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He that puts his hand to the plough does something already; while he that merely purposes to do something does nothing so far. When, however, he promises, he already sets about doing, although he does not yet fulfil his promise: even so, he that puts his hand to the plough does not plough yet, nevertheless he stretches out his hand for the purpose of ploughing.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a vow should always be about a better good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> need not be always about a better <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. A greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is one that pertains to supererogation. But <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are not only about matters of supererogation, but also about matters of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: thus in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> men <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to renounce the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his pomps, and to keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes on <a href="../bible/psa075.htm#verse12">Psalm 75:12</a>, "Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> vowed (<a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse21">Genesis 28:21</a>) that the Lord should be his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now this above all is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are not only about a better <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Jephte is included among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse32">Hebrews 11:32</a>). Yet he killed his innocent daughter on account of his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> (<a href="../bible/jdg011.htm">Judges 11</a>). Since, then, the slaying of an innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not a better <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but is in itself unlawful, it seems that a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> may be made not only about a better <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but also about something unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things that tend to be harmful to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or that are quite useless, do not come under the head of a better <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Yet sometimes <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are made about immoderate vigils or fasts which tend to injure the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: and sometimes <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are about indifferent matters and such as are useful to no purpose. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not always about a better <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse22">Deuteronomy 23:22</a>): "If thou wilt not promise thou shalt be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now a promise is about something that one does <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> for someone else: since it would be not a promise but a threat to say that one would do something against someone. On like manner it would be futile to promise anyone something unacceptable to him. Wherefore, as every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and since no work is acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> unless it be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, it follows that nothing unlawful or indifferent, but only some act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, should be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. But as a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> denotes a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> promise, while <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> excludes voluntariness, whatever is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, whether to be or not to be, can nowise be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. For it would be foolish to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> that one would die or that one would not fly.

<p>On the other hand, if a thing be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. not absolutely but on the supposition of an end--for instance if <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> be unattainable without it--it may be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> in so far as it is done <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, but not in so far as there is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for doing it. But that which is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, neither absolutely, nor on the supposition of an end, is altogether <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, and therefore is most properly the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. And this is said to be a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in comparison with that which is universally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Therefore, properly speaking, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is said to be about a better <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Renouncing the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> pomps and keeping the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of baptismal <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, in so far as these things are done <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, although they are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The same answer applies to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: although it may also be explained that <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> vowed that he would have the Lord for his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by giving Him a special form of worship to which he was not bound, for instance by offering <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and so forth as mentioned further on in the same passage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Certain things are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whatever be their result; such are acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and these can be, absolutely speaking, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: some are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whatever their result may be; as those things which are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in themselves, and these can nowise be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: while some, considered in themselves, are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and as such may be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, yet they may have an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> result, in which case the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> must not be kept. It was thus with the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of Jephte, who as related in <a href="../bible/jdg011.htm#verse30">Judges 11:30-31</a>, "made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to the Lord, saying: If Thou wilt deliver the children of Ammon into my hands, whosoever shall first come forth out of the doors of my house, and shall meet me when I return in peace . . . the same will I offer a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> to the Lord." For this could have an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> result if, as indeed happened, he were to be met by some animal which it would be unlawful to sacrifice, such as an ass or a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human being</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says [Implicitly 1 Contra Jovin.: Comment. in Micheam vi, viii: Comment. in Jerem. vii. The quotation is from Peter Comestor, Hist. Scholast.]: "In vowing he was foolish, through lack of discretion, and in keeping his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> he was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>." Yet it is premised (<a href="../bible/jdg011.htm#verse29">Judges 11:29</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> came upon him," because his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion, which moved him to make that <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, were from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; and for this reason he is reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as also by reason of the victory which he obtained, and because it is probable that he repented of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, which nevertheless foreshadowed something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The mortification of one's own body, for instance by vigils and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, is not acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> except in so far as it is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and this depends on its being done with due discretion, namely, that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> be curbed without overburdening <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. on this <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> such things may be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> after saying (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans 12:1</a>), "Present your bodies a living sacrifice, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," adds, "your reasonable service." Since, however, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is easily mistaken in judging of matters concerning himself, such <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> as these are more fittingly kept or disregarded according to the judgment of a superior, yet so that, should a man find that without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he is seriously burdened by keeping such a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, and should he be unable to appeal to his superior, he ought not to keep it. As to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> about vain and useless things they should be ridiculed rather than kept.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether all vows are binding?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are not all binding. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs things that are done by another, more than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does, since He has no need for our goods (<a href="../bible/psa015.htm#verse2">Psalm 15:2</a>). Now according to the prescription of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws [Dig. L. xii, de pollicitat., i] a simple promise made to a man is not binding; and this seems to be prescribed on account of the changeableness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will. Much less binding therefore is a simple promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which we call a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one is bound to do what is impossible. Now sometimes that which a man has vowed becomes impossible to him, either because it depends on another's decision, as when, for instance, a man <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to enter a monastery, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of which refuse to receive him: or on account of some defect arising, for instance when a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and afterwards is deflowered; or when a man <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to give a sum of money, and afterwards loses it. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not always binding.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if a man is bound to pay something, he must do so at once. But a man is not bound to pay his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> at once, especially if it be taken under a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> to be fulfilled in the future. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not always binding.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes 5:3-4</a>): "Whatsoever thou hast vowed, pay it; and it is much better not to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, than after a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> not to perform the things promised."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> For one to be accounted faithful one must keep one's promises. Wherefore, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Ep. xxxii, 2: De Mendac. xx] <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> takes its name "from a man's <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> agreeing with his word" ['Fides . . . fiunt dicta' Cicero gives the same etymology (De Offic. i, 7)]. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to be faithful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all, both on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sovereignty, and on account of the favors he has received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> before all to fulfill the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> he has made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since this is part of the fidelity he owes to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On the other hand, the breaking of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a kind of infidelity. Wherefore Solomon gives the reason why <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> should be paid to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because "an unfaithful . . . promise displeaseth Him" [<a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes 5:3</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Honesty demands that a man should keep any promise he makes to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is based on the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. But for a man to be under a civil <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> through a promise he has made, other <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are requisite. And although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> needs not our goods, we are under a very great <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to Him: so that a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> made to Him is most binding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If that which a man has vowed becomes impossible to him through any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whatsoever, he must do what he can, so that he have at least a will ready to do what he can. Hence if a man has vowed to enter a monastery, he must endeavor to the best of his power to be received there. And if his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> was chiefly to bind himself to enter the religious life, so that, in consequence, he chose this particular form of religious life, or this place, as being most agreeable to him, he is bound, should he be unable to be received there, to enter the religious life elsewhere. But if his principal <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is to bind himself to this particular kind of religious life, or to this particular place, because the one or the other pleases him in some special way, he is not bound to enter another religious house, if they are unwilling to receive him into this particular one. on the other hand, if he be rendered incapable of fulfilling his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> through his own fault, he is bound over and above to do penance for his past fault: thus if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has vowed <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and is afterwards violated, she is bound not only to observe what is in her power, namely, perpetual <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>, but also to repent of what she has lost by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by our own will and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse23">Deuteronomy 23:23</a>): "That which is once gone out of thy lips, thou shalt observe, and shalt do as thou hast promised to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, and hast spoken with thy own will and with thy own mouth." Wherefore if in taking a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, it is one's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> and will to bind oneself to fulfil it at once, one is bound to fulfil it immediately.

<p>But if one intend to fulfil it at a certain time, or under a certain <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, one is not bound to immediate fulfilment. And yet one ought not to delay longer than one intended to bind oneself, for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse21">Deuteronomy 23:21</a>): "When thou hast made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> thou shalt not delay to pay it: because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> will require it; and if thou delay, it shall be imputed to thee for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is expedient to take vows?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not expedient to take <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. It is not expedient to anyone to deprive himself of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given him. Now one of the greatest goods that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is liberty whereof he seems to be deprived by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> implicated in a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Therefore it would seem inexpedient for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to take <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one should expose himself to danger. But whoever takes a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> exposes himself to danger, since that which, before taking a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, he could omit without danger, becomes a source of danger to him if he should not fulfil it after taking the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. cxxvii, ad Arment. et Paulin.): "Since thou hast vowed, thou hast bound thyself, thou canst not do otherwise. If thou dost not what thou hast vowed thou wilt not be as thou wouldst have been hadst thou not vowed. For then thou wouldst have been less great, not less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: whereas now if thou breakest <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) thou art the more unhappy, as thou wouldst have been <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a>, hadst thou kept thy <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>." Therefore it is not expedient to take <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 4:16</a>): "Be ye followers of me, as I also am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But we do not read that either <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> or the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> took any <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Therefore it would seem inexpedient to take <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa075.htm#verse12">Psalm 75:12</a>): "Vow ye and pay to the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1 and 2), a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now one makes a promise to a man under one aspect, and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> under another. Because we promise something to a man for his own profit; since it profits him that we should be of service to him, and that we should at first assure him of the future fulfilment of that service: whereas we make promises to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not for His but for our own profit. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. cxxvii, ad Arment. et Paulin.): "He is a kind and not a needy exactor, for he does not grow rich on our payments, but makes those who pay Him grow rich in Him." And just as what we give <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is useful not to Him but to us, since "what is given Him is added to the giver," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. cxxvii, ad Arment. et Paulin.), so also a promise whereby we <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> something to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not conduce to His profit, nor does He need to be assured by us, but it conduces to our profit, in so far as by vowing we fix our wills immovably on that which it is expedient to do. Hence it is expedient to take <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even as one's liberty is not lessened by one being unable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so, too, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> resulting from a will firmly fixed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> does not lessen the liberty, as instanced in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the blessed. Such is the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> implied by a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, bearing a certain resemblance to the confirmation of the blessed. Hence, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. cxxvii, ad Arment. et Paulin.) that "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that compels us to do the better things."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When danger arises from the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> itself, this <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is not expedient, for instance that one cross a river by a tottering bridge: but if the danger arise through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> failure in the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, the latter does not cease to be expedient: thus it is expedient to mount on horseback, though there be the danger of a fall from the horse: else it would behoove one to desist from all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, that may become dangerous <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc011.htm#verse4">Ecclesiastes 11:4</a>): "He that observeth the wind shall not sow, and he that considereth the clouds shall never reap." Now a man incurs danger, not from the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> itself, but from his fault, when he changes his mind by breaking his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Hence, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. cxxvii, ad Arment. et Paulin.): "Repent not of thy <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: thou shouldst rather rejoice that thou canst no longer do what thou mightest lawfully have done to thy detriment."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It was incompetent for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by His very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to take a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, both because He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and because, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> was firmly fixed on the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since He was a "comprehensor." By a kind of similitude, however, He is represented as saying (<a href="../bible/psa021.htm#verse26">Psalm 21:26</a>): "I will pay my <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in the sight of them that fear Him," when He is speaking of His body, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are understood to have vowed things pertaining to the state of perfection when "they left all things and followed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a vow is an act of latria or religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not an act of latria or religion. Every act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Now it would seem to pertain to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to promise a thing and to do it. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> pertains to any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and not to religion especially.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to Tully (De Invent. ii, 53) it belongs to religion to offer <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> worship and ceremonial rites. But he who takes a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> does not yet offer something to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only promises it. Therefore, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not an act of religion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, religious worship should be offered to none but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is made not only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and to one's superiors, to whom <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious vow</a> obedience when they make their profession. Therefore, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not an act of religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa019.htm#verse21">Isaiah 19:21</a>): "(The Egyptians) shall worship Him with <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and offerings and they shall make <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to the Lord, and perform them." Now, the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is properly the act of religion or <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>. Therefore, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is an act of latria or religion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (81, 1, ad 1), every act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> belongs to religion or latria by way of command, in so far as it is directed to the reverence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which is the proper end of <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>. Now the direction of other actions to their end belongs to the commanding <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not to those which are commanded. Therefore the direction of the acts of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the proper act of <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>.

<p>Now, it is evident from what has been said above (1 and 2) that a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that a promise is nothing else than a directing of the thing promised to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom the promise is made. Hence a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a directing of the thing vowed to the worship or service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And thus it is clear that to take a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is properly an act of latria or religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is sometimes the act of another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as, for instance, keeping the fast or observing <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>; while sometimes it is an act of religion, as offering a sacrifice or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>.

<p>But promising either of them to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs to religion, for the reason given above. Hence it is evident that some <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> belong to religion by reason only of the promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, while others belong thereto by reason also of the thing promised, which is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He who promises something gives it already in as far as he binds himself to give it: even as a thing is said to be made when its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is made, because the effect is contained virtually in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. This is why we thank not only a giver, but also one who promises to give.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, whereas a promise may be made to a man also: and this very promise of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is fore made to a man, may be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, and in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act. This is how we are to understand <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> something to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or to one's superiors: so that the promise made to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or to one's superiors is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, in so far as one <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to fulfil what one has promised to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or one's superiors.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it is more praiseworthy and meritorious to do something in fulfilment of a vow, than without a vow?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is more praiseworthy and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to do a thing without a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> than in fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Prosper says (De Vita Contempl. ii): "We should abstain or fast without putting ourselves under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, lest that which we are free to do be done without devotion and unwillingly." Now he who <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to fast puts himself under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. Therefore it would be better for him to fast without taking the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>): "Everyone as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness, or of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loveth a cheerful giver." Now some fulfil sorrowfully what they have vowed: and this seems to be due to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> arising from the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, for <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow according to Metaph. v [Ed. Did. iv, 5]. Therefore, it is better to do something without a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, than in fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the purpose of fixing the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> on that which is vowed, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be more fixed on a thing than when it actually does that thing. Therefore it is no better to do a thing in fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> than without a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the words of <a href="../bible/psa075.htm#verse12">Psalm 75:12</a>, "Vow ye and pay," says: "Vows are counseled to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>." But a counsel is about none but a better <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore it is better to do a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> in fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> than without a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: since he that does it without a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> fulfils only one counsel, viz. the counsel to do it, whereas he that does it with a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, fulfils two counsels, viz. the counsel to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> and the counsel to do it.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> For three reasons it is better and more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to do one and the same <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> with a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> than without. First, because to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>) is an act of religion which is the chief of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now the more excellent the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> the better and more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Wherefore the act of an inferior <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the better the more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> for being commanded by a superior <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whose act it becomes through being commanded by it, just as the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or hope is better if it be commanded by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence the works of the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (for instance, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, which is an act of abstinence; and being continent, which is an act of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>) are better and more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, if they be done in fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, since thus they belong to the divine worship, being like <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virg. viii) that "not even is <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> honorable as such, but only when it is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and cherished by godly <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>."

<p>Secondly, because he that <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> something and does it, subjects himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than he that only does it; for he subjects himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not only as to the act, but also as to the power, since in future he cannot do something else. Even so he gives more who gives the tree with its fruit, than he that gives the fruit only, as Anselm [Eadmer] observes (De Simil. viii). For this reason, we thank even those who promise, as stated above (5, ad 2).

<p>Thirdly, because a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> fixes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> on the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> immovably and to do anything of a will that is fixed on the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> belongs to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 4), just as to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with an obstinate mind aggravates the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and is called a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as stated above (Question 14, Article 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passage quoted should be understood as referring to <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of coercion which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an act to be involuntary and excludes devotion. Hence he says pointedly: "Lest that which we are free to do be done without devotion and unwillingly." On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> resulting from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the immobility of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, wherefore it strengthens the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and increases devotion. Hence the argument does not conclude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of coercion, in so far as it is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow. But the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> resulting from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, in those who are well disposed, in so far as it strengthens the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> not sorrow but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Arment. et Paulin. cxxcii): "Repent not of thy <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: thou shouldst rather rejoice that thou canst no longer do what thou mightest lawfully have done to thy detriment." If, however, the very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, considered in itself, were to become disagreeable and involuntary after one has taken the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to fulfil it remaining withal, it is still more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> than if it were done without the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, since the fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is an act of religion which is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than abstinence, of which <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is an act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who does something without having vowed it has an immovable will as regards the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> which he does and at the time when he does it; but his will does not remain altogether fixed for the time to come, as does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of one who makes a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: for the latter has bound his will to do something, both before he did that particular <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, and perchance to do it many times.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether a vow is solemnized by the reception of holy orders, and by the profession of a certain rule?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not solemnized by the reception of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders and by the profession of a certain rule. As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now external actions pertaining to <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> seem to be directed, not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Therefore they are related to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>: and consequently a solemnization of this kind is not a proper circumstance of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of a thing, would seem to be applicable to all in which that thing is found. Now many things may be the subject of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, which have no connection either with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders, or to any particular rule: as when a man <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> a pilgrimage, or something of the kind. Therefore the solemnization that takes place in the reception of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders or in the profession of a certain rule does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> seems to be the same as a public <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Now many other <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> may be made in public besides that which is pronounced in receiving <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders or in professing a certain rule; which latter, moreover, may be made in private. Therefore not only these <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> These <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> alone are an impediment to the contract of marriage, and annul marriage if it be contracted, which is the effect of a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, as we shall state further on in the Third Part of this work [Supplement, 53, 2].

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The manner in which a thing is solemnized depends on its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> [conditio]: thus when a man takes up arms he solemnizes the fact in one way, namely, with a certain display of horses and arms and a concourse of soldiers, while a marriage is solemnized in another way, namely, the array of the bridegroom and bride and the gathering of their kindred. Now a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore, the solemnization of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> consists in something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; i.e. in some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> which, in accordance with the institution of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, is given when a man makes profession of observing a certain rule, in the second degree after the reception of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Eccl. Hier. vi). The reason of this is that solemnization is not wont to be employed, save when a man gives himself up entirely to some particular thing. For the nuptial solemnization takes place only when the marriage is celebrated, and when the bride and bridegroom mutually deliver the power over their bodies to one another. On like manner a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is solemnized when a man devotes himself to the divine ministry by receiving <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders, or embraces the state of perfection by renouncing the world and his own will by the profession of a certain rule.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This kind of solemnization regards not only men but also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in so far as it is accompanied by a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> or <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author, though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the minister, according to <a href="../bible/num006.htm#verse27">Numbers 6:27</a>, "They shall invoke My name upon the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and I will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> them." Hence a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is more binding with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, and he who breaks a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously. When it is said that a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is no less binding than a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, this refers to the fact that the transgressor of either commits a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not customary to solemnize particular acts, but the embracing of a new state, as we have said above. Hence when a man <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> particular <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, such as a pilgrimage, or some special fast, such a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not competent to be solemnized, but only such as the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> whereby a man entirely devotes himself to the divine ministry or service: and yet many particular works are included under this <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> as under a universal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Through being pronounced in public <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> may have a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, but not a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and divine <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, as the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> have, even when they are pronounced before a few <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Hence the publicity of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> differs from its solemnization.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether those who are subject to another's power are hindered from taking vows?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that those who are subject to another's power are not hindered from taking <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The lesser bond is surpassed by the greater. Now the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> subject to another is a lesser bond than a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> whereby one is under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore those who are subject to another's power are not hindered from taking <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, children are under their parents' power. Yet children may make <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> even without the consent of their parents. Therefore one is not hindered from taking <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, through being subject to another's power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to do is more than to promise. But religious who are under the power of their superiors can do certain things such as to say some psalms, or abstain from certain things. Much more therefore seemingly can they promise such things to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whoever does what he cannot do lawfully <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But subjects do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by taking <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, since nowhere do we find this forbidden. Therefore it would seem that they can lawfully take <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is commanded (<a href="../bible/num030.htm#verse4">Numbers 30:4-6</a>) that "if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> any thing . . . being in her father's house, and yet but a girl in age," she is not bound by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, unless her father consent: and the same is said there (<a href="../bible/num030.htm#verse7">Numbers 30:7-9</a>) of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that has a husband. Therefore in like manner other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that are subject to another's power cannot bind themselves by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can firmly bind himself by a promise to do what is in another's power, but only to that which is entirely in his own power. Now whoever is subject to another, as to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> wherein he is subject to him, it does not lie in his power to do as he will, but it depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the other. And therefore without the consent of his superior he cannot bind himself firmly by a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> in those matters wherein he is subject to another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Nothing but what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> can be the subject of a promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Now it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> for a man to offer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that which belongs to another, as stated above (Question 86, Article 3). Hence the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> are not altogether ensured, when a man who is under another's power <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> that which is in that other's power, except under the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> that he whose power it concerns does not gainsay it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As soon as a man comes of age, if he be a freeman he is in his own power in all matters concerning his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, for instance with regard to binding himself by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion, or with regard to contracting marriage. But he is not in his own power as regards the arrangements of the household, so that in these matters he cannot <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> anything that shall be valid without the consent of his father.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, through being in his master's power, even as regards his personal <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, cannot bind himself by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion, since this would withdraw him from his master's service.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A religious is subject to his superior as to his actions connected with his profession of his rule. Wherefore even though one may be able to do something now and then, when one is not being occupied with other things by one's superior, yet since there is no time when his superior cannot occupy him with something, no <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of a religious stands without the consent of his superior, as neither does the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of a girl while in (her father's) house without his consent; nor of a wife, without the consent of her husband.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of one who is subject to another's power does not stand without the consent of the one to whom he is subject, he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by vowing; because his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is understood to contain the requisite <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, providing, namely, that his superior approve or do not gainsay it.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether children can bind themselves by vow to enter religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that children cannot bind themselves by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion. Since a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> requires deliberation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, it is fitting that those alone should <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> who have the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. But this is lacking in children just as in imbeciles and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a>. Therefore just as imbeciles and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a> cannot bind themselves to anything by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, so neither, seemingly, can children bind themselves by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which can be validly done by one cannot be annulled by another. Now a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion made by a boy or girl before the age of puberty can be revoked by the parents or guardian (20, qu. ii, cap. Puella). Therefore it seems that a boy or girl cannot validly make a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> before the age of fourteen.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the rule of Blessed Benedict [Ch. 58 and a statute of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, a year's probation is granted to those who enter religion, so that probation may precede the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Therefore it seems unlawful, before the year of probation, for children to be bound by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which is not done aright is invalid without being annulled by anyone. But the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> pronounced by a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maiden</a>, even before attaining the age of puberty, is valid, unless it be annulled by her parents within a year (20, qu. ii, cap. Puella). Therefore even before attaining to puberty children can lawfully and validly be bound by a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As may be gathered from what has been said above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>), <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are of two kinds, simple and <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a>. And since, as stated in the same article, the solemnization of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> consists in a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> bestowed through the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it follows that it comes under the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> dispensation. Now a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> takes its efficacy from the deliberation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, whereby one intends to put oneself under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. That such an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> be of no force may happen in two ways. First, through defect of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a> and imbeciles, who cannot bind themselves by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> so long as they remain in a state of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> or imbecility. Secondly, through the maker of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> being subject to another's power, as stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>). Now these two circumstances concur in children before the age of puberty, because in most instances they are lacking in reason, and besides are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> under the care of their parents, or guardians in place of their parents: wherefore in both events their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are without force. It happens, however, through a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition which is not subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws, that the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is accelerated in some, albeit few, who on this account are said to be capable of guile: and yet they are not, for this reason, exempt in any way from the care of their parents; for this care is subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which takes into account that which is of most frequent occurrence.

<p>Accordingly we must say that boys or girls who have not reached the years of puberty and have not attained the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> can nowise bind themselves to anything by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. If, however, they attain the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, before reaching the years of puberty, they can for their own part, bind themselves by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>; but their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> can be annulled by their parents, under whose care they are still subject.

<p>Yet no matter how much they be capable of guile before the years of puberty, they cannot be bound by a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious vow</a>, on account of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> decree [Sext. Decret. cap. Is qui, de Reg. et transeunt. ad Relig.] which considers the majority of cases. But after the years of puberty have been reached, they can bind themselves by religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, simple or <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a>, without the consent of their parents.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument avails in the case of children who have not yet reached the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: for their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> then are invalid, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> subject to another's power contain an implied <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, namely, that they be not annulled by the superior. This <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> renders them licit and valid if it be fulfilled, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument avails in the case of <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> which are taken in profession.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether vows admit of dispensation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are not subject to dispensation. It is less to have a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> commuted than to be dispensed from keeping it. But a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> cannot be commuted, according to <a href="../bible/lev027.htm#verse9">Leviticus 27:9-10</a>, "A beast that may be sacrificed to the Lord, if anyone shall <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, shall be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and cannot be changed, neither a better for a worse, nor a worse for a better." Much less, therefore, do <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> admit of dispensation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> in matters concerning the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> and in the Divine precepts, especially those of the First Table, since these aim directly at the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the last end of the precepts. Now the fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a matter of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, and is commanded by the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, as shown above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), and belongs to the precepts of the First Table since it is an act of religion. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> do not admit of dispensation.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is based on the fidelity which a man owes to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can dispense in such a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as this. Neither, therefore, can any one grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which proceeds from the common will of many has apparently greater stability than that which proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> will of some one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which derives its force from the common will admits of dispensation by a man. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> also admit of dispensation by a man.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The dispensation from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is to be taken in the same sense as a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> given in the observance of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> because, as stated above (I-II, 96, 6; I-II, 97, 4), a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is made with an eye to that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the majority of instances. But since, in certain cases this is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, there is need for someone to decide that in that particular case the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not to be observed. This is properly speaking to dispense in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: for a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> would seem to denote a commensurate distribution or application of some common thing to those that are contained under it, in the same way as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to dispense food to a household.

<p>In like manner a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who takes a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> makes a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for himself as it were, and binds himself to do something which in itself and in the majority of cases is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But it may happen that in some particular case this is simply <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or useless, or a hindrance to a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and this is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> contrary to that which is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, as is clear from what has been said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in such a case, to decide that the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not to be observed. And if it be decided absolutely that a particular <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not to be observed, this is called a "dispensation" from that <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>; but if some other <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> be imposed in lieu of that which was to have been observed, the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is said to be "commuted." Hence it is less to commute a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> than to dispense from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: both, however, are in the power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> An animal that could be lawfully sacrificed was deemed <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> from the very moment that it was the subject of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, being, as it were, dedicated to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and for this reason it could not be changed: even so neither may one now exchange for something better, or worse, that which one has vowed, if it be already <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, e.g. a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> or a house. On the other hand, an animal that could not be sacrificed, through not being the lawful <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a sacrifice, could and had to be bought back, as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> requires. Even so, <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> can be commuted now, if no <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> has intervened.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound by <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> and Divine precept to fulfil his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, so, too, is he bound under the same heads to obey the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> or commands of his superiors. And yet when he is dispensed from keeping a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, this does not involve disobedience to that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, for this would be contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> and the Divine command; but it amounts to this--that what was <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in this particular case. Even so, when a superior grants a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, that which was contained under a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is by his authority no longer so contained, in so far as he decides that in this case such and such a thing is not fitting <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Consequently when an ecclesiastical superior dispenses someone from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, he does not dispense him from keeping a precept of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, but he pronounces a decision on a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to which a man had bound himself of his own accord, and of which he was unable to consider every circumstance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fidelity we owe to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not require that we fulfil that which it would be wrong or useless to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, or which would be an obstacle to the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> whereunto the dispensation from that <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> would conduce. Hence the dispensation from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not contrary to the fidelity due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether it is possible to be dispensed from a solemn vow of continency?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is possible to be dispensed from a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>. As stated above, one reason for granting a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is if it be an obstacle to a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>, even though it be <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a>, may be an obstacle to a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is more God-like than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Now one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> may be an obstacle to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole community, for instance, in the case where, if certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have vowed <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> were to marry, the peace of their country might be procured. Therefore it seems that it is possible to be dispensed even from a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, religion is a more excellent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Now if a man <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> an act of religion, e.g. to offer sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he can be dispensed from that <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Much more, therefore, can he be dispensed from the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> which is about an act of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the observance of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of abstinence may be a source of danger to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so too may be the observance of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>. Now one who takes a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of abstinence can be dispensed from that <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> if it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> a source of danger to his body. Therefore for the same reason one may be dispensed from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> is part of the <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is solemnized, so also are the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> and obedience. But it is possible to be dispensed from the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> and obedience, as in the case of those who are appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> after making profession. Therefore it seems that it is possible to be dispensed from a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir026.htm#verse20">Sirach 26:20</a>): "No price is worthy of a continent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p>Further, (Extra, De Statu Monach.) at the end of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a>, Cum ad Monasterium it is stated that the "renouncing of property, like the keeping of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, is so bound up with the monastic rule, that not even the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> can disperse from its observance."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Three things may be considered in a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>: first, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>; secondly, the perpetuity of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, namely, when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> binds himself by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to the perpetual observance of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>: thirdly, the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Accordingly, some [<a href="../cathen/15631d.htm">William of Auxerre</a>, Sum. Aur. III. vii. 1, qu. 5 say that the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> cannot be a matter of dispensation, on account of the <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> itself for which no worthy price can be found, as is stated by the authority quoted above. The reason for this is assigned by some to the fact that by <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> overcomes a foe within himself, or to the fact that by <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfectly conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in respect of purity of both body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But this reason does not seem to be cogent since the goods of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, far surpass the goods of the body and still more conform us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet one may be dispensed from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Therefore, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> itself absolutely considered seems no reason why the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> thereof cannot be a matter of dispensation; especially seeing that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse34">1 Corinthians 7:34</a>) exhorts us to be continent on account of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, when he says that the unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> . . . "thinketh on the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the Lord']," and since the end is of more account than the means.

<p>Consequently others [<a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>, Sent. iv, D, 38 find the reason for this in the perpetuity and universality of this <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. For they assert that the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> cannot be canceled, save by something altogether contrary thereto, which is never lawful in any <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. But this is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because just as the practice of carnal intercourse is contrary to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>, so is eating flesh or drinking wine contrary to abstinence from such things, and yet these latter <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> may be a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for dispensation.

<p>For this reason others [<a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, on the above <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a>] maintain that one may be dispensed even from a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>, for the sake of some common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or common need, as in the case of the example given above (Objection 1), of a country being restored to peace through a certain marriage to be contracted. Yet since the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> quoted says explicitly that "not even the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> can dispense a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> from keeping <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>," it follows seemingly, that we must maintain that, as stated above (10, ad 1; cf. <a href="../bible/lev027.htm#verse9">Leviticus 27:9-28</a>), whatsoever has once been sanctified to the Lord cannot be put to any other use. For no ecclesiastical prelate can make that which is sanctified to lose its <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, not even though it be something inanimate, for instance a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> to be not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, so long as it remains entire. Much less, therefore, can a prelate make a man that is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cease to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, so long as he lives. Now the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> consists in a kind of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> or <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who takes the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). Hence no prelate of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can make a man, who has pronounced a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, to be quit of that to which he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, e.g. one who is a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> no more, although a prelate may, for some particular reason, inhibit him from exercising his order. On like manner the Pope cannot make a man who has made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> cease to be a religious, although certain jurists have ignorantly held the contrary.

<p>We must therefore consider whether <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> bound up with the purpose for which the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is solemnized. because if not, the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> can remain without the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>, but not if <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> bound up with that for which the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is solemnized. Now the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of observing <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> is connected with <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>, not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> but by the institution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; wherefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> solemnized by the reception of Holy Orders. on the other hand the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of observing; <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the religious state, whereby a man renounces the world and binds himself wholly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service, for this is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, in which state a man is under the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of taking to himself a wife, of begetting children, of looking after his household, and of procuring whatever is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for these purposes. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse33">1 Corinthians 7:33</a>) that "he that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please his wife; and he is divided." Hence the "<a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>" takes his name from "unity" [The Greek <em>monos</em>] in contrast with this division. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot dispense from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> solemnized by the <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>; and the reason assigned by the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> is because "<a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is bound up with the monastic rule."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Perils occasioned by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs should be obviated by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> means, not by turning divine things to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> use. Now a professed religious is dead to the world and lives to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so he must not be called back to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life on the pretext of any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> contingency.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of temporal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> can be a matter of dispensation, as also a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of temporal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or of temporal abstinence.

<p>But the fact that no dispensation can be granted from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> solemnized by profession is due, not to its being an act of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, but because through the <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> it is already an act of religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Food is directly ordered to the upkeep of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, therefore abstinence from food may be a direct source of danger to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: and so on this count a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of abstinence is a matter of dispensation. On the other hand sexual intercourse is directly ordered to the upkeep not of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> but of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, wherefore to abstain from such intercourse by <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> does not endanger the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. And if indeed <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> a source of danger to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, this danger may be obviated by some other means, for instance by abstinence, or other corporal remedies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A religious who is made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> than from his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>, since he must have nothing of his own and must hold himself as being the dispenser of the common goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On like manner neither is he dispensed from his <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a>; it is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> that he is not bound to obey if he have no superior; just as the abbot of a monastery, who nevertheless is not dispensed from his <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a>.

<p>The passage of Ecclesiasticus, which is put forward in the contrary sense, should be taken as meaning that neither fruitfulness of the of the flesh nor any bodily <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be compared with <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>, which is reckoned one of the goods of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Sanct. Virg. viii). Wherefore it is said pointedly "of a continent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," not "of a continent body."

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether the authority of a prelate is required for commutation or the dispensation of a vow?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the authority of a prelate is not required for the commutation or dispensation of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may enter religion without the authority of a superior prelate. Now by entering religion one is <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> he made in the world, even from the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of making a pilgrimage to the Holy Land [Cap. Scripturae, de Voto et Voti redempt.]. Therefore the commutation or dispensation of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is possible without the authority of a superior prelate.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to dispense anyone from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> seems to consist in deciding in what circumstances he need not keep that <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. But if the prelate is at fault in his decision, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who took the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> does not seem to be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, since no prelate can grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> contrary to the divine precept about keeping one's <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, as stated above (10, ad 2; 11). Likewise, when anyone rightly determines of his own authority that in his case a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not to be kept, he would seem not to be bound; since a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> need not be kept if it have an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> result (2, ad 2). Therefore the Authority of a prelate is not required that one may be dispensed from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if it belongs to a prelate's power to grant dispensations from <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, on the same count it is competent to all <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, but it does not belong to all to dispense from every <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Therefore it does not belong to the power of a prelate to dispense from <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> binds one to do something, even as a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does. Now the superior's authority is requisite for a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from a precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (I-II, 96, 6; I-II, 97, 4). Therefore it is likewise required in a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1 and 2), a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> about something acceptable to Him. Now if you promise something to anyone it depends on his decision whether he accept what you promise. Again in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a prelate stands in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> place. Therefore a commutation or dispensation of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> requires the authority of a prelate who in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> stead declares what is acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 2:10</a>: "For . . . have pardoned . . . for your sakes . . . in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." And he says significantly "for your sakes," since whenever we ask a prelate for a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> we should do so to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in Whose <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he dispenses, or to promote the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is His Body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All other <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are about some particular works, whereas by the religious life a man consecrates his whole life to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service. Now the particular is included in the universal, wherefore a <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> [Cap. Scripturae, de Voto et Voti redempt.] says that "a man is not deemed a vow-breaker if he exchange a temporal service for the perpetual service of religion." And yet a man who enters religion is not bound to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, whether of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> or of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> or the like, which he made when in the world, because by entering religion he dies to his former life, and it is unsuitable to the religious life that each one should have his own observances, and because the burden of religion is onerous enough without requiring the addition of other burdens.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Some have held that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> can dispense from <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> at their will, for the reason that every <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> supposes as a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> that the superior prelate be willing; thus it was stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of a subject, e.g. of a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> or a son, supposes this <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, if "the father or master consent," or "does not dissent." And thus a subject might break his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> without any remorse of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, whenever his superior tells him to.

<p>But this opinion is based on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> supposition: because a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> prelate being, not a master, but a dispenser, his power is given "unto edification, not for destruction" (<a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse8">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>), and consequently, just as he cannot command that which is in itself displeasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so neither can he forbid what is in itself pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore absolutely speaking <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> them. But it does belong to a prelate to decide what is the more <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and the more acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently in matters presenting no difficulty, the prelate's dispensation would not excuse one from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for instance, if a prelate were to dispense a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter the religious life, without any apparent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to prevent him from fulfilling his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. But if some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> were to appear, giving rise, at least, to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, he could hold to the prelate's decision whether of commutation or of dispensation. He could not, however, follow his own judgment in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, because he does not stand in the place of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; except perhaps in the case when the thing he has vowed is clearly unlawful, and he is unable to have recourse to the prelate.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> holds the place of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> throughout the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he exercises absolute power of dispensing from all <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> that admit of dispensation. To other and inferior <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> is the power committed of dispensing from those <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> that are commonly made and frequently require dispensation, in order that men may easily have recourse to someone; such are the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of pilgrimage (Cap. de Peregin., de Voto et Voti redempt.), <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and the like, and of pilgrimage to the Holy Land, are reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> [Cap. Ex multa].
