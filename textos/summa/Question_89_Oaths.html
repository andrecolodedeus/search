<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether to swear is to call God to witness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that to swear is not to call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness. Whoever invokes the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> calls <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness, since it is His word that <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> contains. Therefore, if to swear is to call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness, whoever invoked the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> would swear.

<p>But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Therefore the antecedent is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one does not pay anything to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by calling him to witness. But he who swears by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pays something to Him for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse33">Matthew 5:33</a>): "Thou shall pay [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'perform'] thy oaths to the Lord"; and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says [Serm. clxxx] that to swear [jurare] is "to pay the right [jus reddere] of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore to swear is not to call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the duties of a judge differ from the duties of a witness, as shown above (Q67,70). Now sometimes a man, by swearing, implores the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse5">Psalm 7:5</a>, "If I have rendered to them that repaid me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, let me deservedly fall empty before my enemies." Therefore to swear is not to call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on perjury (Serm. clxxx): "When a man says: 'By <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,' what else does he mean but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is his witness?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse16">Hebrews 6:16</a>), oaths are taken for the purpose of confirmation. Now speculative propositions receive confirmation from reason, which proceeds from principles <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> and infallibly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But particular contingent facts regarding <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be confirmed by a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> reason, wherefore propositions regarding such things are wont to be confirmed by <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> witness does not suffice to confirm such matters for two reasons. First, on account of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> lack of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for many give way to lying, according to <a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse10">Psalm 16:10</a>, "Their mouth hath spoken lies [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'proudly']." Secondly, on account of this lack of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, since he can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> neither the future, nor secret thoughts, nor distant things: and yet men speak about such things, and our everyday life requires that we should have some <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> about them. Hence the need to have recourse to a Divine witness, for neither can <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> lie, nor is anything hidden from Him. Now to call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness is named "jurare" [to swear] because it is established as though it were a principle of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> [jure] that what a man asserts under the invocation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as His witness should be accepted as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Now sometimes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called to witness when we assert present or past events, and this is termed a "declaratory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>"; while sometimes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called to witness in confirmation of something future, and this is termed a "promissory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>."

<p>But oaths are not employed in order to substantiate <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> matters, and such as come under the investigation of reason; for it would seem absurd in a scientific discussion to wish to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> one's point by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is one thing to employ a Divine witness already given, as when one adduces the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>; and another to implore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to bear witness, as in an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to pay his oaths to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> because he performs what he swears to do, or because, from the very fact that he calls upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness, he recognizes Him as possessing universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and unerring <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is called to give witness, in order that he may make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about what is alleged. Now there are two ways in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> whether the alleged facts are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or not. On one way He reveals the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> simply, either by inward inspiration, or by unveiling the facts, namely, by making public what was hitherto secret: in another way by punishing the lying witness, and then He is at once judge and witness, since by punishing the liar He makes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his lie. Hence oaths are of two kinds: one is a simple contestation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as when a man says "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is my witness," or, "I speak before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," or, "By <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," which has the same meaning, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states [See argument On the contrary]; the other is by cursing, and consists in a man binding himself or something of his to punishment if what is alleged be not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is lawful to swear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not lawful to swear. Nothing forbidden in the Divine Law is lawful. Now swearing is forbidden (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse34">Matthew 5:34</a>), "But I say to you not to swear at all"; and (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse12">James 5:12</a>), "Above all things, my brethren, swear not." Therefore swearing is unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever comes from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> seems to be unlawful, because according to <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse18">Matthew 7:18</a>, "neither can an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tree bring forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fruit." Now swearing comes from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse37">Matthew 5:37</a>): "But let your speech be: Yea, yea: No, no. And that which is over and above these is of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Therefore swearing is apparently unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to seek a sign of Divine Providence is to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is altogether unlawful, according to <a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy 6:16</a>, "Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>." Now he that swears seems to seek a sign of Divine Providence, since he asks <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to bear witness, and this must be by some evident effect. Therefore it seems that swearing is altogether unlawful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>): "Thou shalt fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> . . . and shalt swear by His name."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nothing prevents a thing being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, and yet becoming a source of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to one who makes use thereof unbecomingly: thus to receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and yet he that receives it "unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself" (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse29">1 Corinthians 11:29</a>). Accordingly in answer to the question in point it must be stated that an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is in itself lawful and commendable. This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from its origin and from its end. From its origin, because swearing owes its introduction to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> possesses unerring <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and foresight of all things: and from its end, since oaths are employed in order to justify men, and to put an end to controversy (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse16">Hebrews 6:16</a>).

<p>Yet an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> becomes a source of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to him that makes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use of it, that is who employs it without <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> and due caution. For if a man calls <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as witness, for some trifling reason, it would seemingly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> him to have but little reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since he would not treat even a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in this manner. Moreover, he is in danger of committing perjury, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> easily offends in words, according to <a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse2">James 3:2</a>, "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> offend not in word, the same is a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/sir023.htm#verse9">Sirach 23:9</a>): "Let not thy mouth be accustomed to swearing, for in it there are many falls."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse34">Matthew 5:34</a>, says: "Observe that our Saviour forbade us to swear, not by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth. For it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> have this most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom of swearing by the elements." Yet this answer does not suffice, because James adds, "nor by any other <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>." Wherefore we must reply that, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Mendacio xv), "when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> employs an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in his epistles, he shows how we are to understand the saying, 'I say to you, not to swear at all'; lest, to wit, swearing lead us to swear easily and from swearing easily, we contract the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and, from swearing <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>, we fall into perjury. Hence we find that he swore only when writing, because thought brings caution and avoids hasty words."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i. 17): "If you have to swear, note that the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> arises from the infirmity of those whom you convince, which infirmity is indeed an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Accordingly He did not say: 'That which is over and above is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,' but 'is of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.' For you do no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; since you make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of swearing, by persuading another to a useful purpose: yet it 'comes of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>' of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by whose infirmity you are forced to swear."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who swears tempts not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because it is not without usefulness and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that he implores the Divine assistance. Moreover, he does not expose himself to danger, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be unwilling to bear witness there and then: for He certainly will bear witness at some future time, when He "will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of hearts" (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>). And this witness will be lacking to none who swears, neither for nor against him.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether three accompanying conditions of an oath are suitably assigned, namely, justice, judgment, and truth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, judgment and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are unsuitably assigned as the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> accompanying an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Things should not be enumerated as diverse, if one of them includes the other. Now of these three, one includes another, since <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 53): and judgment is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (Question 60, Article 1). Therefore the three accompanying <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> are unsuitably assigned.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, many other things are required for an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, namely, devotion, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things and cannot lie. Therefore the accompanying <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> are insufficiently enumerated.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, these three are requisite in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>: since he ought to do nothing contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or without judgment, according to <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse21">1 Timothy 5:21</a>, "Do nothing without prejudice," i.e. without previous judgment [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by declining to either side.']. Therefore these three should not be associated with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> any more than with other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jer004.htm#verse2">Jeremiah 4:2</a>): "Thou shalt swear: As the Lord liveth, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and in judgment, and in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>": which words <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> expounds, saying: "Observe that an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> must be accompanied by these <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> except for one who makes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of it. Now two <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are required for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. First, that one swear, not for frivolous, but for urgent reasons, and with discretion; and this requires judgment or discretion on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who swears. Secondly, as regards the point to be confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, that it be neither <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, nor unlawful, and this requires both <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so that one employ an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in order to confirm what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, so that one confirm what is lawful. A rash <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> lacks judgment, a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> lacks <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> or unlawful <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> lacks <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Judgment does not signify here the execution of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but the judgment of discretion, as stated above. Nor is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> here to be taken for the part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but for a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of speech.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Devotion, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and like <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> requisite for the right manner of swearing are implied by judgment: for the other two regard the things sworn to as stated above. We might also reply that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> regards the reason for swearing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is great danger in swearing, both on account of the greatness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is called upon to bear witness, and on account of the frailty of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> tongue, the words of which are confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Hence these <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are more requisite for an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> than for other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether an oath is an act of religion or latria?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is not an act of religion, or <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>. Acts of religion are about <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and divine things. But oaths are employed in connection with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> disputes, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse16">Hebrews 6:16</a>). Therefore swearing is not an act of religion or <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to religion to give worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 53). But he who swears offers nothing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but calls <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be his witness. Therefore swearing is not an act of religion or <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the end of religion or latria is to show reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the end of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is not this, but rather the confirmation of some assertion. Therefore swearing is not an act of religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>): "Thou shalt fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, and shalt serve Him only, and thou shalt swear by His name." Now he speaks there of the servitude of religion. Therefore swearing is an act of religion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As appears from what has been said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), he that swears calls <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness in confirmation of what he says. Now nothing is confirmed save by what is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> and more powerful. Therefore in the very fact that a man swears by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he acknowledges <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be more powerful, by reason of His unfailing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and His universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and thus in a way he shows reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse16">Hebrews 6:16</a>) that "men swear by one greater than themselves," and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse34">Matthew 5:34</a>, says that "he who swears either reveres or loves the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by whom he swears." The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, too, states (Metaph. i, 3) that "to swear is to give very great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>." Now to show reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs to religion or <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>. wherefore it is evident that an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is an act of religion or <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Two things may be observed in an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. The witness adduced, and this is Divine: and the thing witnessed to, or that which makes it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to call the witness, and this is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. Accordingly an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> belongs to religion by reason of the former, and not of the latter.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the very fact that a man takes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as witness by way of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, he acknowledges Him to be greater: and this pertains to the reverence and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that he offers something to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, reverence and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Whatsoever we do, we should do it in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore there is no hindrance, if by intending to assure a man, we show reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For we ought so to perform our actions in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> that they may conduce to our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also works for His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and for our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether oaths are desirable and to be used frequently as something useful and good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that oaths are desirable and to be used frequently as something useful and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Just as a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is an act of religion, so is an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Now it is commendable and more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to do a thing by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, because a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is an act of religion, as stated above (Question 88, Article 5). Therefore for the same reason, to do or say a thing with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is more commendable, and consequently oaths are desirable as being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse34">Matthew 5:34</a>, says that "he who swears either reveres or loves the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by whom he swears." Now reverence and love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are desirable as something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. Therefore swearing is also.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, swearing is directed to the purpose of confirming or assuring. But it is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing for a man to confirm his assertion. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is desirable as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir023.htm#verse12">Sirach 23:12</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that sweareth much shall be filled with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>": and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Mendacio xv) that "the Lord forbade swearing, in order that for your own part you might not be fond of it, and take pleasure in seeking occasions of swearing, as though it were a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whatever is required merely as a remedy for an infirmity or a defect, is not reckoned among those things that are desirable for their own sake, but among those that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>: this is clear in the case of medicine which is required as a remedy for sickness. Now an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is required as a remedy to a defect, namely, some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> lack of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is not to be reckoned among those things that are desirable for their own sake, but among those that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for this life; and such things are used unduly whenever they are used outside the bounds of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. For this reason <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 17): "He who understands that swearing is not to be held as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing," i.e. desirable for its own sake, "restrains himself as far as he can from uttering oaths, unless there be urgent need."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is no parity between a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> and an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: because by a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> we direct something to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that for this very reason a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is an act of religion. On the other hand, in an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> reverence for the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is taken in confirmation of a promise. Hence what is confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> does not, for this reason, become an act of religion, since moral acts take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He who swears does indeed make use of his reverence or love for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by whom he swears: he does not, however, direct his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to the reverence or love of that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but to something else that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the present life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even as a medicine is useful for healing, and yet, the stronger it is, the greater harm it does if it be taken unduly, so too an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is useful indeed as a means of confirmation, yet the greater the reverence it demands the more dangerous it is, unless it be employed aright; for, as it is written (<a href="../bible/sir023.htm#verse13">Sirach 23:13</a>), "if he make it void," i.e. if he deceive his brother, "his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall be upon him: and if he dissemble it," by swearing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, and with dissimulation, "he offendeth double," [because, to wit, "pretended equity is a twofold <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Enarr. in Psalm 63:7] declares: "and if he swear in vain," i.e. without due <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, "he shall not be justified."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it is lawful to swear by creatures?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not lawful to swear by creatures. It is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse34">Matthew 5:34-36</a>): "I say to you not to swear at all, neither by <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> . . . nor by the earth . . . nor by Jerusalem . . . nor by thy head": and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, expounding these words, says: "Observe that the Saviour does not forbid swearing by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth," etc.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, punishment is not due save for a fault. Now a punishment is appointed for one who swears by creatures: for it is written (22, qu. i, can. Clericum): "If a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> swears by creatures he must be very severely rebuked: and if he shall persist in this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> we wish that he be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>." Therefore it is unlawful to swear by creatures.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is an act of religion, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>).

<p>But religious worship is not due to any creature, according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse23">Romans 1:23-25</a>. Therefore it is not lawful to swear by a creature.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> swore "by the health of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>" (<a href="../bible/gen042.htm#verse16">Genesis 42:16</a>). Moreover it is customary to swear by the Gospel, by relics, and by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 3), there are two kinds of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. One is uttered a simple contestation or calling <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as witness: and this kind of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, like <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is based on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> and chiefly about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and secondarily about creatures in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is reflected, as stated above (Question 1, Article 1). On like manner an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is chiefly referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whose testimony is invoked; and secondarily an appeal by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is made to certain creatures considered, not in themselves, but as reflecting the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Thus we swear by the Gospel, i.e. by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whose <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the Gospel; and by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and kept it.

<p>The other way of swearing is by cursing and in this kind of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> a creature is adduced that the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be wrought therein. Thus a man is wont to swear by his head, or by his son, or by some other thing that he loves, even as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> swore (<a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse23">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>), saying: "I call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness upon my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p>As to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph's</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> by the health of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> this may be understood in both ways: either by way of a curse, as though he pledged Pharao's health to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or by way of contestation, as though he appealed to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which the princes of the earth are appointed to execute.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> forbade us to swear by creatures so as to give them the reverence due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> adds that "the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, through swearing by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the like, worshipped creatures with a Divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>."

<p>In the same sense a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> is punished, according to the canons (22, qu. i, can. Clericum, Objection 2), for swearing by a creature, for this savors of the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of unbelief. Hence in the next chapter, it is said: "If any one swears by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> hair or head, or otherwise utter <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he be in ecclesiastical orders, let him be degraded."

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Religious worship is shown to one whose testimony is invoked by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: hence the prohibition (<a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse13">Exodus 23:13</a>): "By the name of strange gods you shall not swear." But religious worship is not given to creatures employed in an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in the ways mentioned above.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether an oath has a binding force?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> has no binding force. An <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is employed in order to confirm the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of an assertion. But when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> makes an assertion about the future his assertion is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, though it may not be verified. Thus <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> lied not (<a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse15">2 Corinthians 1:15, seqq.</a>) though he went not to Corinth, as he had said he would (<a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>). Therefore it seems that an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is not binding.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> (Categ. viii, 22). Now an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). But it would sometimes be contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or an obstacle thereto, if one were to fulfil what one has sworn to do: for instance, if one were to swear to commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or to desist from some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> action. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is not always binding.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, sometimes a man is compelled against his will to promise something under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Now, "such a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is loosed by the Roman Pontiffs from the bond of his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>" (Extra, De Jurejur., cap. Verum in ea quaest., etc.). Therefore an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is not always binding.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can be under two opposite <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. Yet sometimes the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who swears and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom he swears have opposite intentions. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> cannot always be binding.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse33">Matthew 5:33</a>): "Thou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> implies something to be done or omitted; so that apparently it regards neither the declaratory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> (which is about something present or past), nor such oaths as are about something to be effected by some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> (as, for example, if one were to swear that it would rain tomorrow), but only such as are about things to be done by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who swears.

<p>Now just as a declaratory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, which is about the future or the present, should contain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so too ought the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which is about something to be done by us in the future. Yet there is a difference: since, in the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that is about the past or present, this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> affects, not the thing that already has been or is, but the action of the swearer, in the point of his swearing to what is or was already <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; whereas, on the contrary, in the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that is made about something to be done by us, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> falls on the thing guaranteed by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. For a man is bound to make <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> what he has sworn, else his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> lacks <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p>Now if this thing be such as not to be in his power, his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is lacking in judgment of discretion: unless perchance what was possible when he swore become impossible to him through some mishap. as when a man swore to pay a sum of money, which is subsequently taken from him by force or <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>. For then he would seem to be excused from fulfilling his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, although he is bound to do what he can, as, in fact, we have already stated with regard to the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> (88, 3, ad 2). If, on the other hand, it be something that he can do, but ought not to, either because it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or because it is a hindrance to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, then his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is lacking in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: wherefore an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> must not be kept when it involves a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or a hindrance to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For in either case "its result is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>" [Cf. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, Homil. xix, in Decoll. S. Joan. Bapt.]

<p>Accordingly we must conclude that whoever swears to do something is bound to do what he can for the fulfilment of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; provided always that the other two accompanying <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> be present, namely, judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not the same with a simple assertion, and with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> wherein <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called to witness: because it suffices for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of an assertion, that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> say what he proposes to do, since it is already <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, namely, the purpose of the doer. But an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> should not be employed, save in a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> about which one is firmly certain: and, consequently, if a man employ an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, he is bound, as far as he can, to make <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> what he has sworn, through reverence of the Divine witness invoked, unless it leads to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> result, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> may lead to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> result in two ways. First, because from the very outset it has an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> result, either through being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (as, if a man were to swear to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>), or through being a hindrance to a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as if a man were to swear not to enter religion, or not to become a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, or that he would not accept a prelacy, supposing it would be expedient for him to accept, or in similar cases. For oaths of this kind are unlawful from the outset: yet with a difference: because if a man swear to commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in swearing, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in keeping his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: whereas if a man swear not to perform a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which he is not bound to do withal, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> indeed in swearing (through placing an obstacle to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is the inspirer of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purposes), yet he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in keeping his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, though he does much better if he does not keep it.

<p>Secondly, an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> leads to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> result through some new and unforeseen emergency. An instance is the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of Herod, who swore to the damsel, who danced before him, that he would give her what she would ask of him. For this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> could be lawful from the outset, supposing it to have the requisite <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, namely, that the damsel asked what it was right to grant. but the fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was unlawful. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Officiis i, 50): "Sometimes it is wrong to fulfil a promise, and to keep an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; as Herod, who granted the slaying of John, rather than refuse what he had promised."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is a twofold <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which a man takes under compulsion: one, whereby he is beholden to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom he promises something; and this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is cancelled by the compulsion, because he that used force deserves that the promise made to him should not be kept. The other is an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> whereby a man is beholden to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in virtue of which he is bound to fulfil what he has promised in His name. This <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is not removed in the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, because that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought rather to suffer temporal loss, than violate his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. He can, however, seek in a court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to recover what he has paid, or denounce the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to his superior even if he has sworn to the contrary, because such an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> would lead to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> results since it would be contrary to public <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The Roman Pontiffs, in absolving men from oaths of this kind, did not pronounce such oaths to be unbinding, but relaxed the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> for some just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the swearer is not the same as the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom he swears, if this be due to the swearer's guile, he must keep his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in accordance with the sound understanding of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is made. Hence <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Summo Bono ii, 31): "However artful a man may be in wording his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> accepts his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> as understood by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom it is made." And that this refers to the deceitful <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is clear from what follows: "He is doubly guilty who both takes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> name in vain, and tricks his neighbor by guile." If, however, the swearer uses no guile, he is bound in accordance with his own intention. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxvi, 7): "The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ear takes such like words in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> outward sense, but the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a> interprets them according to our inward <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>."

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether an oath is more binding than a vow?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is more binding than a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. A <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a simple promise: whereas an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> includes, besides a promise, an appeal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as witness. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is more binding than a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the weaker is wont to be confirmed by the stronger. Now a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is sometimes confirmed by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is stronger than a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> arises from the deliberation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, a stated above (Question 88, Article 1); while the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> results from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whose testimony is invoked. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is something greater than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> deliberation, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is greater than that of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> binds one to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> while an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> sometimes binds one to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now one is more bound to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is more binding than an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> both of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> and of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> arises from something Divine; but in different ways. For the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> arises from the fidelity we owe <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which binds us to fulfil our promises to Him. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> arises from the reverence we owe Him which binds us to make <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> what we promise in His name. Now every act of infidelity includes an irreverence, but not conversely, because the infidelity of a subject to his lord would seem to be the greatest irreverence. Hence a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is more binding than an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not any kind of promise, but a promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and to be unfaithful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is most grievous.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is added to a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> not because it is more stable, but because greater stability results from "two immutable things" [<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse18">Hebrews 6:18</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Deliberation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> gives a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> its stability, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who takes the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: but it has a greater <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of stability on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is offered.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether anyone can dispense from an oath?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no one can dispense from an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Just as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is required for a declaratory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, which is about the past or the present, so too is it required for a promissory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, which is about the future. Now no one can dispense a man from swearing to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about present or past things. Therefore neither can anyone dispense a man from making <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that which he has promised by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to do in the future.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a promissory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is used for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom the promise is made. But, apparently, he cannot release the other from his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, since it would be contrary to the reverence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Much less therefore can a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> be granted by anyone.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, except certain <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> reserved to the Pope alone, as stated above (88, 12, ad 3). Therefore in like manner, if an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> admits of dispensation, any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can dispense from an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. And yet seemingly this is to be against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> [Caus. XV, qu. 6, can. Auctoritatem, seqq.: Cap. Si vero, de Jurejurando]. Therefore it would seem that an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> does not admit of dispensation.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is more binding than an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, as stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>). But a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> admits of dispensation and therefore an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> does also.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 88, Article 10), the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> both from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> arises from the fact that something which is useful and morally <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself and considered in general, may be morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and hurtful in respect of some particular emergency: and such a case comes under neither <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> nor <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Now anything morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or hurtful is incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: for if it be morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> it is opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and if it be hurtful it is contrary to judgment. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> likewise admits of dispensation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A dispensation from an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> does not imply a permission to do anything against the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: for this is impossible, since the keeping of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> comes under a Divine precept, which does not admit of dispensation: but it implies that what hitherto came under an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> no longer comes under it, as not being due <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, just as we have said with regard to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> (88, 10, ad 2). Now the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a declaratory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, which is about something past or present, has already acquired a certain <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, and has become unchangeable, wherefore the dispensation will regard not the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> but the act itself of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: so that such a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> would be directly contrary to the Divine precept. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a promissory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is something future, which admits of change, so that, to wit, in certain emergencies, it may be unlawful or hurtful, and consequently undue <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Therefore a promissory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> admits of dispensation, since such dispensation regards the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and is not contrary to the Divine precept about the keeping of oaths.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> One <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may promise something under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to another in two ways. First, when he promises something for his benefit: for instance, if he promise to serve him, or to give him money: and from such a promise he can be released by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom he made it: for he is understood to have already kept his promise to him when he acts towards him according to his will. Secondly, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> promises another something pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or to the benefit of others: for instance, if a man promise another under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that he will enter religion, or perform some act of kindness. On this case the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom the promise is made cannot release him that made the promise, because it was made principally not to him but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: unless perchance it included some <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, for instance, "provided he give his consent" or some such like <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sometimes that which is made the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a promissory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is manifestly opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, either because it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as when a man swears to commit a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, or because it is an obstacle to a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as when a man swears not to enter a religion: and such an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> requires no dispensation. But in the former case a man is bound not to keep such an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, while in the latter it is lawful for him to keep or not to keep the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, as stated above (07, ad 2). Sometimes what is promised on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is doubtfully right or wrong, useful or harmful, either in itself or under the circumstance. On this case any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can dispense. Sometimes, however, that which is promised under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is manifestly lawful and beneficial. An <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of this kind seemingly admits not of dispensation but of commutation, when there occurs something better to be done for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in which case the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> would seem to belong chiefly to the power of the Pope, who has charge over the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and even of absolute relaxation, for this too belongs in general to the Pope in all matters regarding the administration of things ecclesiastical. Thus it is competent to any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to cancel an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> made by one of his subjects in matters that come under his authority: for instance, a father may annul his daughter's <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and a husband his wife's (<a href="../bible/num030.htm#verse6">Numbers 30:6, seqq.</a>), as stated above with regard to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> (88, A8,9).

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether an oath is voided by a condition of person or time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is not voided by a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or time. An <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse16">Hebrews 6:16</a>), is employed for the purpose of confirmation. Now it is competent to anyone to confirm his assertion, and at any time. Therefore it would seem that an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is not voided by a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or time.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to swear by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more than to swear by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xliv in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] says: "If there is a reason for swearing, it seems a small thing to swear by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but a great thing to swear by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. To those who think thus, it must be said: Nonsense! the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> were made for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the sake of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of all <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> and at all times are wont to swear by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Much more, therefore, is it lawful to swear by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same effect does not proceed from contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, since contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> produce contrary effects. Now some are debarred from swearing on account of some personal defect; children, for instance, before the age of fourteen, and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have already committed perjury. Therefore it would seem that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> ought not to be debarred from swearing either on account of his dignity, as <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, or on account of the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the time.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in this world no living <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is equal in dignity to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew 11:11</a>) that "he that is the lesser in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is greater than he," namely than <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, while yet living. Now an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is competent to swear, for it is written (<a href="../bible/rev010.htm#verse6">Apocalypse 10:6</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> "swore by Him that liveth for ever and ever." Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to be excused from swearing, on account of his dignity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated (II, qu. v, can. Si quis presbyter): "Let a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> be examined 'by his sacred <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>,' instead of being put on his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>": and (22, qu. v, can. Nullus): "Let no one in ecclesiastical orders dare to swear on the Holy <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things are to be considered in an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. One is on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose testimony is invoked, and in this respect we should hold an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in the greatest reverence. For this reason children before the age of puberty are debarred from taking oaths [Caus. XXII, qu. 5, can. Parvuli], and are not called upon to swear, because they have not yet attained the perfect use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, so as to be able to take a <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> with due reverence. Perjurers also are debarred from taking an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, because it is presumed from their antecedents that they will not treat an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> with the reverence due to it. For this same reason, in order that oaths might be treated with due reverence the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> says (22, qu. v, can. Honestum): "It is becoming that he who ventures to swear on <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things should do so <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, with all propriety and fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>The other thing to be considered is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whose assertion is confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. For a man's assertion needs no confirmation save because there is a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about it. Now it derogates from a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> dignity that one should <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of what he says, wherefore "it becomes not <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of great dignity to swear." For this reason the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> says (II, qu. v, can. Si quis presbyter) that "<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should not swear for trifling reasons." Nevertheless it is lawful for them to swear if there be need for it, or if great <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may result therefrom. Especially is this the case in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> affairs, when moreover it is becoming that they should take <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> on days of <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, since they ought then to devote themselves to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters. Nor should they on such occasions take oaths temporal matters, except perhaps in cases grave <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some are unable to confirm their own assertions on account of their own defect: and some there are whose words should be so certain that they need no confirmation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The greater the thing sworn by, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holier</a> and the more binding is the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, considered in itself, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Ad Public., Ep. xlvii): and accordingly is a graver <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to swear by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. Yet the contrary may be the case on account of the manner of swearing for instance, an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> might be taken with deliberation and <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, and an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> frivolously and without deliberation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing prevents the same thing from arising out of contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, by way of superabundance and defect. It is in this way that some are debarred from swearing, through being of so great authority that it is unbecoming for them to swear; while others are of such little authority that their oaths have no standing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is adduced not on account of any defect in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, as though one ought not to credit his mere word, but in order to show that the statement made issues from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> disposition. Thus too <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is sometimes spoken of by <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> as swearing, in order to express the immutability of His word, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse17">Hebrews 6:17</a>).
