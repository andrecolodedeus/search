<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the separated soul can understand anything?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body can understand nothing at all. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima i, 4) that "the understanding is corrupted together with its interior principle." But by death all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> interior principles are corrupted. Therefore also the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself is corrupted.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is hindered from understanding when the senses are tied, and by a distracted <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, as explained above (84, 7,8). But death destroys the senses and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, as we have shown above (Question 77, Article 8). Therefore after death the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands nothing.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can understand, this must be by means of some <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But it does not understand by means of innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, because it has none such; being at first "like a tablet on which nothing is written": nor does it understand by <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> abstracted from things, for it does not then possess organs of sense and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the abstraction of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: nor does it understand by means of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, formerly abstracted and retained in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for if that were so, a child's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would have no means of understanding at all: nor does it understand by means of intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> divinely infused, for such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> would not be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, such as we treat of now, but the effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> apart from the body understands nothing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima i, 1), "If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had no proper operation, it could not be separated from the body." But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is separated from the body; therefore it has a proper operation and above all, that which consists in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can understand when it is apart from the body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The difficulty in solving this question arises from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united to the body can understand only by turning to the phantasms, as experience shows. Did this not proceed from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> through its being bound up with the body, as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> said, the difficulty would vanish; for in that case when the body was once removed, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would at once return to its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and would understand intelligible things simply, without turning to the phantasms, as is exemplified in the case of other separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. In that case, however, the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body would not be for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for evidently it would understand worse in the body than out of it; but for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the body, which would be unreasonable, since <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> on account of the form, and not the form for the sake of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But if we admit that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> requires it to understand by turning to the phantasms, it will seem, since death does not change its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that it can then <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> understand nothing; as the phantasms are wanting to which it may turn.

<p>To solve this difficulty we must consider that as nothing acts except so far as it is actual, the mode of action in every agent follows from its mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has one mode of being when in the body, and another when apart from it, its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> remaining always the same; but this does not mean that its union with the body is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> thing, for, on the contrary, such union belongs to its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a light object is not changed, when it is in its proper place, which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to it, and outside its proper place, which is beside its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, therefore, when united to the body, consistently with that mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, has a mode of understanding, by turning to corporeal phantasms, which are in corporeal organs; but when it is separated from the body, it has a mode of understanding, by turning to simply intelligible objects, as is proper to other separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Hence it is as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to understand by turning to the phantasms as it is for it to be joined to the body; but to be separated from the body is not in accordance with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and likewise to understand without turning to the phantasms is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to it; and hence it is united to the body in order that it may have an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and an operation suitable to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But here again a difficulty arises. For since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is always ordered to what is best, and since it is better to understand by turning to simply intelligible objects than by turning to the phantasms; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should have ordered the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> so that the nobler way of understanding would have been <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to it, and it would not have needed the body for that purpose.

<p>In order to resolve this difficulty we must consider that while it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that it is nobler in itself to understand by turning to something higher than to understand by turning to phantasms, nevertheless such a mode of understanding was not so perfect as regards what was possible to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This will appear if we consider that every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> possesses <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power by the influence of the Divine light, which is one and simple in its first principle, and the farther off <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> creatures are from the first principle so much the more is the light divided and diversified, as is the case with lines radiating from the centre of a circle. Hence it is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by His one Essence understands all things; while the superior <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> understand by means of a number of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which nevertheless are fewer and more universal and bestow a deeper comprehension of things, because of the efficaciousness of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power of such <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>: whereas the inferior <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> natures possess a greater number of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which are less universal, and bestow a lower degree of comprehension, in proportion as they recede from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power of the higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. If, therefore, the inferior <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> received <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the same degree of universality as the superior <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, since they are not so strong in understanding, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which they would derive through them would be imperfect, and of a general and confused <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. We can see this to a certain extent in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for those who are of weaker <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> fail to acquire perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through the universal conceptions of those who have a better understanding, unless things are explained to them singly and in detail. Now it is clear that in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> hold the lowest place among <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. But the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> required various grades of being. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had willed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to understand in the same way as separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, it would follow that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so far from being perfect, would be confused and general. Therefore to make it possible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to possess perfect and proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, they were so made that their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> required them to be joined to bodies, and thus to receive the proper and adequate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of sensible things from the sensible things themselves; thus we see in the case of uneducated men that they have to be taught by sensible examples.

<p>It is clear then that it was for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that it was united to a body, and that it understands by turning to the phantasms. Nevertheless it is possible for it to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> apart from the body, and also to understand in another way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher's</a> words carefully examined will show that he said this on the previous supposition that understanding is a movement of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as united, just as sensation is, for he had not as yet explained the difference between <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and sense. We may also say that he is referring to the way of understanding by turning to phantasms. This is also the meaning of the second objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not understand by way of innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, nor by <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> abstracted then, nor only by <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> retained, and this the objection proves; but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in that state understands by means of participated <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> arising from the influence of the Divine light, shared by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as by other separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; though in a lesser degree. Hence as soon as it ceases to act by turning to corporeal (phantasms), the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> turns at once to the superior things; nor is this way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> unnatural, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of the influx of both of the light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and of the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the separated soul understands separate substances?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not understand separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more perfect when joined to the body than when <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> apart from it, being an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and every part of a whole is more perfect when it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in that whole. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the body does not understand separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> as shown above (Question 88, Article 1). Therefore much less is it able to do so when apart from the body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> either by its presence or by its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by their presence, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can enter into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; nor by means of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> abstracted by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, for an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is more simple than a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot at all understand separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> said that the ultimate <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. If, therefore, the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can understand separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, its <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> would be secured by its separation alone; which cannot be reasonably be said.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Souls apart from the body <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> other separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; as we see in the case of the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, who saw <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse23">Luke 16:23</a>). Therefore separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> see the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ix, 3), "our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> acquires the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of incorporeal things by itself"--i.e. by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> itself (88, 1, ad 1). Therefore from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has of itself, we can judge how it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> other separate things. Now it was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), that as long as it is united to the body the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands by turning to phantasms, and therefore it does not understand itself save through becoming actually <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> abstracted from phantasms; for thus it understands itself through its own act, as shown above (Question 87, Article 1). When, however, it is separated from the body, it understands no longer by turning to phantasms, but by turning to simply intelligible objects; hence in that state it understands itself through itself. Now, every separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> "understands what is above itself and what is below itself, according to the mode of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>" (De Causis viii): for a thing is understood according as it is in the one who understands; while one thing is in another according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that in which it is. And the mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is inferior to that of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but is the same as that of other separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> apart from the body has perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of other separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but it has an imperfect and defective <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> so far as its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is concerned. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is otherwise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is, indeed, less perfect considering its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in which it communicates with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body: but it has a greater freedom of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, since the weight and care of the body is a clog upon the clearness of its <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> in the present life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by means of divinely impressed <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; which, however, fail to give perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them, forasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is inferior to that of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> ultimate <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists not in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of any separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; but in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is seen only by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the separated soul knows all natural things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things. For the types of all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Therefore, as separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, they also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever understands the greater intelligible, will be able much more to understand the lesser intelligible. But the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, which are in the highest degree of intelligibility. Therefore much more can it understand all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things which are in a lower degree of intelligibility.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> have greater <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; yet they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, but have to learn many things by long experience, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Summo Bono i). Therefore neither can the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, understands by means of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, received from the influence of the Divine light. Nevertheless, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is inferior to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, to whom this kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> apart from the body through such <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> does not receive perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but only a general and confused kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, therefore, have the same relation through such <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to imperfect and confused <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have to the perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> thereof. Now <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> through such <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things perfectly; because all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has produced in the respective natures of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things has been produced by Him in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8). Hence it follows that separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things not with a certain and proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but in a general and confused manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not understand all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things through his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but through certain <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (Question 87, Article 1). So it does not follow that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things because it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> after a fashion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body does not perfectly understand separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, so neither does it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things perfectly; but it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them confusedly, as above explained in this article.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> speaks of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future which neither <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, nor separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> except so far as future things pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> or are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. But we are here treating of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> acquired here by study is proper and perfect; the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which we speak is confused. Hence it does not follow that to study in order to learn is useless.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the separated soul knows singulars?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars. For no cognitive power besides the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> remains in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as is clear from what has been said above (Question 77, Article 8). But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars, as we have shown (86, 1). Therefore the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the singular is more determinate than <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the universal. But the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has no determinate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, therefore much less can it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the singulars, yet not by sense, for the same reason it would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all singulars. But it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all singulars. Therefore it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> none.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> said: "I have five brethren" (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse28">Luke 16:28</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> some singulars, but not all, not even all present singulars. To understand this, we must consider that there is a twofold way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> things, one by means of abstraction from phantasms, and in this way singulars cannot be directly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but only indirectly, as stated above (Question 86, Article 1). The other way of understanding is by the infusion of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in that way it is possible for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars. For as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, universal and singular, by His Essence, as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of universal and <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> principles (14, 2), so likewise separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars by <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which are a kind of participated similitude of the Divine Essence. There is a difference, however, between <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the fact that through these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have a perfect and proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things; whereas separated have only a confused <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, by reason of their perfect <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, through these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not only the specific natures of things, but also the singulars contained in those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; whereas separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only those singulars to which they are determined by former <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in this life, or by some affection, or by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude, or by the disposition of the Divine order; because whatever is received into anything is conditioned according to the mode of the recipient.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the singular by way of <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>; neither does the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it thus; but as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is confined to those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has some kind of determinate relation, as we have said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has not the same relation to all singulars, but one relation to some, and another to others. Therefore there is not the same reason why it should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all singulars.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the habit of knowledge here acquired remains in the separated soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> acquired in this life does not remain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body: for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> shall be destroyed" (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, some in this world who are less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> enjoy <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> denied to others who are better. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> remained in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after death, it would follow that some who are less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> would, even in the future life, excel some who are better; which seems unreasonable.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will possess <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by influence of the Divine light. Supposing, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> here acquired remained in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it would follow that two forms of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> would co-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the same subject which cannot be.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Praedic. vi, 4,5), that "a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> hard to remove: yet sometimes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is destroyed by sickness or the like." But in this life there is no change so thorough as death. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is destroyed by death.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. liii, ad Paulinum), "Let us learn on earth that kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which will remain with us in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some say that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> resides not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself, but in the sensitive powers, namely, the imaginative, cogitative, and memorative, and that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are not kept in the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. If this were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it would follow that when the body is destroyed by death, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> here acquired would also be entirely destroyed.

<p>But, since <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> resides in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is "the abode of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 4), the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> here acquired must be partly in the aforesaid sensitive powers and partly in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. This can be seen by considering the very actions from which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> arises. For "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are like the actions whereby they are acquired" (Ethic. ii, 1). Now the actions of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is here acquired, are performed by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> turning to the phantasms in the aforesaid sensitive powers. Hence through such acts the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> acquires a certain facility in considering the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> received: and the aforesaid sensitive powers acquire a certain aptitude in seconding the action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> when it turns to them to consider the intelligible object. But as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> act resides chiefly and formally in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself, whilst it resides materially and dispositively in the inferior powers, the same distinction is to be applied to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a>, therefore, acquired in the present life does not remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as regards what belongs to the sensitive powers; but as regards what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself, it must remain; because, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Long. et Brev. Vitae ii), a form may be corrupted in two ways; first, directly, when corrupted by its contrary, as heat, by cold; and secondly, indirectly, when its subject is corrupted. Now it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not corrupted through corruption of the subject, for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is an incorruptible faculty, as above stated (79, 2, ad 2). Neither can the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> be corrupted by their contrary; for there is no contrary to intelligible "intentions," above all as regards simple <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> of "what a thing is." But contrariety may <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as regards <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> composition and division, or also reasoning; so far as what is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in statement or argument is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And thus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> may be corrupted by its contrary when a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> argument seduces anyone from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> in the above work mentions two ways in which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is corrupted directly: namely, "forgetfulness" on the part of the memorative power, and "deception" on the part of a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> argument. But these have no place in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore we must conclude that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so far as it is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, remains in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is not speaking of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but as to the act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>; and hence he says, in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the assertion quoted, "Now, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As a less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may exceed a better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in bodily stature, so the same kind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may have a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the future life which a better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may not have. Such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, however, cannot be compared with the other prerogatives enjoyed by the better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These two kinds of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are not of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, so there is no impossibility.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This objection considers the corruption of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> on the part of the sensitive powers.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the act of knowledge acquired here remains in the separated soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> here acquired does not remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima i, 4), that when the body is corrupted, "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> neither remembers nor loves." But to consider what is previously <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is an act of <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. Therefore the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot retain an act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> here acquired.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cannot have greater power in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than they have in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united to the body. But in this life we cannot understand by intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> without turning to phantasms, as shown above (Question 84, Article 7). Therefore the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot do so, and thus it cannot understand at all by intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> acquired in this life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 1), that "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> produce acts similar to those whereby they are acquired." But the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is acquired here by acts of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> turning to phantasms: therefore it cannot produce any other acts. These acts, however, are not adapted to the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the state of separation cannot produce any act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> acquired in this life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It was said to Dives in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse25">Luke 16:25</a>): "Remember thou didst receive <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in thy lifetime."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Action offers two things for our consideration--its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and its mode. Its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> comes from the object, whereto the faculty of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is directed by the (intelligible) <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which is the object's similitude; whereas the mode is gathered from the power of the agent. Thus that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> see a stone is due to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the stone in his eye; but that he see it clearly, is due to the eye's visual power. Therefore as the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), and since the state of the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not the same as it is in this life, it follows that through the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> acquired in this life the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> apart from the body can understand what it understood formerly, but in a different way; not by turning to phantasms, but by a mode suited to a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> apart from the body. Thus the act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> here acquired remains in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but in a different way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks of remembrance, according as <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> belongs to the sensitive part, but not as belonging in a way to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as explained above (Question 79, Article 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The different mode of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is produced by the different state of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; not by diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The acts which produce a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> are like the acts <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but not in mode. For example, to do just things, but not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, that is, pleasurably, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of political <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereby we act pleasurably. (Cf. Aristotle, Ethic. v, 8: Magn. Moral. i, 34).

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether local distance impedes the knowledge in the separated soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that local distance impedes the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Cura pro Mort. xiii), that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead are where they cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is done here." But they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is done among themselves. Therefore local distance impedes the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Divin. Daemon. iii), that "the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon's</a> rapidity of movement enables them to tell things unknown to us." But agility of movement would be useless in that respect unless their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was impeded by local distance; which, therefore, is a much greater hindrance to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is inferior to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon's</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as there is distance of place, so is there distance of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. But distance of time impedes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the future. Therefore it seems that distance of place also impedes its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse23">Luke 16:23</a>), that Dives, "lifting up his eyes when he was in torment, saw <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> afar off." Therefore local distance does not impede <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have held that the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the singular by abstraction from the sensible. If that were so, it might be that local distance would impede its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for either the sensible would need to act upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> upon the sensible, and in either case a determinate distance would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. This is, however, impossible because abstraction of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the sensible is done through the senses and other sensible faculties which do not remain actually in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> apart from the body. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when separated understands singulars by <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> derived from the Divine light, which is indifferent to what is near or distant. Hence <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not hindered by local distance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed cannot see what is done here, not because they are 'there,' as if impeded by local distance; but for some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as we shall explain (8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks there in accordance with the opinion that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have bodies <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> united to them, and so have sensitive powers, which require local distance. In the same book he expressly sets down this opinion, though apparently rather by way of narration than of assertion, as we may gather from De Civ. Dei xxi, 10.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The future, which is distant in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, does not actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, and therefore is not knowable in itself, because so far as a thing falls short of being, so far does it fall short of being knowable. But what is locally distant <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> actually, and is knowable in itself. Hence we cannot argue from distance of time to distance of place.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether separated souls know that takes place on earth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what takes place on earth; for otherwise they would have no care for it, as they have, according to what Dives said (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse27">Luke 16:27-28</a>), "I have five brethren . . . he may testify unto them, lest they also come into the place of torments." Therefore separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what passes on earth.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the dead often appear to the living, asleep or awake, and tell them of what takes place there; as Samuel appeared to Saul (<a href="../bible/1sa028.htm#verse11">1 Samuel 28:11</a>). But this could not be unless they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what takes place here. Therefore they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what takes place on earth.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what happens among themselves. If, therefore, they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what takes place among us, it must be by reason of local distance; which has been shown to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> (7).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse21">Job 14:21</a>): "He will not understand whether his children come to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or dishonor."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, of which we are treating now, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what passes on earth. This follows from what has been laid down (4), since the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of singulars, by being in a way determined to them, either by some vestige of previous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or affection, or by the Divine order. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> departed are in a state of separation from the living, both by Divine order and by their mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, whilst they are joined to the world of incorporeal <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; and hence they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what goes on among us. Whereof <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> gives the reason thus: "The dead do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how the living act, for the life of the spirit is far from the life of the flesh; and so, as corporeal things differ from incorporeal in genus, so they are distinct in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>" (Moral. xii). <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> seems to say the same (De Cura pro Mort. xiii), when he asserts that, "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead have no concern in the affairs of the living."

<p><a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, however, seem to be divided in opinion as regards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> continues the passage above quoted: "The case of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is different, for since they see the light of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>, we cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that external things are unknown to them." But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Cura pro Mort. xiii) expressly says: "The dead, even the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is done by the living or by their own children," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> quotes on the text, "<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> hath not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> us" (<a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse16">Isaiah 63:16</a>). He confirms this opinion by saying that he was not visited, nor consoled in sorrow by his mother, as when she was alive; and he could not think it possible that she was less kind when in a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> state; and again by the fact that the Lord promised to king Josias that he should die, lest he should see his people's afflictions (<a href="../bible/2ki022.htm#verse20">2 Kings 22:20</a>). Yet <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says this in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; and premises, "Let every one take, as he pleases, what I say." <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, on the other hand, is positive, since he says, "We cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>." His opinion, indeed, seems to be the more probable one--that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all that passes here. For they are equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, of whom <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what happens among those living on earth. But as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed are most perfectly united to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, they do not suffer from sorrow, nor do they interfere in mundane affairs, except in accordance with Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed may care for the living, even if <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of their state; just as we care for the dead by pouring forth <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> on their behalf, though we are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of their state. Moreover, the affairs of the living can be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them not immediately, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> who pass hence thither, or by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or even by "the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the same book.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That the dead appear to the living in any way whatever is either by the special dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; in order that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead may interfere in affairs of the living--and this is to be accounted as <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>. Or else such apparitions occur through the instrumentality of bad or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the departed; as may likewise happen when the living appear, without their own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, to others living, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the same book. And so it may be said of Samuel that he appeared through Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>; according to <a href="../bible/sir046.htm#verse23">Sirach 46:23</a>, "he slept, and told the king the end of his life." Or, again, this apparition was procured by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; unless, indeed, the authority of <a href="../bible/sir000.htm">Ecclesiasticus</a> be set aside through not being received by the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> as canonical <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This kind of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not proceed from the obstacle of local distance, but from the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> mentioned above.
