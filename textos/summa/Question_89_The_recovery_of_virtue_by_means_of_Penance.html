<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the virtues are restored through Penance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not restored through penance. Because lost <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be restored by penance, unless penance be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But, since penance is itself a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and all the more, since some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precede penance, viz., <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 85, Article 6). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not restored through penance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Penance consists in certain acts of the penitent. But the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> through any act of ours: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 18: In Ps. 118) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forms the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in us without us." Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not restored through Penance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, he that has <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> performs works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with ease and pleasure: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 8) that "a man is not just if he does not rejoice in just <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>." Now many penitents find difficulty in performing <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not restored through Penance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We read (<a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse22">Luke 15:22</a>) that the father commanded his penitent son to be clothed in "the first robe," which, according to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (Expos. in Luc. vii), is the "mantle of wisdom," from which all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> flow together, according to <a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse7">Wisdom 8:7</a>: "She teacheth <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in life." Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are restored through Penance.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sins</a> are pardoned through Penance, as stated above (86, 1). But there can be no remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> except through the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Wherefore it follows that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is infused into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through Penance. Now all the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> flow from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, even as all the powers result from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; as stated in I-II, 110, 4, ad 1. Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are restored through Penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Penance restores the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the same way as it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as stated above (Question 86, Article 1). Now it is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because, in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it is rather an effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Consequently it does not follow that penance, as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, needs to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of penance together with the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> through the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> stand as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, while the formal power of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> effectively indeed, but instrumentally; and the first act of the penitent, viz., <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, stands as ultimate disposition to the reception of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, while the subsequent acts of Penance proceed from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are already there.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 86, Article 5), sometimes after the first act of Penance, which is <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, certain remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> remain, viz. dispositions <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by previous acts, the result being that the penitent finds difficulty in doing <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Nevertheless, so far as the inclination itself of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is concerned, the penitent performs works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with pleasure and ease. even as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> find it hard to do an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, on account of sleepiness or some indisposition of the body.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether, after Penance, man rises again to equal virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that, after Penance, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rises again to equal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans 8:28</a>): "To them that love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all things work together unto <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," whereupon a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that "this is so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, if any such <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> goes astray and wanders from the path, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes even this conduce to his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But this would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> if he rose again to lesser <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it seems that a penitent never rises again to lesser <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says [Cf. Hypognosticon iii, an anonymous work <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>] that "Penance is a very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing, for it restores every defect to a state of perfection." But this would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> unless <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were recovered in equal measure. Therefore equal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is always recovered through Penance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse5">Genesis 1:5</a>: "There was evening and morning, one day," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "The evening light is that from which we fall the morning light is that to which we rise again." Now the morning light is greater than the evening light. Therefore a man rises to greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> than that which he had before; which is confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> words (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans 5:20</a>): "Where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> did more abound."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> whether proficient or perfect is greater than incipient <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But sometimes a man falls from proficient <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and rises again to incipient <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> always rises again to less <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (86, 6, ad 3; 89, 1, ad 2), the movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, in the justification of the ungodly, is the ultimate disposition to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; so that in the same instant there is infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> together with the aforesaid movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, as stated in I-II, 113, 5,7, which movement includes an act of penance, as stated above (Question 86, Article 2). But it is evident that forms which admit of being more or less, become intense or remiss, according to the different dispositions of the subject, as stated in I-II, 52, 1,2; I-II, 66, 1]. Hence it is that, in Penance, according to the degree of intensity or remissness in the movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, the penitent receives greater or lesser <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now the intensity of the penitent's movement may be proportionate sometimes to a greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than that from which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> fell by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, sometimes to an equal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, sometimes to a lesser. Wherefore the penitent sometimes arises to a greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than that which he had before, sometimes to an equal, sometimes to a lesser <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: and the same applies to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which flow from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The very fact of falling away from the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, does not work unto the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of all those who love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is evident in the case of those who fall and never rise again, or who rise and fall yet again; but only to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of "such as according to His purpose are called to be <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>," viz. the predestined, who, however often they may fall, yet rise again finally. Consequently <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> comes of their falling, not that they always rise again to greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but that they rise to more abiding <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not indeed on the part of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself, because the greater the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the more abiding it is, but on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who, the more careful and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> he is, abides the more steadfastly in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence the same <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds that "their fall conduces to their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because they rise more <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and more enlightened."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Penance, considered in itself, has the power to bring all defects back to perfection, and even to advance <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to a higher state; but this is sometimes hindered on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whose movement towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and in detestation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is too remiss, just as in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> adults receive a greater or a lesser <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to the various ways in which they prepare themselves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This comparison of the two <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> to the evening and morning light is made on account of a likeness of order, since the darkness of night follows after the evening light, and the light of day after the light of morning, but not on account of a likeness of greater or lesser <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Again, this saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> refers to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which abounds more than any number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Nor is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of all, that the more their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> abound, the more abundant <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> they receive, if we measure <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> is, however, more abundant, as regards the very notion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, because to him who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more a more "gratuitous" favor is vouchsafed by his pardon; although sometimes those whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> abound, abound also in sorrow, so that they receive a more abundant <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as was the case with <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalen</a>.

<p>To the argument advanced in the contrary sense it must be replied that in one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> proficient <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is greater than incipient <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but this is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> the case in different men, for one begins with a greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than another has in the state of proficiency: thus <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. ii, 1): "Let all, both now and hereafter, acknowledge how perfectly the boy Benedict turned to the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from the very beginning."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether, by Penance, man is restored to his former dignity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not restored by Penance to his former dignity: because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/amo005.htm#verse2">Amos 5:2</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is cast down," observes: "It is not said that she cannot rise up, but that the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall not rise; because the sheep that has once strayed, although the shepherd bring it back on his shoulder, has not the same <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as if it had never strayed." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not, through Penance, recover his former dignity.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says: "Whoever fail to preserve the dignity of the sacred order, must be content with saving their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; for it is a difficult thing to return to their former degree." Again, <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a> says (Ep. vi ad Agapit.) that "the canons framed at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">council of Nicaea</a> exclude penitents from even the lowest orders of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not, through Penance, recover his former dignity.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> a man can advance to a higher sacred order. But this is not permitted to a penitent after his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/eze044.htm#verse10">Ezekiel 44:10-13</a>): "The Levites that went away . . . from Me . . . shall never [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'not'] come near to Me, to do the office of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>": and as laid down in the Decretals (Dist. 1, ch. 52), and taken from the council of Lerida: "If those who serve at the Holy Altar fall suddenly into some deplorable weakness of the flesh, and by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy do proper penance, let them return to their duties, yet so as not to receive further promotion." Therefore Penance does not restore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his former dignity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As we read in the same Distinction, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> writing to Secundinus (Regist. vii) says: "We consider that when a man has made proper satisfaction, he may return to his honorable position": and moreover we read in the acts of the council of Agde: "Contumacious <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, so far as their position allows, should be corrected by their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. so that when Penance has reformed them, they may recover their degree and dignity."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loses a twofold dignity, one in respect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other in respect of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In respect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he again loses a twofold dignity. one is his principal dignity, whereby he was counted among the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this he recovers by Penance, which is signified (<a href="../bible/luk015.htm">Luke 15</a>) in the prodigal son, for when he repented, his father commanded that the first garment should be restored to him, together with a <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">ring</a> and shoes. The other is his secondary dignity, viz. innocence, of which, as we read in the same chapter, the elder son boasted saying (<a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse29">Luke 15:29</a>): "Behold, for so many years do I serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandments": and this dignity the penitent cannot recover. Nevertheless he recovers something greater sometimes; because as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. de centum Ovibus, 34 in Evang.), "those who acknowledge themselves to have strayed away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, make up for their past losses, by subsequent gains: so that there is more <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> on their account, even as in battle, the commanding officer thinks more of the soldier who, after running away, returns and bravely attacks the foe, than of one who has never turned his back, but has done nothing brave."

<p>By <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loses his ecclesiastical dignity, because thereby he becomes unworthy of those things which appertain to the exercise of the ecclesiastical dignity. This he is debarred from recovering: first, because he fails to repent; wherefore <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> wrote to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Masso, and as we read in the Distinction quoted above (Objection 3): "The canons order those to be restored to their former degree, who by repentance have made satisfaction for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or have made worthy confession of them. On the other hand, those who do not mend their corrupt and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ways are neither allowed to exercise their order, nor received to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of communion."

<p>Secondly, because he does penance negligently, wherefore it is written in the same Distinction (Objection 3): "We can be sure that those who show no signs of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> compunction, or of earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, who avoid <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> or study, would exercise their former duties with great negligence if they were restored to them."

<p>Thirdly, if he has committed a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to which an <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> is attached; wherefore it is said in the same Distinction (Objection 3), quoting the council of Pope Martin [Martin, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>]: "If a man marry a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> or the relict of another, he must not be admitted to the ranks of the clergy: and if he has succeeded in creeping in, he must be turned out. In like manner, if anyone after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> be guilty of homicide, whether by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, or by command, or by counsel, or in self-defense." But this is in consequence not of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>.

<p>Fourthly, on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, wherefore it is said in the same Distinction (Objection 3): "Those who have been publicly convicted or caught in the act of perjury, robbery, fornication, and of such like crimes, according to the prescription of the sacred canons must be deprived of the exercise of their respective orders, because it is a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should be placed over them. But those who commit such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> occultly and confess them secretly to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, may be retained in the exercise of their respective orders, with the assurance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> merciful forgiveness, provided they be careful to expiate their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by fasts and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, vigils and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>." The same is expressed (Extra, De Qual. Ordinand.): "If the aforesaid crimes are not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by a judicial process, or in some other way made <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a>, those who are guilty of them must not be hindered, after they have done penance, from exercising the orders they have received, or from receiving further orders, except in cases of homicide."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The same is to be said of the recovery of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> as of the recovery of innocence which belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> secondary dignity in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In these words <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> does not say that it is impossible, but that it is difficult, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to recover his former dignity after having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, because this is allowed to none but those who repent perfectly, as stated above. To those canonical statutes, which seem to forbid this, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> replies in his letter to Boniface (Ep. clxxxv): "If the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> forbids anyone, after doing penance for a crime, to become a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, or to return to his clerical duties, or to retain them the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> was not to deprive him of the hope of pardon, but to preserve the rigor of discipline; else we should have to deny the keys given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of which it was said: 'Whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.'" And further on he adds: "For <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David did penance for his deadly crimes, and yet he retained his dignity; and Blessed Peter by shedding most bitter tears did indeed repent him of having denied his Lord, and yet he remained an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>. Nevertheless we must not deem the care of later teachers excessive, who without endangering a man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, exacted more from his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, having, in my opinion, found by experience, that some assumed a pretended repentance through hankering after honors and power."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This statute is to be understood as applying to those who do public penance, for these cannot be promoted to a higher order. For Peter, after his denial, was made shepherd of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sheep, as appears from <a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse21">John 21:21</a>, where <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> comments as follows: "After his denial and repentance Peter gives <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of greater confidence in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: for whereas, at the supper, he durst not ask Him, but deputed John to ask in his stead, afterwards he was placed at the head of his brethren, and not only did not depute another to ask for him, what concerned him, but henceforth asks the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a> instead of John."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether virtuous deeds done in charity can be deadened?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be deadened. For that which is not cannot be changed. But to be deadened is to be changed from life to death. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, after being done, are no more, it seems that they cannot afterwards be deadened.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. But to take away the reward from one who has <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> it is an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, which cannot be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it is not possible for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to be deadened by a subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the strong is not corrupted by the weak. Now works of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are stronger than any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because, as it is written (<a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse12">Proverbs 10:12</a>), "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> covereth all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be deadened by a subsequent mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse24">Ezekiel 18:24</a>): "If the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turn himself away from his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> . . . all his justices which he hath done shall not be remembered."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A living thing, by dying, ceases to have vital operations: for which reason, by a kind of metaphor, a thing is said to be deadened when it is hindered from producing its proper effect or operation.

<p>Now the effect of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> works, which are done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is to bring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>; and this is hindered by a subsequent mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, inasmuch as it takes away <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are said to be deadened by a subsequent mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> pass as to the act but remain as to guilt, so <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, after passing, as to the act, remain as to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, in so far as they are acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is in this respect that they are deadened, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is hindered from receiving his reward.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There is no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in withdrawing the reward from him who has deserved it, if he has made himself unworthy by his subsequent fault, since at times a man <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> forfeits through his own fault, even that which he has already received.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is not on account of the strength of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, previously done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, are deadened, but on account of the freedom of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which can be turned away from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether deeds deadened by sin, are revived by Penance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> deadened by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are not revived by Penance. Because just as past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted by subsequent Penance, so are <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> previously done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, deadened by subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> remitted by Penance do not return, as stated above (88, 1,2). Therefore it seems that neither are dead <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> revived by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are said to be deadened by comparison with animals who die, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). But a dead animal cannot be revived. Therefore neither can dead works be revived by Penance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are deserving of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But sometimes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> arises through Penance to lesser <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore he does not receive <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of his previous works; so that it seems that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> deadened by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are not revived.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> on <a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse25">Joel 2:25</a>, "I will restore to you the years, which the locust . . . hath eaten," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "I will not suffer to perish the fruit which you lost when your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was disturbed." But this fruit is the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works which was lost through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done before are revived by Penance.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have said that <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> works deadened by subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are not revived by the ensuing Penance, because they deemed such works to have passed away, so that they could not be revived. But that is no reason why they should not be revived: because they are conducive to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> (wherein their life consists) not only as actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, but also after they cease to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> actually, and as abiding in the Divine acceptance. Now, they abide thus, so far as they are concerned, even after they have been deadened by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because those works, according as they were done, will ever be acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and give <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse11">Apocalypse 3:11</a>: "Hold fast that which thou hast, that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> take thy crown." That they fail in their efficacy to bring the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who did them, to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, is due to the impediment of the supervening <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whereby he is become unworthy of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. But this impediment is removed by Penance, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are taken away thereby. Hence it follows that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> previously deadened, recover, through Penance, their efficacy in bringing him, who did them, to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, and, in other words, they are revived. It is therefore evident that deadened works are revived by Penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The very works themselves of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are removed by Penance, so that, by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy, no further stain or debt of punishment is incurred on their account: on the other hand, works done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are not removed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since they abide in His acceptance, but they are hindered on the part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who does them; wherefore if this hindrance, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who does those works, be removed, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on His side fulfills what those works deserved.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">Deeds</a> done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are not in themselves deadened, as explained above, but only with regard to a supervening impediment on the part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who does them. On the other hand, an animal dies in itself, through being deprived of the principle of life: so that the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who, through Penance, arises to lesser <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, will receive the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward according to the degree of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in which he is found. Yet he will have greater <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for the works he had done in his former <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, than for those which he did in his subsequent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: and this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the effect of subsequent Penance is to quicken even dead works?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the effect of subsequent Penance is to quicken even dead works, those, namely, that were not done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For it seems more difficult to bring to life that which has been deadened, since this is never done <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, than to quicken that which never had life, since certain living things are engendered <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> from things without life. Now deadened works are revived by Penance, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). Much more, therefore, are dead works revived.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be removed, the effect is removed. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the lack of life in works generically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, was the lack of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. which lack is removed by Penance. Therefore dead works are quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> in commenting on <a href="../bible/hag001.htm#verse26">Haggai 1:26</a>: "You have sowed much," says: "If at any time you find a sinner, among his many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, doing that which is right, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not so <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> as to forget the few <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> on account of his many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>." Now this seems to be the case chiefly when past <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> "<a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>" are removed by Penance. Therefore it seems that through Penance, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rewards the former <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done in the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which implies that they are quickened.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>): "If I should distribute all my goods to feed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it profiteth me nothing." But this would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, if, at least by subsequent Penance, they were quickened. Therefore Penance does not quicken works which before were dead.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A work is said to be dead in two ways: first, effectively, because, to wit, it is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of death, in which sense <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> works are said to be dead, according to <a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse14">Hebrews 9:14</a>: "The blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> . . . shall cleanse our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> from dead works." These dead works are not quickened but removed by Penance, according to <a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse1">Hebrews 6:1</a>: "Not laying again the foundation of Penance from dead works." Secondly, works are said to be dead privatively, because, to wit, they lack <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, which is founded on <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the result being that it is quickened as the body by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: in which sense too, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if it lack <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is said to be dead, according to <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse20">James 2:20</a>: "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> without works is dead." In this way also, all works that are generically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, are said to be dead, if they be done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, inasmuch as they fail to proceed from the principle of life; even as we might call the sound of a harp, a dead voice. Accordingly, the difference of life and death in works is in relation to the principle from which they proceed. But works cannot proceed a second time from a principle, because they are transitory, and the same identical <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> cannot be resumed. Therefore it is impossible for dead works to be quickened by Penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the physical order things whether dead or deadened lack the principle of life. But works are said to be deadened, not in relation to the principle whence they proceeded, but in relation to an extrinsic impediment; while they are said to be dead in relation to a principle. Consequently there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Works generically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are said to be dead on account of the lack of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as principles. Now the subsequent Penance does not supply that want, so as to make them proceed from such a principle. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> remembers the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> a man does when in a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not by rewarding them in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, which is due only to living works, i.e. those done from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but by a temporal reward: thus <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> declares (Hom. de Divite et Lazaro, 41 in Evang.) that "unless that rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had done some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, and had received his reward in this world, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> would certainly not have said to him: 'Thou didst receive <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in thy lifetime.'" Or again, this may mean that he will be judged less severely: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Patientia xxvi): "We cannot say that it would be better for the schismatic that by denying <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> he should suffer none of those things which he suffered by confessing Him; but we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he will be judged with less severity, than if by denying <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he had suffered none of those things. Thus the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, 'If I should deliver my body to be burned and have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it profiteth me nothing,' refer to the obtaining of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and do not exclude the possibility of being sentenced with less severity at the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a>."
