<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether any men will judge together with Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no men will judge with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse22">John 5:22-23</a>): "The Father . . . hath given all judgment to the Son, that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>." Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever judges has authority over that which he judges. Now those things about which the coming judgment will have to be, such as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and demerits, are subject to Divine authority alone. Therefore no one is competent to judge of those things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this judgment will take place not vocally but <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a>. Now the publication of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and demerits in the hearts of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> (which is like an accusation or approval), or the repayment of punishment and reward (which is like the pronouncement of the sentence) will be the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Therefore none but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will judge.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew 19:28</a>): "You also shall sit on twelve seats judging the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." Therefore, etc.

<p>Further, "The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will enter into judgment with the ancients of His people" (<a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse14">Isaiah 3:14</a>). Therefore it would seem that others also will judge together with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To judge has several significations. First it is used <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causally</a> as it were, when we say it of that which proves that some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> ought to be judged. In this sense the expression is used of certain people in comparison, in so far as some are shown to be deserving of judgment through being compared with others: for instance (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse41">Matthew 12:41</a>): "The men of Nineve shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it." To rise in judgment thus is common to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Secondly, the expression "to judge" is used equivalently, so to say; for consent to an action is considered equivalent to doing it. Wherefore those who will consent with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the Judge, by approving His sentence, will be said to judge. In this sense it will belong to all the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> to judge: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse7">Wisdom 3:7-8</a>): "The just . . . shall judge <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>." Thirdly, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to judge assessorially and by similitude, because he is like the judge in that his seat* is raised above the others: and thus assessors are said to judge. [An "assessor" is one who "sits by" the judge.] Some say that the perfect to whom judiciary power is promised (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew 19:28</a>) will judge in this sense, namely that they will be raised to the dignity of assessors, because they will appear above others at the judgment, and go forth "to meet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, into the air." But this apparently does not suffice for the fulfilment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> promise (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew 19:28</a>): "You shall sit . . . judging," for He would seem to make "judging" something additional to "sitting." Hence there is a fourth way of judging, which will be competent to perfect men as containing the decrees of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> according to which men will be judged: thus a book containing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> might be said to judge: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/rev020.htm#verse12">Apocalypse 20:12</a>): "(Judgment took her seat*) and the books were opened." [The words in brackets are not in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. <a href="../bible/rev020.htm#verse4">Apocalypse 20:4</a> we find: "I saw seats, and they sat upon them and judgment was given to them."] <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a> expounds this judging in this way (De judic. potest.), wherefore he says: "Those who persevere in Divine <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, who read every day the book of wisdom, transcribe, so to speak, in their hearts whatever they grasp by their clear insight of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>"; and further on: "What else are the hearts of those who judge, divinely instructed in all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codex</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>?" Since, however, judging denotes an action exercised on another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, it follows that, properly speaking, he is said to judge who pronounces judgment on another. But this happens in two ways. First, by his own authority: and this belongs to the one who has dominion and power over others, and to whose ruling those who are judged are subject, wherefore it belongs to him to pass judgment on them. In this sense to judge belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Secondly, to judge is to acquaint others of the sentence delivered by another's authority, that is to announce the verdict already given. In this way perfect men will judge, because they will lead others to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that these may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is due to them on account of their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>: so that this very <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is called judgment. Hence <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a> says (De judic. potest.) that for "the judges to open the books of their decree in the presence of those who are to be judged signifies that they open their hearts to the gaze of all those who are below them, and that they reveal their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in whatever pertains to the judgment."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection considers the judgment of authority which belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone: and the same answer applies to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is no reason why some of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> should not reveal certain things to others, either by way of enlightenment, as the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> enlighten the lower [Cf. I, 106],: or by way of speech as the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> speak to the higher [Cf. I, 107, 2].

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the judicial power corresponds to voluntary poverty?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the judicial power does not correspond to <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>. For it was promised to none but the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">twelve apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew 19:28</a>): "You shall sit on twelve seats, judging," etc. Since then those who are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> poor are not all <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, it would seem that the judicial power is not competent to all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to offer sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of one's own body is more than to do so of outward things. Now <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and also <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> offer sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their own body. whereas the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> poor offer sacrifice of outward things. Therefore the sublimity of the judicial power is more in keeping with <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> than with those who are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> poor.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse45">John 5:45</a>): "There is one that accuseth you, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in whom you trust--because you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not his voice," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, and (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse48">John 12:48</a>): "The word that I have spoken shall judge him in the last day." Therefore the fact that a man propounds a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, or exhorts men by word to lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life, gives him the right to judge those who scorn his utterances. But this belongs to <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>. Therefore it is more competent to <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> than to those who are poor <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through being judged <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be judge of all in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> [Cf. III, 59, 6], according to <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse27">John 5:27</a>, "He hath given Him power to do judgment, because He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>." Now those who suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>' sake are judged <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>. Therefore the judicial power is competent to them rather than to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> poor.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a superior is not judged by his inferior. Now many who will have made lawful use of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> will have greater <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> than many of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> poor. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> poor will not judge where those are to be judged.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job036.htm#verse6">Job 36:6</a>): "He saveth not the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and He giveth judgment to the poor."

<p>Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew 19:28</a>, "You who have left all things' [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'You who have followed Me']" says: "Those who left all things and followed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be the judges; those who made right use of what they had lawfully will be judged," and thus the same conclusion follows as before.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The judicial power is due especially to <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> on three counts. First, by reason of congruity, since <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> belongs to those who despise all the things of the world and cleave to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone. Consequently there is nothing in them to turn away their judgment from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, so that they are rendered competent to be judges as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> above all things. Secondly, by reason of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since exaltation corresponds by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. Now of all the things that make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> contemptible in this world <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is the chief: and for this reason the excellence of judicial power is promised to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, so that he who <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake shall be exalted. Thirdly, because <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> disposes a man to the aforesaid manner of judging. For the reason why one of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be said to judge as stated above [Cf. 1], is that he will have the heart instructed in all Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which he will be thus able to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to others. Now in the advancement to perfection, the first thing that occurs to be renounced is external <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, because this is the last thing of all to be acquired. And that which is last in the order of generation is the first in the order of destruction: wherefore among the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> whereby we advance to perfection, the first place is given to <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>. Thus judicial power corresponds to <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, in so far as this is the disposition to the aforesaid perfection. Hence also it is that this same power is not promised to all who are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> poor, but to those who leave all and follow <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in accordance with the perfection of life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xx), "we must not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that because He says that they will sit on twelve seats only twelve men will judge with Him. else since we read that <a href="../cathen/10066a.htm">Matthias</a> was appointed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> in the place of the traitor <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> who worked more than the rest will have nowhere to sit as judge." Hence "the number twelve," as he states (De Civ. Dei xx), "signifies the whole multitude of those who will judge, because the two parts of seven, namely three and four, being multiplied together make twelve." Moreover twelve is a perfect number, being the double of six, which is a perfect number.

<p>Or, speaking literally, He spoke to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">twelve apostles</a> in whose <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he made this promise to all who follow them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">Virginity</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> do not dispose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to retain the precepts of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in his heart in the same degree as <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> does: even so, on the other hand, outward <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> choke the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the cares which they entail (<a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse14">Luke 8:14</a>). Or we may reply that <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> does not suffice alone to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> judicial power, but is the fundamental part of that perfection to which the judicial power corresponds. Wherefore among those things regarding perfection which follow after <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> we may reckon both <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and all the works of perfection: yet they do not rank as high as <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, since the beginning of a thing is its chief part.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who propounded the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> or urged men to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will judge, in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> (Cf. 1) sense, because others will be judged in reference to the words he has uttered or propounded. Hence the judicial power does not properly correspond to preaching or teaching. or we may reply that, as some say, three things are requisite for the judicial power; first, that one renounce temporal cares, lest the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> be hindered from the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of wisdom; secondly that one possess Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> both as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and as to observance; thirdly that one should have taught others this same <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and this teaching will be the perfection whereby a man <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> to have judicial power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> Himself in that He was judged <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>; for "He was offered because it was His own will" (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah 53:7</a>): and by His <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> His exaltation to judicial power, since all things are made subject to Him (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians 2:8-9</a>). Hence, judicial power is more due to them who <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves of their own will by renouncing temporal goods, on account of which men are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by worldlings, than to those who are <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> by others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> An inferior cannot judge a superior by his own authority, but he can do so by the authority of a superior, as in the case of a judge-delegate. Hence it is not unfitting that it be granted to the poor as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward to judge others, even those who have higher <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in respect of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the angels will judge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will judge. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse31">Matthew 25:31</a>): "When the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall come in His majesty, and all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with Him." Now He is speaking of His coming to judgment. Therefore it would seem that also the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will judge.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the orders of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> take their names from the offices which they fulfill. Now one of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders is that of the Thrones, which would seem to pertain to the judicial power, since a throne is the "judicial bench, a royal seat, a professor's chair" [Cf. <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore</a>, Etym. vii, 5. Therefore some of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will judge.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, equality with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is promised the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> after this life (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>). If then men will have this power of judging, much more will the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse27">John 5:27</a>): "He hath given Him power to judgment, because He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in common with Him. Neither therefore do they share with Him in the judicial power.

<p>Further, the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not judge and judge's minister. Now in this judgment the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will act as ministers of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Judge</a> and, according to <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse41">Matthew 13:41</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall send His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and they shall gather out of His kingdom all <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will not judge.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The judge's assessors must be conformed to the judge. Now judgment is ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> because He will appear to all, both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, although the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> will judge by authority. Consequently it behooves also the Judge's assessors to have the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so as to be visible to all, both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Hence it is not fitting for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to judge, although in a certain sense we may say that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will judge, namely by approving the sentence [Cf. 1].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on this passage observes, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will come with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not to judge, but "as witnesses of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> deeds because it was under their guardianship that men did well or ill."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The name of Thrones is given to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in reference to the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is ever pronouncing, by governing all things with supreme <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: of which <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are in a way the executors and promulgators. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will require <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> assessors.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Equality with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is promised to men as regards the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward. But nothing hinders an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward from being bestowed on men to the exclusion of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as in the case of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins'</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> crowns: and the same may be said of the judicial power.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the demons will carry out the sentence of the Judge on the damned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> will not carry out the sentence of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Judge</a> on the damned after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>. For, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>): "He will then bring to naught [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'When He shall have brought to naught', etc.] all principality, and power, and virtue." Therefore all supremacy will cease then. But the carrying out of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Judge's</a> sentence implies some kind of supremacy. Therefore after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a> the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> will not carry out the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Judge's</a> sentence.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> more grievously than men. Therefore it is not just that men should be tortured by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">suggest</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things to men, so <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> suggest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. Now it will not be the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to reward the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but this will be done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, immediately by Himself. Therefore neither will it be the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to punish the wicked.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Sinners have subjected themselves to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Therefore it is just that they should be subjected to him in their punishments, and punished by him as it were.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> in the text of Sentent. iv, D, 47 mentions two opinions on this question, both of which seem consistent with Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, because it is just for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be subjected to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> for having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and yet it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> to be over him. Accordingly the opinion which holds that after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a> the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> will not be placed over men to punish them, regards the order of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> punishing; while the contrary opinion regards the order of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> on the part of the men punished.

<p>Which of these opinions is nearer the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain. Yet I think it truer to say that just as, among the saved, order will be observed so that some will be enlightened and perfected by others (because all the orders of the heavenly hierarchies will continue for ever) [Cf. I, 108, 7,8], so, too, will order be observed in punishments, men being punished by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, lest the Divine order, whereby the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are placed between the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and the Divine, be entirely set aside. Wherefore just as the Divine illuminations are conveyed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, so too the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> execute the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Nor does this in any way diminish the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, since even in torturing others they are themselves tortured, because then the fellowship of the unhappy will not lessen but will increase unhappiness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The supremacy which, it is declared, will be brought to nought by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the time to come must be taken in the sense of the supremacy which is in keeping with the state of this world: wherein men are placed over men, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> over men, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> over <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> over <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> over men; in every case so as either to lead towards the end or to lead astray from the end. But then when all things will have attained to that end there will be no supremacy to lead astray from the end or to lead to it, but only that which maintains in the end, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the demerit of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> does not require that they be placed over men, since they made men subject to them <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, yet this is required by the order of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in relation to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: since "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> goods remain in them unimpaired" as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the principal reward in the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, because all receive this immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of certain <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> rewards in men, in so far as the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> enlighten those beneath them, both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men, concerning certain hidden things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which do not belong to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of beatitude. In like manner the damned will receive their principal punishment immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely the everlasting banishment from the Divine vision: but there is no reason why the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> should not torture men with other sensible punishments. There is, however, this difference: that <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> exalts, whereas <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> debases. Wherefore since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is higher than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, some on account of the excellence of their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> will be so far exalted as to be raised above the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> both in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and rewards [Cf. I, 108, 8], so that some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will be enlightened by some men. On the other hand, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sinners will, on account of a certain degree of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, attain to the eminence that attaches to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether all men will be present at the judgment?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that men will not all be present at the judgment. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew 19:28</a>): "You . . . shall sit on twelve seats, judging the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." But all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> do not belong to those twelve tribes. Therefore it would seem that men will not all be present at the judgment.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the same apparently is to be gathered from <a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse5">Psalm 1:5</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall not rise again in judgment."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man is brought to judgment that his merits may be discussed. But some there are who have acquired no merits, such as children who died before reaching the <a href="../cathen/01209a.htm">perfect age</a>. Therefore they need not be present at the judgment. Now there are many such. Therefore it would seem that not all will be present.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse42">Acts 10:42</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "was appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be judge of the living and of the dead." Now this division comprises all men, no matter how the living be distinct from the dead. Therefore all men will be present at the judgment.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse7">Apocalypse 1:7</a>): "Behold He cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him." Now this would not be so unless all were present at the judgment. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The judicial power was bestowed on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in reward for the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> which He showed forth in His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>. Now in His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> He shed His blood for all in point of sufficiency, although through meeting with an obstacle in some, it had not its effect in all. Therefore it is fitting that all men should assemble at the judgment, to see His exaltation in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in respect of which "He was appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be judge of the living and of the dead."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xx, 5), "it does not follow from the saying, 'Judging the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">twelve tribes of Israel</a>,' that the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">tribe of Levi</a>, which is the thirteenth, is not to be judged, or that they will judge that people alone, and not other nations." The reason why all other nations are denoted by the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">twelve tribes</a> is because they were called by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to take the place of the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">twelve tribes</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The words, "The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall not rise in judgment," if referred to all sinners, mean that they will not arise to judge. But if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> denote unbelievers, the sense is that they will not arise to be judged, because they are "already judged" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse18">John 3:18</a>). All, however, will rise again to assemble at the judgment and witness the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Judge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even children who have died before reaching the perfect age will be present at the judgment, not to be judged, but to see the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Judge's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the good will be judged at the judgment?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that none of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will be judged at the judgment. For it is declared (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse18">John 3:18</a>) that "he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in Him is not judged." Now all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him. Therefore they will not be judged.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those who are uncertain of their bliss are not blessed: whence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> proves (Gen. ad lit. xi) that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were never blessed. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are now blessed. Therefore they are certain of their bliss. Now what is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> is not submitted to judgment. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will not be judged.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fear is incompatible with bliss. But the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a>, which above all is described as terrible, cannot take place without inspiring fear into those who are to be judged. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> observes on <a href="../bible/job041.htm#verse16">Job 41:16</a> "When he shall raise him up, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> shall fear," etc. (Moral. xxxiv): "Consider how the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will then be troubled when even the just are disturbed about their life." Therefore the blessed will not be judged.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It would seem that all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will be judged, since it is written (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>): "We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Now there is nothing else to be judged. Therefore all, even the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, will be judged.

<p>Further, the "general" includes all. Now this is called the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">general judgment</a>. Therefore all will be judged.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The judgment comprises two things, namely the discussion of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and the payment of rewards. As regards the payment of rewards, all will be judged, even the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since the Divine sentence will appoint to each one the reward corresponding to his <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. But there is no discussion of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> save where <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> are mingled together. Now those who build on the foundation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, "gold, silver, and precious stones" (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 3:12</a>), by devoting themselves wholly to the Divine service, and who have no notable admixture of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, are not subjected to a discussion of their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Such are those who have entirely renounced the things of the world and are solicitously thoughtful of the things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore they will be saved but will not be judged. Others, however, build on the foundation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, wood, hay, stubble [Cf. I-II, 89, 2]; they, in fact, love worldly things and are busy about earthly concerns, yet so as to prefer nothing to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but strive to redeem their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and these have an admixture of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Hence they are subjected to a discussion of their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, and consequently in this account will be judged, and yet they will be saved.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since punishment is the effect of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, while reward is the effect of mercy, it follows that punishment is more especially ascribed antonomastically to judgment which is the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; so that judgment is sometimes used to express condemnation. It is thus that we are to understand the words quoted, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the passage remarks.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> will be discussed, not to remove the uncertainty of their beatitude from the hearts of those who are to be judged, but that it may be made manifest to us that their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> outweigh their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, and thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> is speaking of the just who will still be in mortal flesh, wherefore he had already said: "Those who will still be in the body, although already brave and perfect, yet through being still in the flesh must needs be troubled with fear in the midst of such a whirlwind of terror." Hence it is clear that this fear refers to the time immediately before the judgment, most terrible indeed to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but not to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, who will have no apprehension of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The arguments in the contrary sense consider judgment as regards the payment of rewards.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the wicked will be judged?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that none of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will be judged. For even as damnation is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> in the case of unbelievers, so is it in the case of those who die in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it is declared because of the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of damnation (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse18">John 3:18</a>): "He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not is already judged." Therefore in like manner neither will other sinners be judged.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the voice of the Judge is most terrible to those who are condemned by His judgment. Now according to the text of Sentent. iv, D, 47 and in the words of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxvi) "the Judge will not address Himself to unbelievers." If therefore He were to address Himself to the believers about to be condemned, the unbelievers would reap a benefit from their unbelief, which is absurd.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It would seem that all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are to be judged, because all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will be sentenced to punishment according to the degree of their guilt. But this cannot be done without a judicial pronouncement. Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will be judged.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The judgment as regards the sentencing to punishment for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> concerns all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. whereas the judgment as regards the discussion of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> concerns only believers. Because in unbelievers the foundation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is lacking, without which all subsequent works are deprived of the perfection of a right <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, so that in them there is no admixture of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works or <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> requiring discussion. But believers in whom the foundation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> remains, have at least a praiseworthy act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which though it is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, yet is in itself directed to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, and consequently they will be subjected to the discussion of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Consequently, believers who were at least counted as citizens of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">City of God</a> will be judged as citizens, and sentence of death will not be passed on them without a discussion of their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>; whereas unbelievers will be condemned as foes, who are wont among men to be exterminated without their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> being discussed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that those who die in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will be damned, nevertheless since they have an admixture of certain things connected with meriting well, it behooves, for the manifestation of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> be subjected to discussion, in order to make it clear that they are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> banished from the city of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, of which they appeared outwardly to be citizens.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Considered under this special aspect the words addressed to the believers about to be condemned will not be terrible, because they will reveal in them certain things pleasing to them, which it will be impossible to find in unbelievers, since "without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is impossible to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>). But the sentence of condemnation which will be passed on them all will be terrible to all of them.

<p>The argument in the contrary sense considered the judgment of retribution.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether at the coming judgment the angels will be judged?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will be judged at the coming judgment. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 6:3</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not that we shall judge <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>?" But this cannot refer to the state of the present time. Therefore it should refer to the judgment to come.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written concerning Behemoth or Leviathan, whereby the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is signified (<a href="../bible/job040.htm#verse28">Job 40:28</a>): "In the sight of all he shall be cast down"; and (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse24">Mark 1:24</a>)* the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> cried out to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: "Why art Thou come to destroy us before the time?" for, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> seeing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> on earth thought they were to be judged forthwith." [The reference should be <a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse29">Matthew 8:29</a>: 'Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time?' The text of Mark reads: 'Art Thou come to destroy us?'] Therefore it would seem that a final judgment is in store for them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse4">2 Peter 2:4</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spared not the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, but delivered them drawn down by infernal ropes to the lower <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, unto torments, to be reserved unto judgment." Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will be judged.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/nah001.htm#verse9">Nahum 1:9</a>) according to the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint version</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not judge the same thing a second time." But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are already judged, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse11">John 16:11</a>): "The prince of this world is already judged." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will not be judged in the time to come.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> are more perfect in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> than in men who are wayfarers. Now some men, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, will not be judged as stated in the text of Sentent. iv, D, 47. Therefore neither will <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> be judged.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The judgment of discussion nowise concerns either the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, since neither is any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be found in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, nor is any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> liable to judgment to be found in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But if we speak of the judgment of retribution, we must distinguish a twofold retribution. One corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>' personal <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and was made to both from the beginning when some were raised to bliss, and others plunged into the depths of woe. The other corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, procured through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and this retribution will be made in the judgment to come, because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will have an increased <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those whom they have prompted to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will have an increase of torment through the manifold downfall of those whom they have incited to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Consequently the judgment will not regard the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> directly, neither as judging nor as judged, but only men; but it will regard the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> indirectly somewhat, in so far as they were concerned in men's <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> refers to the judgment of comparison, because certain men will be found to be placed higher than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> will then be cast down in the sight of all because they will be imprisoned for ever in the dungeon of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, so that they will no more be free to go out, since this was permitted to them only in so far as they were directed by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> to try the life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The same answer applies to the Third Objection.
