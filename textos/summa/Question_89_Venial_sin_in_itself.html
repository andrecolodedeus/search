<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether venial sin causes a stain on the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a stain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Poenit.) [Hom. 50, inter. L., 2, that if venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be multiplied, they destroy the beauty of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> so as to deprive us of the embraces of our heavenly spouse. But the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is nothing else but the loss of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> beauty. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a stain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a stain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, on account of the inordinateness of the act and of the sinner's affections. But, in venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there is an inordinateness of the act and of the affections. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a stain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the stain on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by contact with a temporal thing, through love thereof as stated above (Question 86, Article 1). But, in venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in contact with a temporal thing through inordinate love. therefore, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> brings a stain on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> it is written, (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse27">Ephesians 5:27</a>): "That He might present it to Himself a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> church, not having spot or wrinkle," on which the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "i.e., some grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore it seems proper to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a stain on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that</strong> as stated above (Question 86, Article 1), a stain denotes a loss of comeliness due to contact with something, as may be seen in corporeal matters, from which the term has been transferred to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by way of similitude. Now, just as in the body there is a twofold comeliness, one resulting from the inward disposition of the members and colors, the other resulting from outward refulgence supervening, so too, in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, there is a twofold comeliness, one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> and, so to speak, intrinsic, the other actual like an outward flash of light. Now venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a hindrance to actual comeliness, but not to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> comeliness, because it neither destroys nor diminishes the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as we shall show further on (II-II, 24, 10; 133, 1, ad 2), but only hinders their acts. On the other hand a stain denotes something permanent in the thing stained, wherefore it seems in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a loss of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> rather than of actual comeliness. Therefore, properly speaking, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a stain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. If, however, we find it stated anywhere that it does induce a stain, this is in a restricted sense, in so far as it hinders the comeliness that results from acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking of the case in which many venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> lead to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> dispositively: because otherwise they would not sever the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from its heavenly spouse.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the inordinateness of the act destroys the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but not in venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> comes into contact with a temporal thing as its end, so that the shedding of the light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which accrues to those who, by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, cleave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their last end, is entirely cut off.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> in venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not cleave to a creature as his last end: hence there is no comparison.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether venial sins are suitably designated as "wood, hay, and stubble"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are unsuitably designated as "wood," "hay," and "stubble." Because wood hay and stubble are said (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 3:12</a>) to be built on a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> foundation. Now venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are something outside a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> foundation, even as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinions are outside the pale of science. Therefore, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not suitably designated as wood, hay and stubble.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he who builds wood, hay and stubble, "shall be saved yet so as by fire" (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>). But sometimes the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who commits a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, will not be saved, even by fire, e.g. when a man dies in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to which venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are attached. Therefore, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are unsuitably designated by wood, hay, and stubble.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 3:12</a>) those who build "gold, silver, precious stones," i.e. love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, are others from those who build wood, hay, and stubble. But those even who love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and their neighbor, and do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, commit venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1 John 1:8</a>): "If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves." Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not suitably designated by these three.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, there are many more than three differences and degrees of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore they are unsuitably comprised under these three.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who builds up wood, hay and stubble, "shall be saved yet so as by fire," so that he will suffer punishment, but not everlasting. Now the debt of temporal punishment belongs properly to venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 87, Article 5). Therefore these three signify venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have understood the "foundation" to be dead <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, upon which some build <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, signified by gold, silver, and precious stones, while others build mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which according to them are designated by wood, hay and stubble. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> disapproves of this explanation (De Fide et Oper. xv), because, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse21">Galatians 5:21</a>), he who does the works of the flesh, "shall not obtain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>," which signifies to be saved; whereas the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says that he who builds wood, hay, and stubble "shall be saved yet so as by fire." Consequently wood, hay, stubble cannot be understood to denote mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>Others say that wood, hay, stubble designate <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, which are indeed built upon the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> edifice, but are mixed with venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: as, when a man is charged with the care of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing, excessive love of his wife or of his children or of his possessions insinuates itself into his life, under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> however, so that, to wit, for the sake of these things he would be unwilling to do anything in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But neither does this seem to be reasonable. For it is evident that all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works are referred to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and one's neighbor, wherefore they are designated by "gold," "silver," and "precious stones," and consequently not by "wood," "hay," and "stubble."

<p>We must therefore say that the very venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that insinuate themselves into those who have a care for earthly things, are designated by wood, hay, and stubble. For just as these are stored in a house, without belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the house, and can be burnt, while the house is saved, so also venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are multiplied in a man, while the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> edifice remains, and for them, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suffers fire, either of temporal trials in this life, or of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> after this life, and yet he is saved for ever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not said to be built upon the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> foundation, as though they were laid directly upon it, but because they are laid beside it; in the same sense as it is written (<a href="../bible/psa136.htm#verse1">Psalm 136:1</a>): "Upon the waters of Babylon," i.e. "beside the waters": because venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not destroy the edifice.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not said that everyone who builds wood, hay and stubble, shall be saved as by fire, but only those who build "upon" the "foundation." And this foundation is not dead <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as some have esteemed, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians 3:17</a>: "Rooted and founded in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Accordingly, he that dies in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, has indeed wood, hay, and stubble, but not built upon the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> edifice; and consequently he will not be saved so as by fire.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although those who are withdrawn from the care of temporal things, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially sometimes, yet they commit but slight venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and in most cases they are cleansed by the fervor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: wherefore they do not build up venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because these do not remain long in them. But the venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who are busy about earthly remain longer, because they are unable to have such frequent recourse to the fervor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in order to remove them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Coelo i, text. 2), "all things are comprised under three, the beginning, the middle, the end." Accordingly all degrees of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are reduced to three, viz. to "wood," which remains longer in the fire; "stubble," which is burnt up at once; and "hay," which is between these two: because venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are removed by fire, quickly or slowly, according as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more or less attached to them.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether man could commit a venial sin in the state of innocence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could commit a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the state of innocence. Because on <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse14">1 Timothy 2:14</a>, "<a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was not <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduced</a>," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Having had no experience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> severity, it was possible for him to be so mistaken as to think that what he had done was a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." But he would not have thought this unless he could have committed a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore he could commit a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 5): "We must not suppose that the tempter would have overcome <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unless first of all there had arisen in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a movement of vainglory which should have been checked." Now the vainglory which preceded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> defeat, which was accomplished through his falling into mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, could be nothing more than a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In like manner, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 5) that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was allured by a certain desire of making the experiment, when he saw that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> did not die when she had taken the forbidden fruit." Again there seems to have been a certain movement of unbelief in Eve, since she <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> what the Lord had said, as appears from her saying (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse3">Genesis 3:3</a>): "Lest perhaps we die." Now these apparently were venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could commit a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> before he committed a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more opposed to the integrity of the original state, than venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally notwithstanding the integrity of the original state. Therefore he could also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deserves some punishment. But nothing penal was possible in the state of innocence, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10). Therefore he could commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that would not deprive him of that state of integrity. But venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not change <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> state. Therefore he could not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is generally admitted that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not commit a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the state of innocence. This, however, is not to be understood as though on account of the perfection of his state, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is venial for us would have been mortal for him, if he had committed it. Because the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is circumstance that aggravates a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but it does not transfer it to another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, unless there be an additional deformity by reason of disobedience, or <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> or the like, which does not apply to the question in point. Consequently what is venial in itself could not be changed into mortal by reason of the excellence of the original state. We must therefore understand this to mean that he could not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially, because it was impossible for him to commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which was venial in itself, before losing the integrity of the original state by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> mortally.

<p>The reason for this is because venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> occurs in us, either through the imperfection of the act, as in the case of sudden movements, in a genus of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or through some inordinateness in respect of things referred to the end, the due order of the end being safeguarded. Now each of these happens on account of some defect of order, by reason of the lower powers not being checked by the higher. Because the sudden rising of a movement of the sensuality in us is due to the sensuality not being perfectly subject to reason: and the sudden rising of a movement of reason itself is due, in us, to the fact that the execution of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is not subject to the act of deliberation which proceeds from a higher <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (Question 74, Article 10); and that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind be out of order as regards things directed to the end, the due order of the end being safeguarded, is due to the fact that the things referred to the end are not infallibly directed under the end, which holds the highest place, being the beginning, as it were, in matters concerning the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated above (10, A1,2, ad 3; 72, 5). Now, in the state of innocence, as stated in the I, 95, 1, there was an unerring stability of order, so that the lower powers were always subjected to the higher, so long as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> remained subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 13). Hence there can be no inordinateness in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unless first of all the highest part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were not subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which constitutes a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. From this it is evident that, in the state of innocence, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not commit a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, before committing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the passage quoted, venial is not taken in the same sense as we take it now; but by venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we mean that which is easily forgiven.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This vainglory which preceded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> downfall, was his first mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for it is stated to have preceded his downfall into the outward act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This vainglory was followed, in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by the desire to make and experiment, and in the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, by <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, for she gave way to vainglory, merely through hearing the serpent mention the precept, as though she refused to be held in check by the precept.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to the integrity of the original state in the fact of its destroying that state: this a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot do. And because the integrity of the primitive state is incompatible with any inordinateness whatever, the result is that the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially, before committing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a good or a wicked angel can sin venially?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially. Because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> agrees with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the higher part of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is called the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, who says (Hom. xxix in Evang.) that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> understands in common with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can commit a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the higher part of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can commit a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, He that can do more can do less. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> could love a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> more than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he did, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> mortally. Therefore he could also love a creature less than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> inordinately, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> venially.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> seem to do things which are venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> generically, by provoking men to laughter, and other like frivolities. Now the circumstance of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> does not make a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be venial as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), unless there is a special prohibition, which is not the case in point. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The perfection of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is greater than that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the primitive state. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially in the primitive state, and much less, therefore, can an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as stated above in the I, 58, 3; I, 79, 8, is not discursive, i.e. it does not proceed from principles to conclusions, so as to understand both separately, as we do. Consequently, whenever the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> considers a conclusion, it must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, consider it in its principles. Now in matters of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as we have often stated (8, 2; 10, 1; 72, 5), ends are like principles, while the means are like conclusions. Wherefore, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> mind is not directed to the means, except as they stand under the order to the end. Consequently, from their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, they can have no inordinateness in respect of the means, unless at the same time they have an inordinateness in respect of the end, and this is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not moved to the means, except in subordination to the due end which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore all their acts are acts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so that no venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be in them. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are moved to nothing except in subordination to the end which is their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Therefore they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally in everything that they do of their own will. This does not apply to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> we have stated to be in them (I, 63, 4; 64, 2, ad 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Man does indeed agree with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but he differs in his mode of understanding, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> could not love a creature less than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without, at the same time, either referring it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the last end, or to some inordinate end, for the reason given above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> incite <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to all such things which seem venial, that he may become used to them, so as to lead him on to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently in all such things they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally, on account of the end they have in view.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the first movements of the sensuality in unbelievers are mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the first movements of the sensuality in unbelievers are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse1">Romans 8:1</a>) that "there is . . . no condemnation to them that are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, who walk not according to the flesh": and he is speaking there of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the sensuality, as appears from the context (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm">Romans 7</a>). Therefore the reason why <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not a matter of condemnation to those who walk not according to the flesh, i.e. by consenting to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, is because they are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. But unbelievers are not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. Therefore in unbelievers this is a matter of condemnation. Therefore the first movements of unbelievers are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (De Gratia et Lib. Arb. vii): "Those who are not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when they feel the sting of the flesh, follow the road of damnation, even if they walk not according to the flesh." But damnation is not due save to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> feels the sting of the flesh in the first movements of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, it seems that the first movements of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> in unbelievers are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (De Gratia et Lib. Arb. vii): "Man was so made that he was not liable to feel <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>." Now this liability seems to be remitted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which the unbeliever has not. Therefore every act of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> in an unbeliever, even without his consent, is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he acts against his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated in <a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse34">Acts 10:34</a> that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>." Therefore he does not impute to one unto condemnation, what He does not impute to another. But he does not impute first movements to believers, unto condemnation. Neither therefore does He impute them to unbelievers.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is unreasonable to say that the first movements of unbelievers are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when they do not consent to them. This is evident for two reasons. First, because the sensuality itself could not be the subject of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 79, Article 4). Now the sensuality has the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in unbelievers as in believers. Therefore it is not possible for the mere movements of the sensuality in unbelievers, to be mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Secondly, from the state of the sinner. Because excellence of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> never diminishes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but, on the contrary, increases it, as stated above (Question 73, Article 10). Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not less grievous in a believer than in an unbeliever, but much more so. For the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of an unbeliever are more deserving of forgiveness, on account of their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse13">1 Timothy 1:13</a>: "I obtained the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because I did it ignorantly in my unbelief": whereas the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of believers are more grievous on account of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse29">Hebrews 10:29</a>: "How much more, do you think, he deserveth worse punishments . . . who hath esteemed the blood of the testament <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, by which he was sanctified?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking of the condemnation due to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, which condemnation is remitted by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, although the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> remain. Wherefore the fact that believers are subject to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not in them a sign of the condemnation due to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as it is in unbelievers.

<p>In this way also is to be understood the saying of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a>, wherefore the Reply to the Second Objection is evident.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This freedom from liability to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> was a result of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Wherefore that which is opposed to such liability pertains, not to actual but to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether venial sin can be in anyone with original sin alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be in a man with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> alone. For disposition precedes <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a disposition to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 88, Article 3). Therefore in an unbeliever, in whom <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not remitted, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> before mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and so sometimes unbelievers have venial together with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, and without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has less in common, and less connection with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, than one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has with another. But an unbeliever in the state of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, can commit one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without committing another. Therefore he can also commit a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without committing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is possible to fix the time at which a child is first able to commit an actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and when the child comes to that time, it can stay a short time at least, without committing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because this happens in the worst criminals. Now it is possible for the child to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially during that space of time, however short it may be. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be in anyone with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> alone and without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is punished for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> in the children's <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>, where there is no pain of sense as we shall state further on (II-II, 69, 6): whereas men are punished in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> for no other than mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore there will be no place where a man can be punished for venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with no other than <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be in anyone with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> alone, and without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The reason for this is because before a man comes to the age of discretion, the lack of years hinders the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and excuses him from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wherefore, much more does it excuse him from venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if he does anything which is such generically. But when he begins to have the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, he is not entirely excused from the guilt of venial or mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the first thing that occurs to a man to think about then, is to deliberate about himself. And if he then direct himself to the due end, he will, by means of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, receive the remission of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>: whereas if he does not then direct himself to the due end, and as far as he is capable of discretion at that particular age, he will <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally, for through not doing that which is in his power to do. Accordingly thenceforward there cannot be venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in him without mortal, until afterwards all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall have been remitted to him through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> always precedes mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, but as a contingent disposition, just as work sometimes disposes to fever, but not as heat disposes to the form of fire.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is prevented from being with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> alone, not on account of its want of connection or likeness, but on account of the lack of use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The child that is beginning to have the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> can refrain from other mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> for a time, but it is not free from the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, unless it turns to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as soon as possible. For the first thing that occurs to a man who has discretion, is to think of himself, and to direct other things to himself as to their end, since the end is the first thing in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Therefore this is the time when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> affirmative precept, which the Lord expressed by saying (<a href="../bible/zec001.htm#verse3">Zechariah 1:3</a>): "Turn ye to Me . . . and I will turn to you."
