<h1>Question 8. The existence of God in things</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1008.htm#article1"> Is God in all things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1008.htm#article2"> Is God everywhere?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1008.htm#article3"> Is God everywhere by essence, power, and presence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1008.htm#article4"> Does it belong to God alone to be everywhere?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether God is in all things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in all things. For what is above all things is not in all things. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is above all, according to the Psalm (<a href="../bible/psa112.htm#verse4">Psalm 112:4</a>), "The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is high above all nations," etc. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in all things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is in anything is thereby contained. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not contained by things, but rather does He contain them. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in things but things are rather in Him. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. 20), that "in Him things are, rather than He is in any place."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more powerful an agent is, the more extended is its action. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the most powerful of all agents. Therefore His action can extend to things which are far removed from Him; nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that He should be in all things.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are beings. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; for there is no fellowship between light and darkness (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in all things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A thing is wherever it operates. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> operates in all things, according to <a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse12">Isaiah 26:12</a>, "Lord . . . Thou hast wrought all our works in [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'for'] us." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in all things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in all things; not, indeed, as part of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, nor as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, but as an agent is present to that upon which it works. For an agent must be joined to that wherein it acts immediately and touch it by its power; hence it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. vii that the thing moved and the mover must be joined together. Now since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is very being by His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, created being must be His proper effect; as to ignite is the proper effect of fire. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> this effect in things not only when they first begin to be, but as long as they are preserved in being; as light is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in the air by the sun as long as the air remains illuminated. Therefore as long as a thing has being, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must be present to it, according to its mode of being. But being is innermost in each thing and most fundamentally inherent in all things since it is formal in respect of everything found in a thing, as was shown above (Question 7, Article 1). Hence it must be that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in all things, and innermostly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is above all things by the excellence of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; nevertheless, He is in all things as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the being of all things; as was shown above in this article.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although corporeal things are said to be in another as in that which contains them, nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things contain those things in which they are; as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> contains the body. Hence also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in things containing them; nevertheless, by a certain similitude to corporeal things, it is said that all things are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; inasmuch as they are contained by Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> No action of an agent, however powerful it may be, acts at a distance, except through a medium. But it belongs to the great power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that He acts immediately in all things. Hence nothing is distant from Him, as if it could be without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in itself. But things are said to be distant from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the unlikeness to Him in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; as also He is above all by the excellence of His own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> there is their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and also the deformity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is not from Him; therefore, it is not to be absolutely conceded that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, except with the addition, "inasmuch as they are beings." But in things not deformed in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, we must say absolutely that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether God is everywhere?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not everywhere. For to be everywhere means to be in every place. But to be in every place does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom it does not belong to be in place at all; for "incorporeal things," as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Hebdom.), "are not in a place." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not everywhere.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the relation of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to succession is the same as the relation of place to permanence. But one indivisible part of action or movement cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in different times; therefore neither can one indivisible part in the genus of permanent things be in every place. Now the divine being is not successive but permanent. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in many places; and thus He is not everywhere.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is wholly in any one place is not in part elsewhere. But if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in any one place He is all there; for He has no parts. No part of Him then is elsewhere; and therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not everywhere.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written, "I fill heaven and earth." (<a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse24">Jeremiah 23:24</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since place is a thing, to be in place can be understood in a twofold sense; either by way of other things--i.e. as one thing is said to be in another no matter how; and thus the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of a place are in place; or by a way proper to place; and thus things placed are in a place. Now in both these senses, in some way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in every place; and this is to be everywhere.

<p>First, as He is in all things giving them being, power and operation; so He is in every place as giving it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and locative power. Again, things placed are in place, inasmuch as they fill place; and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> fills every place; not, indeed, like a body, for a body is said to fill place inasmuch as it excludes the co-presence of another body; whereas by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> being in a place, others are not thereby excluded from it; indeed, by the very fact that He gives being to the things that fill every place, He Himself fills every place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Incorporeal things are in place not by contact of dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as bodies are but by contact of power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The indivisible is twofold. One is the term of the continuous; as a point in permanent things, and as a moment in succession; and this kind of the indivisible in permanent things, forasmuch as it has a determinate site, cannot be in many parts of place, or in many places; likewise the indivisible of action or movement, forasmuch as it has a determinate order in movement or action, cannot be in many parts of time. Another kind of the indivisible is outside of the whole genus of the continuous; and in this way <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">incorporeal substances</a>, like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, are called indivisible. Such a kind of indivisible does not belong to the continuous, as a part of it, but as touching it by its power; hence, according as its power can extend itself to one or to many, to a small thing, or to a great one, in this way it is in one or in many places, and in a small or large place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A whole is so called with reference to its parts. Now part is twofold: viz. a part of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as the form and the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are called parts of the composite, while genus and difference are called parts of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. There is also part of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> into which any <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is divided. What therefore is whole in any place by totality of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, cannot be outside of that place, because the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of anything placed is commensurate to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the place; and hence there is no totality of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> without totality of place. But totality of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not commensurate to the totality of place. Hence it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for that which is whole by totality of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in a thing, not to be at all outside of it. This appears also in <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> forms which have <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; as an example, whiteness is whole in each part of the surface if we speak of its totality of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; because according to the perfect <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> it is found to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in every part of the surface. But if its totality be considered according to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> which it has <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, then it is not whole in every part of the surface. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">incorporeal substances</a> have no totality either of themselves or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, except in reference to the perfect <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Hence, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is whole in every part of the body, so is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whole in all things and in each one.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God is everywhere by essence, presence and power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the mode of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in all things is not properly described by way of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, presence and power. For what is by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in anything, is in it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in things; for He does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of anything. Therefore it ought not to be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in things by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, presence and power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to be present in anything means not to be absent from it. Now this is the meaning of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> being in things by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, that He is not absent from anything. Therefore the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all things by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and presence means the same thing. Therefore it is superfluous to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is present in things by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, presence and power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by His power is the principle of all things, so He is the same likewise by His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and will. But it is not said that He is in things by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and will. Therefore neither is He present by His power.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a perfection added to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a thing, so many other perfections are likewise added. Therefore if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be in certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in a special way by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it seems that according to every perfection there ought to be a special mode of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the Canticle of Canticles (5) says that, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by a common mode is in all things by His presence, power and <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; still He is said to be present more familiarly in some by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>" [The quotation is from <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, (Hom. viii in Ezech.)].

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be in a thing in two ways; in one way after the manner of an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and thus He is in all things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by Him; in another way he is in things as the object of operation is in the operator; and this is proper to the operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according as the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in the one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; and the thing desired in the one desiring. In this second way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is especially in the rational creature which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and loves Him actually or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>. And because the rational creature possesses this prerogative by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as will be shown later (12). He is said to be thus in the saints by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p>But how He is in other things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by Him, may be considered from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. A king, for example, is said to be in the whole kingdom by his power, although he is not everywhere present. Again a thing is said to be by its presence in other things which are subject to its inspection; as things in a house are said to be present to anyone, who nevertheless may not be in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in every part of the house. Lastly, a thing is said to be by way of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in that place in which its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> may be. Now there were some (the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichees</a>) who said that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and incorporeal things were subject to the divine power; but that visible and corporeal things were subject to the power of a contrary principle. Therefore against these it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in all things by His power.

<p>But others, though they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that all things were subject to the divine power, still did not allow that <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> extended to these inferior bodies, and in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of these it is said, "He walketh about the poles of the heavens; and He doth not consider our things [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'He doth not consider . . . and He walketh,' etc.]" (<a href="../bible/job022.htm#verse14">Job 22:14</a>). Against these it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in all things by His <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">presence</a>.

<p>Further, others said that, although all things are subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, still all things are not immediately <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but that He immediately <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> the first creatures, and these <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> the others. Against these it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that He is in all things by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p>Therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in all things by His power, inasmuch as all things are subject to His power; He is by His <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">presence</a> in all things, as all things are bare and open to His eyes; He is in all things by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, inasmuch as He is <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">present</a> to all as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be in all things by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, not indeed by the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the things themselves, as if He were of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; but by His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; because His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">present</a> to all things as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A thing can be said to be present to another, when in its sight, though the thing may be distant in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as was shown in this article; and therefore two modes of presence are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; viz. by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and by presence.

But power is the principle of acting on another; hence by power the agent is related and applied to an external thing; thus by power an agent may be said to be present to another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> No other perfection, except <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, added to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, renders <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> present in anything as the object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and loved; therefore only <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> constitutes a special mode of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in things. There is, however, another special mode of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by union, which will be treated of in its own place (III).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether to be everywhere belongs to God alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that to be everywhere does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. For the universal, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Poster. i), is everywhere, and always; primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> also, since it is in all bodies, is everywhere. But neither of these is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as appears from what is said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore to be everywhere does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, number is in things numbered. But the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is constituted in number, as appears from the Book of Wisdom (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse21">Wisdom 11:21</a>). Therefore there is some number which is in the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and is thus everywhere.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is a kind of "whole perfect body" (Coel. et Mund. i). But the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is everywhere, because there is no place outside it. Therefore to be everywhere does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if any body were <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, no place would <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> outside of it, and so it would be everywhere. Therefore to be everywhere does not appear to belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 6), is "whole in the whole body, and whole in every one of its parts." Therefore if there was only one animal in the world, its <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would be everywhere; and thus to be everywhere does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. 137), "The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> feels where it sees, and lives where it feels, and is where it lives." But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sees as it were everywhere: for in a succession of glances it comprehends the entire space of the heavens in its sight. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is everywhere.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Spir. Sanct. i, 7): "Who dares to call the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> a creature, Who in all things, and everywhere, and always is, which assuredly belongs to the divinity alone?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To be everywhere primarily and absolutely, is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now to be everywhere primarily is said of that which in its whole self is everywhere; for if a thing were everywhere according to its parts in different places, it would not be primarily everywhere, forasmuch as what belongs to anything according to part does not belong to it primarily; thus if a man has white teeth, whiteness belongs primarily not to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> but to his teeth. But a thing is everywhere absolutely when it does not belong to it to be everywhere <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, that is, merely on some supposition; as a grain of millet would be everywhere, supposing that no other body existed. It belongs therefore to a thing to be everywhere absolutely when, on any supposition, it must be everywhere; and this properly belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. For whatever number of places be supposed, even if an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number be supposed besides what already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be in all of them; for nothing can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> except by Him. Therefore to be everywhere primarily and absolutely belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and is proper to Him: because whatever number of places be supposed to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must be in all of them, not as to a part of Him, but as to His very self.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The universal, and also primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are indeed everywhere; but not according to the same mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Number, since it is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, does not, of itself, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in place, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; neither is the whole but only part of it in each of the things numbered; hence it does not follow that it is primarily and absolutely everywhere.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The whole body of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is everywhere, but not primarily; forasmuch as it is not wholly in each place, but according to its parts; nor again is it everywhere absolutely, because, supposing that other places existed besides itself, it would not be in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> If an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> body existed, it would be everywhere; but according to its parts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Were there one animal only, its <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would be everywhere primarily indeed, but only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> When it is said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sees anywhere, this can be taken in two senses. In one sense the adverb "anywhere" determines the act of seeing on the part of the object; and in this sense it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that while it sees the heavens, it sees in the heavens; and in the same way it feels in the heavens; but it does not follow that it lives or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the heavens, because to live and to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> do not import an act passing to an exterior object. In another sense it can be understood according as the adverb determines the act of the seer, as proceeding from the seer; and thus it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that where the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> feels and sees, there it is, and there it lives according to this mode of speaking; and thus it does not follow that it is everywhere.
