<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether understanding is a gift of the Holy Ghost?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that understanding is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are distinct from the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since they are given in addition to the latter. Now understanding is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whereby self-evident principles are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, as stated in Ethic. vi, 6. Therefore it should not be reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the Divine <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are shared by creatures according to their capacity and mode, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). Now the mode of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not simply (which is a sign of understanding), but discursively (which is a sign of reason), as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> explains (Div. Nom. vii). Therefore the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is bestowed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, should be called a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of reason rather than a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the understanding is condivided with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> (De Anima iii, 9,10). Now no <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is called after the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> should receive the name of understanding.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> shall rest upon him, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of wisdom of understanding."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Understanding implies an intimate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, for "intelligere" [to understand] is the same as "intus legere" [to read inwardly]. This is clear to anyone who considers the difference between <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and sense, because sensitive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is concerned with external sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> penetrates into the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing, because the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is "what a thing is," as stated in De Anima iii, 6.

<p>Now there are many kinds of things that are hidden within, to find which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has to penetrate within so to speak. Thus, under the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> lies hidden the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> reality, under words lies hidden their meaning; under likenesses and figures the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they denote lies hidden (because the intelligible world is enclosed within as compared with the sensible world, which is perceived externally), and effects lie hidden in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, and vice versa. Hence we may speak of understanding with regard to all these things.

<p>Since, however, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> begins with the outside of things as it were, it is evident that the stronger the light of the understanding, the further can it penetrate into the heart of things. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light of our understanding is of finite power; wherefore it can reach to a certain fixed point. Consequently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> light in order to penetrate further still so as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light: and this <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> light which is bestowed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is called the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light instilled within us, manifests only certain general principles, which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. But since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ordained to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as stated above (2, 3; I-II, 3, 8), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs to reach to certain higher <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, for which he requires the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The discourse of reason always begins from an understanding and ends at an understanding; because we reason by proceeding from certain understood principles, and the discourse of reason is perfected when we come to understand what hitherto we ignored. Hence the act of reasoning proceeds from something previously understood. Now a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not proceed from the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but is added thereto as perfecting it. Wherefore this addition is not called "reason" but "understanding," since the additional light is in comparison with what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> supernaturally, what the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light is in regard to those things which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from the first.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> "Will" denotes simply a movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> without indicating any excellence; whereas "understanding" denotes a certain excellence of a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that penetrates into the heart of things. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is called after the understanding rather than after the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the gift of understanding is compatible with faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 15) that "the thing which is understood is bounded by the comprehension of him who understands it." But the thing which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> is not comprehended, according to the word of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> to the Philippians (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse12">3:12</a>): "Not as though I had already comprehended [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'attained'], or were already perfect." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and understanding are incompatible in the same subject.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is understood is seen by the understanding. But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of things that appear not, as stated above (1, 4; 4, 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is incompatible with understanding in the same subject.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, understanding is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than science. But science and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are incompatible in the same subject, as stated above (1, A4,5). Much less, therefore, can understanding and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be in the same subject.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. i, 15) that "understanding enlightens the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> concerning the things it has heard." Now one who has <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be enlightened in his mind concerning what he has heard; thus it is written (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse27">Luke 24:27-32</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> opened the scriptures to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that they might understand them. Therefore understanding is compatible with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We need to make a twofold distinction here: one on the side of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the other on the part of understanding.

<p>On the side of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the distinction to be made is that certain things, of themselves, come directly under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> to three Persons in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the incarnation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Son; whereas other things come under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, through being subordinate, in one way or another, to those just mentioned, for instance, all that is contained in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>.

<p>On the part of understanding the distinction to be observed is that there are two ways in which we may be said to understand. On one way, we understand a thing perfectly, when we arrive at <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the thing we understand, and the very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> considered in itself of the proposition understood. On this way, so long as the state of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> lasts, we cannot understand those things which are the direct object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: although certain other things that are subordinate to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be understood even in this way.

<p>In another way we understand a thing imperfectly, when the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing or the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of a proposition is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as to its quiddity or mode of being, and yet we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that whatever be the outward appearances, they do not contradict the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in so far as we understand that we ought not to depart from matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for the sake of things that appear externally. On this way, even during the state of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nothing hinders us from understanding even those things which are the direct object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections: for the first three argue in reference to perfect understanding, while the last refers to the understanding of matters subordinate to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the gift of understanding is merely speculative or also practical?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that understanding, considered as a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is not practical, but only speculative. For, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. i, 32), "understanding penetrates certain more exalted things." But the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is occupied, not with exalted, but with inferior things, viz. singulars, about which actions are concerned. Therefore understanding, considered as a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, is not practical.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is something more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of understanding. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of understanding is concerned with none but <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 6). Much more, therefore, is the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding concerned with none but <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> matters. Now the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not about <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things, but about things which may be otherwise than they are, and which may result from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> activity. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is not practical.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding enlightens the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in matters which surpass <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> activities, with which the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is concerned, do not surpass <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which is the directing principle in matters of action, as was made clear above (I-II, 58, 2; I-II, 71, 6). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is not practical.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse10">Psalm 110:10</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> understanding to all that do it."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is not only about those things which come under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> first and principally, but also about all things subordinate to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions have a certain relationship to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: since "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> worketh through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians 5:6</a>). Hence the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding extends also to certain actions, not as though these were its principal object, but in so far as the rule of our actions is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, to which the higher reason, which is perfected by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding, adheres by contemplating and consulting it, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Trin. xii, 7).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The things with which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are concerned are not surpassingly exalted considered in themselves, but, as referred to the rule of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and to the end of Divine <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, they are exalted so that they can be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of understanding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The excellence of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding consists precisely in its considering <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> matters, not only as they are rules of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, because a cognitive <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the more excellent, according to the greater extent of its object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The rule of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (I-II, 71, 6). Now the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> surpasses <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: so that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, as ruled by the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, surpasses the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and requires the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> light of a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the gift of understanding is in all who are in a state of grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is not in all who are in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii, 49) that "the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is given as a remedy against dulness of mind." Now many who are in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a> suffer from dulness of mind. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is not in all who are in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, of all the things that are connected with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone seems to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, since by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> dwells in our hearts, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians 3:17</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is not in everyone that has <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; indeed, those who have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that they may understand, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 27). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: and, consequently, is not in all who are in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, those things which are common to all who are in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, are never withdrawn from them. Now the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of understanding and of the other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> sometimes withdraws itself profitably, for, at times, "when the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is puffed up with understanding sublime things, it becomes sluggish and dull in base and vile things," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> observes (Moral. ii, 49). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is not in all who are in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa081.htm#verse5">Psalm 81:5</a>): "They have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> or understood, they walk on in darkness." But no one who is in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a> walks in darkness, according to <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse12">John 8:12</a>: "He that followeth Me, walketh not in darkness." Therefore no one who is in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a> is without the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In all who are in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, there must needs be rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> prepares <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Julian. Pelag. iv, 3). Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be rightly directed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, unless there be already some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> understood, as stated in De Anima iii, 7. Again, just as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so as to move it directly to some <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; so also, by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding, He enlightens the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, so that it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> some <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to which the right will needs to tend.

<p>Therefore, just as the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is in all of those who have <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, so also is the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some who have <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> may suffer dulness of mind with regard to things that are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; but with regard to those that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, they are sufficiently instructed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse27">1 John 2:27</a>: "His unction teacheth you of all things."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although not all who have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> understand fully the things that are proposed to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, yet they understand that they ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, and that they ought nowise to deviate from them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> With regard to things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding never withdraws from <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: but, in order that they may have no incentive to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, it does withdraw sometimes with regard to other things, so that their mind is unable to penetrate all things clearly.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the gift of understanding is found also in those who have not sanctifying grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is found also in those who have not <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, in expounding the words of <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse20">Psalm 118:20</a>: "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hath <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> to long for Thy justifications," says: "Understanding flies ahead, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is weak and slow to follow." But in all who have <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is prompt on account of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding can be in those who have not <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse1">Daniel 10:1</a>) that "there is need of understanding in a" <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> "vision," so that, seemingly, there is no <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> without the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding. But there can be <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, as evidenced by <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse22">Matthew 7:22</a>, where those who say: "We have <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a> in Thy name [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Have we not <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a> in Thy name?]," are answered with the words: "I never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding can be without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding responds to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse9">Isaiah 7:9</a>, following another reading [the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>]: "If you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you shall not understand." Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding can be without it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse45">John 6:45</a>): "Every one that hath heard of the Father, and hath learned, cometh to Me." Now it is by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> observes (Moral. i, 32), that we learn or understand what we hear. Therefore whoever has the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding, cometh to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is impossible without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding cannot be without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 68, 1,2) the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> perfect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according as it is amenable to the motion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Accordingly then, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is called the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding, in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> understanding is easily moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the consideration of which movement depends on a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> apprehension of the end. Wherefore unless the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> be moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> so far as to have a right estimate of the end, it has not yet obtained the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding, however much the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> may have enlightened it in regard to other <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> that are preambles to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>Now to have a right estimate about the last end one must not be in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about the end, and must adhere to it firmly as to the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and no one can do this without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>; even as in moral matters a man has a right estimate about the end through a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore no one has the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By understanding <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> means any kind of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light, that, however, does not fulfil all the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, unless the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be so far perfected as to have a right estimate about the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The understanding that is requisite for <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, is a kind of enlightenment of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> with regard to the things revealed to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: but it is not an enlightenment of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> with regard to a right estimate about the last end, which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> implies merely assent to what is proposed but understanding implies a certain perception of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which perception, except in one who has <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, cannot regard the end, as stated above. Hence the comparison fails between understanding and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the gift of understanding is distinct from the other gifts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is not distinct from the other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. For there is no distinction between things whose opposites are not distinct. Now "wisdom is contrary to folly, understanding is contrary to dulness, counsel is contrary to rashness, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states (Moral. ii, 49).

<p>But there would seem to be no difference between folly, dulness, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and rashness. Therefore neither does understanding differ from the other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of understanding differs from the other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in that it is proper to it to be about self-evident principles. But the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is not about any self-evident principles, since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of first principles suffices in respect of those matters which are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> self-evident: while <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is sufficient in respect of such things as are <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> are like first principles in <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as stated above (Question 1, Article 7). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding does not differ from the other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is either speculative or practical. Now the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is related to both, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore it is not distinct from the other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, but comprises them all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> When several things are enumerated together they must be, in some way, distinct from one another, because distinction is the origin of number. Now the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is enumerated together with the other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is distinct from the other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The difference between the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding and three of the others, viz. piety, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and fear, is evident, since the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding belongs to the cognitive power, while the three belong to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power.

<p>But the difference between this <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding and the remaining three, viz. wisdom, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and counsel, which also belong to the cognitive power, is not so evident. To some [William of Auxerre, Sum. Aur. III, iii, 8, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding differs from the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and counsel, in that these two belong to practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding belongs to speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and that it differs from the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom, which also belongs to speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in that wisdom is concerned with judgment, while understanding renders the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> apt to grasp the things that are proposed, and to penetrate into their very heart. And in this sense we have assigned the number of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, above (I-II, 68, 4).

<p>But if we consider the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> carefully, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is concerned not only with speculative, but also with practical matters, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), and likewise, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> regards both matters, as we shall show further on (9, 3), and consequently, we must take their distinction in some other way. For all these four <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are ordained to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which, in us, takes its foundation from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is through hearing" (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse17">Romans 10:17</a>). Hence some things must be proposed to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not as seen, but as heard, to which he assents by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, first and principally, is about the First Truth, secondarily, about certain considerations concerning creatures, and furthermore extends to the direction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, in so far as it works through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as appears from what has been said above (4, 2, ad 3).

<p>Accordingly on the part of the things proposed to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, two things are requisite on our part: first that they be penetrated or grasped by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding. Secondly, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should judge these things aright, that he should esteem that he ought to adhere to these things, and to withdraw from their opposites: and this judgment, with regard to Divine things belong to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom, but with regard to <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and as to its application to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> actions, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The foregoing difference between those four <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> is clearly in agreement with the distinction of those things which <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> assigns as their opposites. For dulness is contrary to sharpness, since an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is said, by comparison, to be sharp, when it is able to penetrate into the heart of the things that are proposed to it. Hence it is dulness of mind that renders the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> unable to pierce into the heart of a thing. A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be a fool if he judges wrongly about the common end of life, wherefore folly is properly opposed to wisdom, which makes us judge aright about the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> implies a defect in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, even about any particular things whatever, so that it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which gives <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a right judgment about particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, viz. about creatures. Rashness is clearly opposed to counsel, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not proceed to action before deliberating with his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is about the first principles of that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is conferred by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but otherwise than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because it belongs to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to assent to them, while it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding to pierce with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> the things that are said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is related to both kinds of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, viz. speculative and practical, not as to the judgment, but as to apprehension, by grasping what is said.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the sixth beatitude, "Blessed are the clean of heart," etc., responds to the gift of understanding?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the sixth beatitude, "Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," does not respond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding. Because cleanness of heart seems to belong chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding belongs, not to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but rather to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power. Therefore the aforesaid beatitude does not respond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse9">Acts 15:9</a>): "Purifying their hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Now cleanness of heart is acquired by the heart being purified. Therefore the aforesaid beatitude is related to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rather than to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the present state of life. But the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not belong to the present life, since it is that which gives <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to the Blessed, as stated above (I-II, 3, 8). Therefore the sixth beatitude which comprises the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not respond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4): "The sixth work of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is understanding, is applicable to the clean of heart, whose eye being purified, they can see what eye hath not seen."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things are contained in the sixth beatitude, as also in the others, one by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, viz. cleanness of heart; the other by way of reward, viz. the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (I-II, 69, 2,4), and each of these, in some way, responds to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding.

<p>For cleanness is twofold. One is a preamble and a disposition to seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and consists in the heart being cleansed of inordinate affections: and this cleanness of heart is effected by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> belonging to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. The other cleanness of heart is a kind of complement to the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; such is the cleanness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that is purged of phantasms and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, so as to receive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which are proposed to it about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no longer by way of corporeal phantasms, nor infected with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> misrepresentations: and this cleanness is the result of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding.

<p>Again, the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is twofold. One is perfect, whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Essence is seen: the other is imperfect, whereby, though we see not what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is, yet we see what He is not; and whereby, the more perfectly do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this life, the more we understand that He surpasses all that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> comprehends. Each of these <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding; the first, to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding in its state of perfection, as possessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; the second, to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding in its state of inchoation, as possessed by wayfarers.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections: for the first two arguments refer to the first kind of cleanness; while the third refers to the perfect <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> both perfect us in this life by way of inchoation, and will be fulfilled, as stated above (I-II, 69, 2).

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether faith, among the fruits, responds to the gift of understanding?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that, among the fruits, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not respond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding. For understanding is the fruit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since it is written (<a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse9">Isaiah 7:9</a>) according to another reading [the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>]: "If you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you shall not understand," where our version has: "If you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, you shall not continue." Therefore fruit is not the fruit of understanding.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which precedes is not the fruit of what follows.

<p>But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> seems to precede understanding, since it is the foundation of the entire <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> edifice, as stated above (4, 1,7). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not the fruit of understanding.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, more <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> pertain to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> than to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now, among the fruits, only one pertains to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; namely, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, while all the others pertain to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, seemingly, does not pertain to understanding more than to wisdom, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or counsel.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The end of a thing is its fruit. Now the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding seems to be ordained chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> is reckoned a fruit. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians 5:22</a> says that the "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is a fruit, is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> about the unseen." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, among the fruits, responds to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as stated above (I-II, 70, 1), when we were discussing them, are so called because they are something ultimate and delightful, produced in us by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Now the ultimate and delightful has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an end, which is the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: and consequently that which is ultimate and delightful with regard to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, must be, after a fashion, the fruit of all the other things that pertain to the other powers.

<p>Accordingly, therefore, to this kind of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that perfects a power, we may distinguish a double fruit: one, belonging to the same power; the other, the last of all as it were, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. On this way we must conclude that the fruit which properly responds to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; while the fruit that responds to it last of all is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Understanding is the fruit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, taken as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But we are not taking <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in this sense here, but for a kind of <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attains by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> cannot altogether precede understanding, for it would be impossible to assent by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> what is proposed to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, without understanding it in some way. However, the perfection of understanding follows the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: which perfection of understanding is itself followed by a kind of <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fruit of practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> cannot consist in that very <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, since <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that kind is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> not for its own sake, but for the sake of something else. On the other hand, speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has its fruit in its very self, which fruit is the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> about the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel, which belongs only to practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, has no corresponding fruit of its own: while the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of wisdom, understanding and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which can belongs also to speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, have but one corresponding fruit, which is certainly denoted by the name of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The reason why there are several fruits pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty, is because, as already stated, the character of end, which the word fruit implies, pertains to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> rather than to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part.
