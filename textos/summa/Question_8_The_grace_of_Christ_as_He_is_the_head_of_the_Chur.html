<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ is the Head of the Church?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it does not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For the head imparts sense and motion to the members. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense and motion which are by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, are not imparted to us by the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 12; xv, 24), "not even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but only as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, bestows the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore it does not belong to Him as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is not fitting for the head to have a head. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Head of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>, "The Head of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself is not a head.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Furthermore, the head of a man is a particular member, receiving an influx from the heart. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the universal principle of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore He is not the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse22">Ephesians 1:22</a>): "And He . . . hath made Him head over all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is termed one <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystic body</a> from its likeness to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body of a man, which in divers members has divers acts, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> teaches (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm">Romans 12</a>; <a href="../bible/1co012.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>), so likewise <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from a likeness with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> head, in which we may consider three things, viz. order, perfection, and power: "Order," indeed; for the head is the first part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, beginning from the higher part; and hence it is that every principle is usually called a head according to <a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse25">Ezekiel 16:25</a>: "At every head of the way, thou hast set up a sign of thy prostitution"--"Perfection," inasmuch as in the head dwell all the senses, both interior and exterior, whereas in the other members there is only touch, and hence it is said (<a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse15">Isaiah 9:15</a>): "The aged and honorable, he is the head"--"Power," because the power and movement of the other members, together with the direction of them in their acts, is from the head, by reason of the sensitive and motive power there ruling; hence the ruler is called the head of a people, according to <a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#verse17">1 Samuel 15:17</a>: "When thou wast a little one in thy own eyes, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?" Now these three things belong spiritually to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. First, on account of His nearness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the highest and first, though not in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, since all have received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on account of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>: "For whom He foreknew, He also <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be made conformable to the image of His Son; that He might be the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> amongst many brethren." Secondly, He had perfection as regards the fulness of all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>, "We saw Him [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>'] . . . full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," as was shown, 7, 9]. Thirdly, He has the power of bestowing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on all the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>: "Of His fulness we have all received." And thus it is plain that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is fittingly called the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, authoritatively; but instrumentally it belongs also to Him as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inasmuch as His manhood is the instrument of His Godhead. And hence by the power of the Godhead His actions were beneficial, i.e. by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in us, both meritoriously and efficiently. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> denies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gives the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> authoritatively. Even other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are said to give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> instrumentally, or ministerially, according to <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse5">Galatians 3:5</a>: "He . . . who giveth to you the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In metaphorical speech we must not expect a likeness in all respects; for thus there would be not likeness but identity. Accordingly a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> head has not another head because one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is not part of another; but a metaphorical body, i.e. an ordered multitude, is part of another multitude as the domestic multitude is part of the civil multitude; and hence the father who is head of the domestic multitude has a head above him, i.e. the civil governor. And hence there is no reason why <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should not be the Head of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself is Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The head has a manifest pre-eminence over the other exterior members; but the heart has a certain hidden influence. And hence the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is likened to the heart, since He invisibly quickens and unifies the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is likened to the Head in His visible <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is set over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ is the Head of men as to their bodies or only as to their souls?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the Head of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as to their bodies. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> inasmuch as He bestows <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense and the movement of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But a body is not capable of this <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense and movement. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the Head of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as regards their bodies.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we share bodies with the brutes. If therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was the Head of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as to their bodies, it would follow that He was the Head of brute animals; and this is not fitting.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> took His body from other men, as is clear from <a href="../bible/mat001.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="../bible/luk003.htm">Luke 3</a>. But the head is the first of the members, as was said above (1, ad 3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as regards bodies.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a>): "Who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> relation to the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is its proper form and motor. Inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, it receives from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> life and the other properties which belong specifically to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; but inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is its motor, the body serves the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> instrumentally. Therefore we must hold that the manhood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the power of "influence," inasmuch as it is united to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, to Whom His body is united through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (Question 6, Article 1). Hence the whole manhood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, i.e. according to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, influences all, both in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; but principally the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and secondarily the body: First, inasmuch as the "members of the body are presented as instruments of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that lives through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse13">Romans 6:13</a>): secondly, inasmuch as the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> flows from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on to the body, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans 8:11</a>: "He that raised up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of His Spirit that dwelleth in you."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not reach to the body first and principally, but secondarily and instrumentally, as was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The body of an animal has no relation to a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body has. Hence there is no parity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> drew the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of His body from other men, yet all draw from Him the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life of their body, according to <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse22">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>: "And as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, so also in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> all shall be made alive."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ is the Head of all men?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the Head of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For the head has no relation except to the members of its body. Now the unbaptized are nowise members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as it is written (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse23">Ephesians 1:23</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the Head of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> writes to the Ephesians (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">5:25-27</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> delivered Himself up for" the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> "that He might present it to Himself a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing." But there are many of the faithful in whom is found the spot or the wrinkle of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the Head of all the faithful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> are compared to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as the shadow to the body, as is written (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse17">Colossians 2:17</a>). But the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> in their day served unto these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb008.htm#verse5">Hebrews 8:5</a>: "Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things." Hence they did not pertain to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, and therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the Head of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse10">1 Timothy 4:10</a>): "Who is the Saviour of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, especially of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>," and (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse2">1 John 2:2</a>): "He is the propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world." Now to save men and to be a propitiation for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Head. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Head of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This is the difference between the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Church's mystical body</a>, that the members of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body are all together, and the members of the mystical are not all together--neither as regards their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being, since the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is made up of the men who have been from the beginning of the world until its end--nor as regards their <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> being, since, of those who are at any one time, some there are who are without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, yet will afterwards obtain it, and some have it already. We must therefore consider the members of the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a> not only as they are in act, but as they are in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Nevertheless, some are in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> who will never be reduced to act, and some are reduced at some time to act; and this according to the triple class, of which the first is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the second by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of this life, the third by the fruition of the life to come. Hence we must say that if we take the whole time of the world in general, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Head of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but diversely. For, first and principally, He is the Head of such as are united to Him by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; secondly, of those who are actually united to Him by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; thirdly, of those who are actually united to Him by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; fourthly, of those who are united to Him merely in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, which is not yet reduced to act, yet will be reduced to act according to Divine <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>; fifthly, of those who are united to Him in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, which will never be reduced to act; such are those men <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the world, who are not predestined, who, however, on their departure from this world, wholly cease to be members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as being no longer in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to be united to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those who are unbaptized, though not actually in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. And this <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is rooted in two things--first and principally, in the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is sufficient for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; secondly, in <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To be "a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Church not having spot or wrinkle" is the ultimate end to which we are brought by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>. Hence this will be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and not on earth, in which "if we say we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves," as is written (<a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1 John 1:8</a>). Nevertheless, there are some, viz. mortal, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from which they are free who are members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by the actual union of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; but such as are tainted with these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> actually, but <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>; except, perhaps, imperfectly, by formless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which unites to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, relatively but not simply, viz. so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> partake of the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For, as is written (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse20">James 2:20</a>): "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> without works is dead." Yet such as these receive from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a certain vital act, i.e. to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, as if a lifeless limb were moved by a man to some extent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers made use of the legal <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, not as realities, but as images and shadows of what was to come. Now it is the same motion to an image as image, and to the reality, as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Memor. et Remin. ii). Hence the ancient Fathers, by observing the legal <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, were borne to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and love whereby we also are borne to Him, and hence the ancient Fathers belong to the same Church as we.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ is the Head of the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not the head of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For the head and members are of one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but only with men, since, as is written (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse16">Hebrews 2:16</a>): "For nowhere doth He take hold of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> He taketh hold." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not the head of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the head of such as belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is His Body, as is written (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse23">Ephesians 1:23</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the congregation of the faithful: and in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for they do not "walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" but "by sight," otherwise they would be "absent from the Lord," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> argues (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 5:6-7</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not head of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xix; xxiii in Joan.), that as "the Word" which "was in the beginning with the Father" quickens <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, so the "Word made flesh" quickens bodies, which <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> lack. But the Word made flesh is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not give life to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and hence as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> He is not the head of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse10">Colossians 2:10</a>), "Who is the head of all Principality and Power," and the same reason holds good with the other orders of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (1, ad 2), where there is one body we must allow that there is one head. Now a multitude ordained to one end, with distinct acts and duties, may be metaphorically called one body. But it is manifest that both men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are ordained to one end, which is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Divine fruition. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body of the Church</a> consists not only of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> but of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Now of all this multitude <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Head, since He is nearer <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and shares His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> more fully, not only than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but even than <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and of His influence not only men but even <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> partake, since it is written (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse20">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>): that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father set "Him," namely <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "on His right hand in the heavenly places, above all Principality and Power and Virtue and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this world, but also in that which is to come. And He hath subjected all things under His feet." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not only the Head of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Hence we read (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse11">Matthew 4:11</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> came and ministered to Him."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> influence over men is chiefly with regard to their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; wherein men agree with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, though not in specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. By reason of this agreement <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> can be said to be the Head of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, although the agreement falls short as regards the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Church, on earth, is the congregation of the faithful; but, in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, it is the congregation of comprehensors. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not merely a wayfarer, but a comprehensor. And therefore He is the Head not merely of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but of comprehensors, as having <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> most fully.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> here uses the similitude of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect, i.e. inasmuch as corporeal things act on bodies, and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things on <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. Nevertheless, the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, i.e. the Divine, can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> something not only in the spirits of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but also in the spirits of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, on account of its most close conjunction with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, i.e. by personal union.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the grace of Christ, as Head of the Church, is the same as His habitual grace, inasmuch as He is Man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Man are not the same. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse15">Romans 5:15</a>): "If by the offense of one many died, much more the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, hath abounded unto many." But the actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is distinct from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> which he transmitted to his posterity. Hence the personal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is distinct from His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, inasmuch as He is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which flows to others from Him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are distinguished by acts. But the personal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is ordained to one act, viz. the sanctification of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and the capital <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is ordained to another, viz. to sanctifying others. Therefore the personal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is distinct from His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as He is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as was said above (Question 6, Article 6), in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> we distinguish a threefold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, viz. the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union, capital <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Man. Now the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union. Therefore it is also distinct from the capital <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>): "Of His fulness we all have received." Now He is our Head, inasmuch as we receive from Him. Therefore He is our Head, inasmuch as He has the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now He had the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, inasmuch as personal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was in Him in its perfection, as was said above (Question 7, Article 9). Hence His capital and personal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are not distinct.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since everything acts inasmuch as it is a being in act, it must be the same act whereby it is in act and whereby it acts, as it is the same heat whereby fire is hot and whereby it heats. Yet not every act whereby anything is in act suffices for its being the principle of acting upon others. For since the agent is nobler than the patient, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16) and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, 19), the agent must act on others by reason of a certain pre-eminence. Now it was said above (1; 7, 9) <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was received by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the highest way; and therefore from this pre-eminence of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which He received, it is from Him that this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is bestowed on others--and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of head. Hence the personal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is justified, is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same as His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as He is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and justifies others; but there is a distinction of reason between them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is derived from his actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is a personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because in him the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> corrupted the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and by means of this corruption the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is transmitted to posterity, inasmuch as the corrupt <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> corrupts the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not vouchsafed us by means of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but solely by the personal action of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. Hence we must not distinguish a twofold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, one corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the other to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> we distinguish the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Different acts, one of which is the reason and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the other, do not diversify a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now the act of the personal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is formally to sanctify its subject, is the reason of the justification of others, which pertains to capital <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence it is that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not diversified by this difference.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Personal and capital <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are ordained to an act; but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union is not ordained to an act, but to the personal being. Hence the personal and the capital <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> agree in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union does not, although the personal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can be called in a manner the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union, inasmuch as it brings about a fitness for the union; and thus the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union, the capital, and the personal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are one in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, though there is a distinction of reason between them.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it is proper to Christ to be Head of the Church?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#verse17">1 Samuel 15:17</a>): "When thou wast a little one in thy own eyes, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?" Now there is but one Church in the New and the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Therefore it seems that with equal reason any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> might be head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from His bestowing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> members. But it belongs to others also to grant <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to others, according to <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse29">Ephesians 4:29</a>: "Let no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speech proceed from your mouth; but that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the edification of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that it may administer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the hearers." Therefore it seems to belong also to others than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by His ruling over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not only called "Head," but also "Shepherd" and "Foundation." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not retain for Himself alone the name of Shepherd, according to <a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse4">1 Peter 5:4</a>, "And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a never-fading crown of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>"; nor the name of Foundation, according to <a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse14">Apocalypse 21:14</a>: "And the wall of the city had twelve foundations." Therefore it seems that He did not retain the name of Head for Himself alone.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse19">Colossians 2:19</a>): "The head" of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is that "from which the whole body, by joints and bands being supplied with nourishment and compacted groweth unto the increase of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But this belongs only to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone is Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The head influences the other members in two ways. First, by a certain intrinsic influence, inasmuch as motive and sensitive force flow from the head to the other members; secondly, by a certain exterior guidance, inasmuch as by sight and the senses, which are rooted in the head, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is guided in his exterior acts. Now the interior influx of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is from no one save Christ, Whose manhood, through its union with the Godhead, has the power of justifying; but the influence over the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as regards their exterior guidance, can belong to others; and in this way others may be called heads of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to <a href="../bible/amo006.htm#verse1">Amos 6:1</a>, "Ye great men, heads of the people"; differently, however, from Christ. First, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Head of all who pertain to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in every place and time and state; but all other men are called heads with reference to certain special places, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of their Churches. Or with reference to a determined time as the Pope is the head of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, viz. during the time of his Pontificate, and with reference to a determined state, inasmuch as they are in the state of wayfarers. Secondly, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by His own power and authority; while others are called heads, as taking <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> place, according to <a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 2:10</a>, "For what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything, for your sakes I have done it in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," and <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse20">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>, "For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> therefore we are ambassadors, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as it were, exhorting by us."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The word "head" is employed in that passage in regard to exterior government; as a king is said to be the head of his kingdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Man does not distribute <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by interior influx, but by exteriorly persuading to the effects of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xlvi in Joan.): "If the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are Shepherds, how is there one Shepherd, except that all these are members of one Shepherd?" So likewise others may be called foundations and heads, inasmuch as they are members of the one Head and Foundation. Nevertheless, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xlvii), "He gave to His members to be shepherds; yet none of us calleth himself the Door. He kept this for Himself alone." And this because by door is implied the principal authority, inasmuch as it is by the door that all enter the house; and it is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone by "Whom also we have access . . . into this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, wherein we stand" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse2">Romans 5:2</a>); but by the other names above-mentioned there may be implied not merely the principal but also the secondary authority.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the devil is the head of all the wicked?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is not the head of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For it belongs to the head to diffuse sense and movement into the members, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says, on <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse22">Ephesians 1:22</a>, "And made Him head," etc. But the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has no power of spreading the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the sinner. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> cannot be called the head of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> a man is made <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But not every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and this is plain as regards the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through the persuasion of another; so likewise not every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, for it is said (De Eccles. Dogm. lxxxii): "Not all our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thoughts are always raised up by the suggestion of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; but sometimes they spring from the movement of our will." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is not the head of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one head is placed on one body. But the whole multitude of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> do not seem to have anything in which they are united, for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and springs from divers defects, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> cannot be called the head of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, Moral. xiv] on <a href="../bible/job018.htm#verse17">Job 18:17</a>, "Let the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of him perish from the earth," says: "This is said of every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one, yet so as to be referred to the head," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>), the head not only influences the members interiorly, but also governs them exteriorly, directing their actions to an end. Hence it may be said that anyone is the head of a multitude, either as regards both, i.e. by interior influence and exterior governance, and thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as was stated (6); or as regards exterior governance, and thus every prince or prelate is head of the multitude subject to him. And in this way the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is head of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For, as is written (<a href="../bible/job041.htm#verse25">Job 41:25</a>): "He is king over all the children of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>." Now it belongs to a governor to lead those whom he governs to their end. But the end of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the aversion of the rational creature from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; hence from the beginning he has endeavored to lead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from obeying the Divine precept. But aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an end, inasmuch as it is sought for under the appearance of liberty, according to <a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse20">Jeremiah 2:20</a>: "Of old time thou hast broken my yoke, thou hast burst my bands, and thou saidst, 'I will not serve.'" Hence, inasmuch as some are brought to this end by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, they fall under the rule and government of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and therefore he is called their head.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> does not influence the rational mind interiorly, yet he beguiles it to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by persuasion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A governor does not always suggest to his subjects to obey his will; but proposes to all the sign of his will, in consequence of which some are incited by inducement, and some of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, as is plain in the leader of an army, whose standard all the soldiers follow, though no one persuades them. Therefore in the same way, the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a> from the beginning" (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse8">1 John 3:8</a>), is held out to all to be followed, and some imitate at his suggestion, and some of their own will without any suggestion. And hence the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the head of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, inasmuch as they imitate Him, according to <a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse24">Wisdom 2:24-25</a>: "By the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, death came into the world. And they follow him that are of his side."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> agree in aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although they differ by conversion to different changeable goods.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether Anti-christ may be called the head of all the wicked?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a> is not the head of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For there are not several heads of one body. But the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the head of the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a> is not their head.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a> is a member of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Now the head is distinguished from the members. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a> is not the head of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the head has an influence over the members. But <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a> has no influence over the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> who have preceded him. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a> is not the head of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, Moral. xv] on <a href="../bible/job021.htm#verse29">Job 21:29</a>, "Ask any of them that go by the way," says: "Whilst he was speaking of the body of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, suddenly he turned his speech to <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a> the head of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>-doers."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), in the head are found three things: order, perfection, and the power of influencing. But as regards the order of the body, <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a> is not said to be the head of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> as if his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had preceded, as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> preceded. So likewise he is not called the head of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> from the power of influencing, although he will pervert some in his day by exterior persuasion; nevertheless those who were before him were not beguiled into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> by him nor have imitated his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Hence he cannot be called the head of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in this way, but of some. Therefore it remains to be said that he is the head of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> by reason of the perfection of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Hence, on <a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse4">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>, "Showing himself as if he were <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "As in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> dwelt the fulness of the Godhead, so in <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a> the fulness of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>." Not indeed as if his humanity were assumed by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> into unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; but that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by suggestion infuses his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> more copiously into him than into all others. And in this way all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> who have gone before are signs of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>, "For the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> already worketh."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a> are not two heads, but one; since <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a> is called the head, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is most fully impressed on him. Hence, on <a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse4">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>, "Showing himself as if he were <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "The head of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, namely the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who is king over all the children of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> will be in him." Now he is said to be in him not by personal union, nor by indwelling, since "the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> alone dwells in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>" (as is said De Eccles. Dogm. lxxxiii), but by the effect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the head of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet He is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as was said above (1, ad 2), so likewise <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a> is a member of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and yet is head of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a> is said to be the head of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> not by a likeness of influence, but by a likeness of perfection. For in him the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as it were, brings his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> to a head, in the same way that anyone is said to bring his purpose to a head when he executes it.
