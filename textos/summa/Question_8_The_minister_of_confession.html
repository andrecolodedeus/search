<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is necessary to confess to a priest?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to confess to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. For we are not bound to confession, except in virtue of its Divine institution. Now its Divine institution is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse16">James 5:16</a>): "Confess your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, one to another," where there is no mention of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to confess to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Penance is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sacrament, as is also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the minister of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, on account of its <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Therefore any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the minister of Penance. Now confession should be made to the minister of Penance. Therefore it suffices to confess to anyone.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, confession is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order that the measure of satisfaction should be imposed on the penitent. Now, sometimes another than a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> might be more discreet than many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are in imposing the measure of satisfaction on the penitent. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to confess to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, confession was instituted in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in order that the rectors might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their sheep by sight. But sometimes a rector or prelate is not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Therefore confession should not always be made to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> of the penitent, for the sake of which he makes his confession, is imparted by none but <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to whom the keys are intrusted. Therefore confession should be made to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p>Further, confession is foreshadowed in the raising of the dead <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> to life. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> commanded none but the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to loose <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse44">John 11:44</a>). Therefore confession should be made to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is given in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, descends from the Head to the members. Wherefore he alone who exercises a ministry over <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body is a minister of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, wherein <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given; and this belongs to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone, who can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, none but a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is the minister of the sacrament: and consequently sacramental confession which should be made to a minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, should be made to none but a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> James speaks on the presupposition of the Divine institutions: and since confession had already been prescribed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be made to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in that He empowered them, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as related in <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John 20:23</a>, we must take the words of James as conveying an admonishment to confess to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of greater <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> than Penance, as regards confession and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, because sometimes <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> cannot be omitted without loss of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as in the case of children who have not come to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: whereas this cannot be said of confession and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, which regard none but adults, in whom <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, together with the purpose of confessing and the desire of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, suffices to deliver them from everlasting death. Consequently there is no parity between <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and confession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In satisfaction we must consider not only the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the punishment but also its power, inasmuch as it is part of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. In this way it requires a dispenser of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, though the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the punishment may be fixed by another than a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for two reasons to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the sheep by sight. First, in order to register them as members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flock, and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the sheep by sight thus belongs to the pastoral charge and care, which is sometimes the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of those who are not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Secondly, that they may be provided with suitable remedies for their health; and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the sheep by sight thus belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, whose business it is to provide remedies conducive to health, such as the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, and other like things. It is to this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the sheep that confession is ordained.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is ever lawful to confess to another than a priest?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is never lawful to confess to another than a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. For confession is a sacramental accusation, as appears from the definition given above (Question 7, Article 1). But the dispensing of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> belongs to none but the minister of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Since then the proper minister of Penance is a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, it seems that confession should be made to no one else.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in every court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> confession is ordained to the sentence. Now in a disputed case the sentence is void if pronounced by another than the proper judge; so that confession should be made to none but a judge. But, in the court of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, the judge is none but a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who has the power of binding and loosing. Therefore confession should be made to no one else.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the case of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, since anyone can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> has <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, even without <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should not be repeated by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But if anyone confess to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, he is bound to repeat his confession to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for urgency has passed. Therefore confession should not be made to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> is the authority of the text (Sent. iv, D, 17).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sacrament, so is Penance. And <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, through being a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sacrament has a twofold minister: one whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, in virtue of his office, viz. the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and another, to whom the conferring of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is committed, in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. In like manner the minister of Penance, to whom, in virtue of his office, confession should be made, is a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; but in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> even a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> may take the place of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and hear a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> confession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> there is not only something on the part of the minister, viz. the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and imposition of satisfaction, but also something on the part of the recipient, which is also <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> and confession. Now satisfaction originates from the minister in so far as he enjoins it, and from the penitent who fulfills it; and, for the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, both these things should concur when possible. But when there is reason for urgency, the penitent should fulfill his own part, by being <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> and confessing to whom he can; and although this <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot perfect the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, so as to fulfill the part of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by giving <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, yet this defect is supplied by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High Priest</a>. Nevertheless confession made to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, through lack* of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, is quasi-sacramental, although it is not a perfect sacrament, on account of the absence of the part which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. [Here and in the Reply to Objection 2 the Leonine edition reads "through desire for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>".]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> is not the judge of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who confesses to him, yet, on account of the urgency, he does take the place of a judge over him, absolutely speaking, in so far as the penitent submits to him, through lack of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By means of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> must needs be reconciled not only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now he cannot be reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, unless the hallowing of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> reach him. In <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> the hallowing of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> reaches a man through the element itself applied externally, which is sanctified by "the word of life" (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse26">Ephesians 5:26</a>), by whomsoever it is conferred: and so when once a man has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by whom, he must not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again. On the other hand, in Penance the hallowing of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> reaches <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the minister alone, because in that sacrament there is no bodily element applied externally, through the hallowing of which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be conferred. Consequently although the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who, in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, has confessed to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, has received forgiveness from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the reason that he fulfilled, so far as he could, the purpose which he conceived in accordance with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> command, he is not yet reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so as to be admitted to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, unless he first be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, even as he who has received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of desire, is not admitted to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Wherefore he must confess again to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as soon as there is one at hand, and the more so since, as stated above (ad 1), the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> was not perfected, and so it needs yet to be perfected, in order that by receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, the penitent may receive a more plentiful effect, and that he may fulfill the commandment about receiving the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether, outside a case of necessity, anyone who is not a priest may hear the confession of venial sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that, outside a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, no one but a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may hear the confession of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For the dispensation of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is committed to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> by reason of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. But the confession of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Therefore it is not committed to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is ordained against venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, just as Penance is. But the former may not be given by a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse14">James 5:14</a>. Therefore neither can the confession of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be made to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> is the authority of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> (on <a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse16">James 5:16</a>, "Confess . . . one to another") quoted in the text (Sent. iv, D, 17).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is separated neither from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nor from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: wherefore he does not need to receive any further <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for the forgiveness of such a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor does he need to be reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Consequently a man does not need to confess his venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. And since confession made to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> is a sacramental, although it is not a perfect sacrament, and since it proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, just as the beating of one's breast, or the sprinkling of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> water (cf. III, 87, 3).

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection, because there is no need to receive a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> for the forgiveness of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. and a sacramental, such as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> water or the like, suffices for the purpose.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is not given directly as a remedy for venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor is any other sacrament.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is necessary for one to confess to one's own priest?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is nol <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to confess to one's own priest. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [Cf. Can. Ex auctoritate xvi, 1 says: "By our apostolic authority and in discharge of our solicitude we have decreed that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who as <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> imitate the example of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, may preach, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, give communion, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for sinners, impose penances, and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> are not the proper <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of anyone, since they have not the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Since, therefore confession is made for the sake of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> it suffices for it to be made to any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the minister of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as also of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. But any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can perform the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Therefore any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can administer the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>. Therefore there is no need to confess to one's own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when we are bound to one thing in particular it is not left to our choice. But the choice of a discreet <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is left to us as appears from the authority of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> quoted in the text (Sent. ix, D, 17): for he says in De vera et falsa Poenitentia [Work of an unknown author]: "He who wishes to confess his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in order to find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, must seek a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to loose and to bind." Therefore it seems unnecessary to confess to one's own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, there are some, such as <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, who seem to have no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of their own, since they have no superior: yet they are bound to confession. Therefore a man is not always bound to confess to his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, "That which is instituted for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, does not militate against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> observes (De Praecept. et Dispens. ii). Now confession, which was instituted for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, would militate against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, if a man were bound to confess to any particular <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: e.g. if the sinner <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, or a man of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influence, or weak and prone to the very <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that he wishes to confess to him, or reasonably suspected of breaking the seal of confession, or if the penitent has to confess a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against his confessor. Therefore it seems that one need not always confess to one's own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, men should not be straitened in matters <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, lest they be hindered in the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But it seems a great inconvenience to be bound of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to confess to one particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and many might be hindered from going to confession, through either fear, shame, or something else of the kind. Therefore, since confession is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, men should not be straitened, as apparently they would be, by having to confess to their own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands a decree of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (Can. 21), who appointed "all of either sex to confess once a year to their own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>."

<p>Further, as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to his diocese, so is a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. Now it is unlawful, according to <a href="../cathen/09056a.htm">canon law</a> (Can. Nullus primas ix, 2; Can. Si quis episcoporum xvi, 5), for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to exercise the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office in another diocese. Therefore it is not lawful for one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to hear the confession of another's parishioner.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> do not consist in an action of the recipient, but only in his receiving something, as is evident with regard to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and so forth. though the action of the recipient is required as removing an obstacle, i.e. insincerity, in order that he may receive the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, if he has come to the use of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. On the other hand, the action of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who approaches the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, since <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, confession, and satisfaction, which are acts of the penitent, are parts of Penance. Now our actions, since they have their origin in us, cannot be dispensed by others, except through their command. Hence whoever is appointed a dispenser of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, must be such as to be able to command something to be done. Now a man is not competent to command another unless he have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over him. Consequently it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not only for the minister to be in orders, as in the case of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but also for him to have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>: wherefore he that has no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> cannot administer this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> any more than one who is not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Therefore confession should be made not only to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but to one's own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; for since a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> a man except by binding him to do something, he alone can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a>, who, by his command, can bind the penitent to do something.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> is speaking of those <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, through having charge of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>; about whom some had maintained that from the very fact that they were monks, they could not <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> or impose penance, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> does not require the power of command over a man, whereas this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does, as stated above: and so the argument proves nothing. Nevertheless it is not lawful to receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> from another than one's own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, although it is a real sacrament that one receives from another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The choice of a discreet <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is not left to us in such a way that we can do just as we like; but it is left to the permission of a higher authority, if perchance one's own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> happens to be less suitable for applying a salutary remedy to our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> to dispense the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which the clean alone should handle, they are allowed by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (De Poenit. et Remiss., Cap. Ne pro dilatione) to choose a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for their confessor; who in this respect is the prelate's superior; even as one physician is cured by another, not as a physician but as a patient.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> In those cases wherein the penitent has reason to fear some harm to himself or to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by reason of his confessing to him, he should have recourse to the higher authority, or ask permission of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> himself to confess to another; and if he fails to obtain permission, the case is to be decided as for a man who has no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at hand; so that he should rather choose a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> and confess to him. Nor does he disobey the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by so doing, because the precepts of positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> do not extend beyond the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver, which is the end of the precept, and in this case, is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 1:5</a>). Nor is any slur cast on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, for he deserves to forfeit his privilege, for abusing the power intrusted to him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of confessing to one's own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not straiten the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but determines it sufficiently. A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, however, would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he were not easy in giving permission to confess to another, because many are so weak that they would rather die without confession than confess to such a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Wherefore those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are too anxious to probe the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> of their subjects by means of confession, lay a snare of damnation for many, and consequently for themselves.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether it is lawful for anyone to confess to another than his own priest, in virtue of a privilege or a command given by a superior?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not lawful for anyone to confess to another than his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, even in virtue of a privilege or command given by a superior. For no privilege should be given that wrongs a third party. Now it would be prejudicial to the subject's own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, if he were to confess to another. Therefore this cannot be allowed by a superior's privilege, permission, or command.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which hinders the observance of a Divine command cannot be the subject of a command or privilege given by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now it is a Divine command to the rectors of churches to "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the countenance of their own cattle" (<a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse23">Proverbs 27:23</a>); and this is hindered if another than the rector hear the confession of his subjects. Therefore this cannot be prescribed by any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> privilege or command.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, he that hears another's confession is the latter's own judge, else he could not bind or loose him. Now one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot have several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or judges of his own, for then he would be bound to obey several men, which would be impossible, if their commands were contrary or incompatible. Therefore one may not confess to another than one's own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, even with the superior's permission.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is derogatory to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, or at least useless, to repeat a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> over the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But he who has confessed to another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, is bound to confess again to his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, if the latter requires him to do so, because he is not <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from his obedience, whereby he is bound to him in this respect. Therefore it cannot be lawful for anyone to confess to another than his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> He that can perform the actions of an order can depute the exercise thereof to anyone who has the same order. Now a superior, such as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, can hear the confession of anyone belonging to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, for sometimes he reserves certain cases to himself, since he is the chief rector. Therefore he can also depute another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to hear that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>Further, a superior can do whatever his subject can do. But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> himself can give his parishioner permission to confess to another. Much more, therefore, can his superior do this.

<p>Further, the power which a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has among his people, comes to him from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Now it is through that power that he can hear confessions. Therefore, in like manner, another can do so, to whom the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives the same power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may be hindered in two ways from hearing a man's confession: first, through lack of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; secondly, through being prevented from exercising his order, as those who are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, degraded, and so forth. Now whoever has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, can depute to another whatever comes under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; so that if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is hindered from hearing a man's confession through want of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, anyone who has immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or Pope, can depute that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to hear his confession and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> him. If, on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot hear the confession, on account of an impediment to the exercise of his order, anyone who has the power to remove that impediment can permit him to hear confessions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> No wrong is done to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> unless what is taken away from him was granted for his own benefit. Now the power of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is not granted a man for his own benefit, but for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the people and for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore if the higher <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> deem it expedient for the furthering of the people's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to commit matters of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to others, no wrong is done to the inferior <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, except to those who "seek the things that are their own; not the things that are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ's</a>" (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse21">Philippians 2:21</a>), and who rule their flock, not by feeding it, but by feeding on it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The rector of a church should "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the countenance of his own cattle" in two ways. First, by an assiduous attention to their external conduct, so as to watch over the flock committed to his care: and in acquiring this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he should not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> his subject, but, as far as possible, inquire into the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of facts. Secondly, by the manifestation of confession; and with regard to this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he cannot arrive at any greater <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> than by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> his subject, because this is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that he may help his subject's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Consequently in the tribunal of confession, the penitent is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> whether he speak for himself or against himself, but not in the court of external judgment: wherefore it suffices for this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the penitent when he says that he has confessed to one who could <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> him. It is therefore clear that this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the flock is not hindered by a privilege granted to another to hear confessions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It would be inconvenient, if two men were placed equally over the same people, but there is no inconvenience if over the same people two are placed one of whom is over the other. In this way the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the Pope are placed immediately over the same people, and each of them can commit matters of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to some other. Now a higher superior delegates a man in two ways: first, so that the latter takes the superior's place, as when the Pope or a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> appoints his penitentiaries; and then the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> thus delegated is higher than the inferior prelate, as the Pope's penitentiary is higher than a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> penitentiary than a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the penitent is bound to obey the former rather than the latter. Secondly, so that the delegate is appointed the coadjutor of this other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; and since a co-adjutor is subordinate to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he is appointed to help, he holds a lower rank, and the penitent is not so bound to obey him as his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to confess <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that he has no longer. Consequently, if a man has confessed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> penitentiary, or to someone else having faculties from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven both before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that he is not bound to confess them to his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, however much the latter may insist: but on account of the Ecclesiastical precept (De Poenit. et Remiss., Cap. Omnis utriusque) which prescribes confession to be made once a year to one's own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he is under the same <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> as one who has committed none but venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For such a one, according to some, is bound to confess none but venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or he must declare that he is free from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, ought, and is bound, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him. If, however, he were bound to confess again, his first confession would not be useless, because the more <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> one confesses to, the more is the punishment remitted, both by reason of the shame in confessing, which is reckoned as a satisfactory punishment, and by reason of the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>: so that one might confess so often as to be delivered from all punishment. Nor is repetition derogatory to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, except in those wherein there is some kind of sanctification, either by the impressing of a character, or by the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, neither of which applies to Penance. Hence it would be well for him who hears confessions by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> authority, to advise the penitent to confess to his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, yet he must <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> him, even if he declines to do so.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether a penitent, at the point of death, can be absolved by any priest?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a penitent, at the point of death, cannot be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> by any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> requires <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). Now a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not acquire <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over a man who repents at the point of death. Therefore he cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he that receives the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>, when in danger of death, from another than his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, does not need to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again by the latter. If, therefore, any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a>, from any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a man who is in danger of death, the penitent, if he survive the danger, need not go to his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, since otherwise the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> would not "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the countenance of his cattle."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when there is danger of death, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> can be conferred not only by a strange <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but also by one who is not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But one who is not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can never <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> in the tribunal of Penance. Therefore neither can a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> a man who is not his subject, when he is in danger of death.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Spiritual <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> is greater than bodily <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. But it is lawful in a case of extreme <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, for a man to make use of another's property, even against the owner's will, in order to supply a bodily need. Therefore in danger of death, a man may be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> by another than his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in order to supply his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> need.

<p>Further, the authorities quoted in the text <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the same (Sent. iv, D, 20, Cap. Non Habet).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we consider the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has power over all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> equally and over all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and it is due to the fact that by the ordination of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he has a limited <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> or none at all, that he cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But since "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>" [Cap. Consilium, De observ. jejun.; De reg. jur. (v, <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a>)] in cases of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> the ordination of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not hinder him from being able to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a>, since he has the keys sacramentally: and the penitent will receive as much benefit from the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> of this other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> as if he had been <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> by his own. Moreover a man can then be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> by any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> not only from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but also from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, by whomsoever pronounced, because such <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is also a matter of that <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which by the ordination of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is con. fined within certain limits.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> One <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may act on the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of another according to the latter's will, since matters of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> can be deputed. Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> recognizes <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> granted by any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the hour of death, from this very fact a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has the use of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> though he lack the power of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He needs to go to his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, not that he may be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> again from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, from which he was <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> when in danger of death, but that his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he is <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a>. In like manner, he who has been <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> needs to go to the judge, who in other circumstances could have <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> him, not in order to seek <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, but in order to offer satisfaction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> derives its efficacy from the sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> itself, so that a man receives the sacrament whosoever baptizes him: whereas the sacramental power of Penance consists in a sanctification pronounced by the minister, so that if a man confess to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, although he fulfills his own part of the sacramental confession, he does not receive sacramental <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. Wherefore his confession avails him somewhat, as to the lessening of his punishment, owing to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> derived from his confession and to his repentance. but he does not receive that diminution of his punishment which results from the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>; and consequently he must confess again to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; and one who has confessed thus, is more punished hereafter than if he had confessed to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the temporal punishment is imposed according to the degree of the fault?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the temporal punishment, the debt of which remains after Penance, is not imposed according to the degree of fault. For it is imposed according to the degree of pleasure derived from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/rev018.htm#verse7">Apocalypse 18:7</a>: "As much as she hath glorified herself and lived in delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye her." Yet sometimes where there is greater pleasure, there is less fault, since "carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which afford more pleasure than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, are less guilty," according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxiii, 2). Therefore the punishment is not imposed according to the degree of fault.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> one is bound to punishment for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in the same way as in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Now in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> the punishment for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was due to last seven days, in other words, they had to remain <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> seven days for one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Since therefore, in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, a punishment of seven years is imposed for one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the punishment does not answer to the degree of fault.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> in a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> is more grievous than that of fornication in a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, because the circumstance which is taken from the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is more aggravating than that which is taken from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the sinner. Now a punishment of seven years' duration is appointed for a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> guilty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, while for fornication a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is punished for ten years, according to Can. Presbyter, Dist. lxxxii. Therefore punishment is not imposed according to the degree of fault.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against the very body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is most grievous, because the greater the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against, the more grievous the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now for spilling the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the sacrament of the altar a punishment of forty days or a little more is enjoined, while a punishment of seven years is prescribed for fornication, according to the Canons (Can. Presbyter, Dist. lxxxii). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the punishment does not answer to the degree of fault.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa027.htm#verse8">Isaiah 27:8</a>): "In measure against measure, when it shall be cast off, thou shalt judge it." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of punishment adjudicated for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> answers the degree of fault.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is reduced to the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by the punishment inflicted on him. But this would not be so if the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the fault and of the punishment did not mutually correspond. Therefore one answers to the other.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> After the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a punishment is required for two reasons, viz. to pay the debt, and to afford a remedy. Hence the punishment may be imposed in consideration of two things. First, in consideration of the debt, and in this way the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the punishment corresponds radically to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the fault, before anything of the latter is forgiven: yet the more there is remitted by the first of those things which are of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to remit punishment, the less there remains to be remitted or paid by the other, because the more <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> remits of the punishment, the less there remains to be remitted by confession. Secondly, in consideration of the remedy, either as regards the one who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, or as regards others: and thus sometimes a greater punishment is enjoined for a lesser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; either because one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more difficult to resist than another's (thus a heavier punishment is imposed on a young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for fornication, than on an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, though the former's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be less grievous), or because one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for instance, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a>, is more dangerous to others, than another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or because the people are more prone to that particular <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by the punishment of the one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to deter others. Consequently, in the tribunal of Penance, the punishment has to be imposed with due regard to both these things: and so a greater punishment is not always imposed for a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. on the other hand, the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> is only for the payment of the debt, because there is no longer any possibility of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, so that this punishment is meted only according to the measure of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, with due consideration however for the degree of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, and for confession and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, since all these lessen the punishment somewhat: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in enjoining satisfaction should bear them in mind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the words quoted two things are mentioned with regard to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, viz. "glorification" and "delicacies" or "delectation"; the first of which regards the uplifting of the sinner, whereby he resists <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; while the second regards the pleasure of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and though sometimes there is less pleasure in a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet there is greater uplifting; wherefore the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This punishment of seven days did not expiate the punishment due for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that even if the sinner died after that time, he would be punished in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>: but it was in expiation of the <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> incurred, from which all the legal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> expiated. Nevertheless, other things being equal, a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> than under the Old, on account of the more plentiful sanctification received in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and on account of the more powerful blessings bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. This is evident from <a href="../bible/heb009.htm">Hebrews 9</a>: "How much more, do you think, he deserveth worse punishments," etc. And yet it is not universally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that a seven years' penance is exacted for every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but it is a kind of general rule applicable to the majority of cases, which must, nevertheless, be disregarded, with due consideration for the various circumstances of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and penitents.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with greater danger to others or to himself; wherefore the canons are more anxious to withdraw him from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by inflicting a greater punishment, in as much as it is intended as a remedy; although sometimes so great a punishment is not strictly due. Hence he is punished less in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This punishment refers to the case when this happens against the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> will: for if he spilled it willingly he would deserve a much heavier punishment.
