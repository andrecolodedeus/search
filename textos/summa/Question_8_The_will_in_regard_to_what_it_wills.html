<h1>Question 8. The will, in regard to what it wills</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2008.htm#article1"> Is the will of good only?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2008.htm#article2"> Is it of the end only, or also of the means?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2008.htm#article3"> If in any way it be of the means, is it moved to the end and to the means, by the same movement?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the will is of good only?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> only. For the same power regards opposites; for instance, sight regards white and black. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are opposites. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not only of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but also of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, rational powers can be directed to opposite purposes, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. ix, 2). But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a rational power, since it is "in the reason," as is stated in De Anima iii, 9. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be directed to opposites; and consequently its volition is not confined to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but extends to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and being are convertible. But volition is directed not only to beings, but also to non-beings. For sometimes we wish "not to walk," or "not to speak"; and again at times we wish for future things, which are not actual beings. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> only.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is outside the scope of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>," and that "all things desire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now every <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is only of something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. The reason of this is that the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is nothing else than an inclination of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> desirous of a thing towards that thing. Now every inclination is to something like and suitable to the thing inclined. Since, therefore, everything, inasmuch as it is being and <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it must needs be that every inclination is to something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And hence it is that the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 1) that "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is that which all desire."

<p>But it must be noted that, since every inclination results from a form, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> results from a form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things: while the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as also the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> or rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which we call the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, follows from an apprehended form. Therefore, just as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in a thing; so the animal or <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is apprehended. Consequently, in order that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tend to anything, it is requisite, not that this be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but that it be apprehended as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii, 3) that "the end is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or an apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The same power regards opposites, but it is not referred to them in the same way. Accordingly, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is referred both to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: but to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by desiring it: to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, by shunning it. Wherefore the actual desire of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is called "volition" [In <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, 'voluntas'. To avoid confusion with "voluntas" (the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>) <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> adds a word of explanation, which in the translation may appear superfluous], meaning thereby the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; for it is in this sense that we are now speaking of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. On the other hand, the shunning of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is better described as "nolition": wherefore, just as volition is of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so nolition is of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A rational power is not to be directed to all opposite purposes, but to those which are contained under its proper object; for no power seeks other than its proper object. Now, the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be directed to such opposite purposes as are contained under <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, such as to be moved or to be at rest, to speak or to be silent, and such like: for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be directed to either under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which is not a being in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is considered as a being in the reason, wherefore negations and privations are said to be "beings of reason." In this way, too, future things, in so far as they are apprehended, are beings. Accordingly, in so far as such like are beings, they are apprehended under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and it is thus that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is directed to them. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1) that "to lack <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is considered as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether volition is of the end only, or also of the means?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that volition is not of the means, but of the end only. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 2) that "volition is of the end, while choice is of the means."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "For objects differing in genus there are corresponding different powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" (Ethic. vi, 1). Now, the end and the means are in different genera of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: because the end, which is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> either of rectitude or of pleasure, is in the genus "<a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>," or "action," or "passion"; whereas the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is useful, and is directed to and end, is in the genus "relation" (Ethic. i, 6). Therefore, if volition is of the end, it is not of the means.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are proportionate to powers, since they are perfections thereof. But in those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> which are called practical arts, the end belongs to one, and the means to another art; thus the use of a ship, which is its end, belongs to the (art of the) helmsman; whereas the building of the ship, which is directed to the end, belongs to the art of the shipwright. Therefore, since volition is of the end, it is not of the means.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, it is by the same power that a thing passes through the middle space, and arrives at the terminus. But the means are a kind of middle space, through which one arrives at the end or terminus. Therefore, if volition is of the end, it is also of the means.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word "voluntas" sometimes designates the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, sometimes its act [See note: above 01, Reply to Obj. 1. Accordingly, if we speak of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as a power, thus it extends both to the end and to the means. For every power extends to those things in which may be considered the aspect of the object of that power in any way whatever: thus the sight extends to all things whatsoever that are in any way colored. Now the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the object of the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, may be found not only in the end, but also in the means.

<p>If, however, we speak of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in regard to its act, then, properly speaking, volition is of the end only. Because every act denominated from a power, designates the simple act of that power: thus "to understand" designates the simple act of the understanding. Now the simple act of a power is referred to that which is in itself the object of that power. But that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and willed in itself is the end. Wherefore volition, properly speaking, is of the end itself. On the other hand, the means are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and willed, not in themselves, but as referred to the end. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is directed to them, only in so far as it is directed to the end: so that what it wills in them, is the end. Thus, to understand, is properly directed to things that are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in themselves, i.e. first principles: but we do not speak of understanding with regard to things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through first principles, except in so far as we see the principles in those things. For in morals the end is what principles are in speculative science (Ethic. viii, 8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in reference to the simple act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; not in reference to the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There are different powers for objects that differ in genus and are on an equality; for instance, sound and color are different genera of sensibles, to which are referred hearing and sight. But the useful and the righteous are not on an equality, but are as that which is of itself, and that which is in relation to another. Now such like objects are always referred to the same power; for instance, the power of sight perceives both color and light by which color is seen.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not everything that diversifies <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, diversifies the powers: since <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are certain determinations of powers to certain special acts. Moreover, every practical art considers both the end and the means. For the art of the helmsman does indeed consider the end, as that which it effects; and the means, as that which it commands. On the other hand, the ship-building art considers the means as that which it effects; but it considers that which is the end, as that to which it refers what it effects. And again, in every practical art there is an end proper to it and means that belong properly to that art.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the will is moved by the same act to the end and to the means?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by the same act, to the end and to the means. Because according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Topic. iii, 2) "where one thing is on account of another there is only one." But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not will the means save on account of the end. Therefore it is moved to both by the same act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the end is the reason for willing the means, just as light is the reason of seeing colors. But light and colors are seen by the same act. Therefore it is the same movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whereby it wills the end and the means.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is one and the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement which tends through the middle space to the terminus. But the means are in comparison to the end, as the middle space is to the terminus. Therefore it is the same movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> whereby it is directed to the end and to the means.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Acts are diversified according to their objects. But the end is a different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from the means, which are a useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not moved to both by the same act.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the end is willed in itself, whereas the means, as such, are only willed for the end, it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be moved to the end, without being moved to the means; whereas it cannot be moved to the means, as such, unless it is moved to the end. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved to the end in two ways: first, to the end absolutely and in itself; secondly, as the reason for willing the means. Hence it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by one and the same movement, to the end, as the reason for willing the means; and to the means themselves. But it is another act whereby the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved to the end absolutely. And sometimes this act precedes the other in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>; for example when a man first wills to have health, and afterwards deliberating by what means to be healed, wills to send for the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctor</a> to heal him. The same happens in regard to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: for at first a man understands the principles in themselves; but afterwards he understands them in the conclusions, inasmuch as he assents to the conclusions on account of the principles.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument holds in respect of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> being moved to the end as the reason for willing the means.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Whenever color is seen, by the same act the light is seen; but the light can be seen without the color being seen. In like manner whenever a man wills the means, by the same act he wills the end; but not the conversely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the execution of a work, the means are as the middle space, and the end, as the terminus. Wherefore just as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement sometimes stops in the middle and does not reach the terminus; so sometimes one is busy with the means, without gaining the end. But in willing it is the reverse: the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> through (willing) the end comes to will the means; just as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> arrives at the conclusions through the principles which are called "means." Hence it is that sometimes the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands a mean, and does not proceed thence to the conclusion. And in like manner the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> sometimes wills the end, and yet does not proceed to will the means.

<p>The solution to the argument in the contrary sense is clear from what has been said above (02, ad 2). For the useful and the righteous are not <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in an equal degree, but are as that which is for its own sake and that which is for the sake of something else: wherefore the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be directed to one and not to the other; but not conversely.
