<h1>Question 90. The essence of law</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2090.htm#article1"> Is law something pertaining to reason?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2090.htm#article2"> The end of law</a> <li><a href="../summa/2090.htm#article3"> Its cause</a> <li><a href="../summa/2090.htm#article4"> The promulgation of law</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether law is something pertaining to reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not something pertaining to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans 7:23</a>): "I see another <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in my members," etc. But nothing pertaining to reason is in the members; since the reason does not make use of a bodily organ. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not something pertaining to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the reason there is nothing else but power, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and act. But <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not the power itself of reason. In like manner, neither is it a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of reason: because the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of reason are the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of which we have spoken above (<a href="#57">Article 57</a>). Nor again is it an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: because then <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> would cease, when the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> ceases, for instance, while we are asleep. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is nothing pertaining to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> moves those who are subject to it to act aright. But it belongs properly to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to move to act, as is evident from what has been said above (Question 9, Article 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> pertains, not to the reason, but to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; according to the words of the Jurist (Lib. i, ff., De Const. Prin. leg. i): "Whatsoever pleaseth the sovereign, has force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to command and to forbid. But it belongs to reason to command, as stated above (Question 17, Article 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is something pertaining to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Law is a rule and measure of acts, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is induced to act or is restrained from acting: for "lex" [<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>] is derived from "ligare" [to bind], because it binds one to act. Now the rule and measure of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> is the reason, which is the first principle of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, as is evident from what has been stated above (1, 1, ad 3); since it belongs to the reason to direct to the end, which is the first principle in all matters of action, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. ii). Now that which is the principle in any genus, is the rule and measure of that genus: for instance, unity in the genus of numbers, and the first movement in the genus of movements. Consequently it follows that <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is something pertaining to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is a kind of rule and measure, it may be in something in two ways. First, as in that which measures and rules: and since this is proper to reason, it follows that, in this way, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is in the reason alone. Secondly, as in that which is measured and ruled. In this way, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is in all those things that are inclined to something by reason of some <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: so that any inclination arising from a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, may be called a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> but by participation as it were. And thus the inclination of the members to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is called "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the members."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as, in external action, we may consider the work and the work done, for instance the work of building and the house built; so in the acts of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, we may consider the act itself of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, i.e. to understand and to reason, and something produced by this act. With regard to the speculative reason, this is first of all the definition; secondly, the proposition; thirdly, the syllogism or argument. And since also the practical reason makes use of a syllogism in respect of the work to be done, as stated above (13, 3; 76, 1) and since as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> teaches (Ethic. vii, 3); hence we find in the practical reason something that holds the same position in regard to operations, as, in the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the proposition holds in regard to conclusions. Such like universal propositions of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> that are directed to actions have the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. And these propositions are sometimes under our actual consideration, while sometimes they are retained in the reason by means of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> has its power of moving from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (Question 17, Article 1): for it is due to the fact that one wills the end, that the reason issues its commands as regards things ordained to the end. But in order that the volition of what is commanded may have the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, it needs to be in accord with some rule of reason. And in this sense is to be understood the saying that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the sovereign has the force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; otherwise the sovereign's will would savor of lawlessness rather than of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the law is always something directed to the common good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not always directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as to its end. For it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to command and to forbid. But commands are directed to certain <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> goods. Therefore the end of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not always the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his actions. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are concerned with particular matters. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is directed to some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 3): "If the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is based on reason, whatever is based on reason will be a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." But reason is the foundation not only of what is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but also of that which is directed private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not only directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of all, but also to the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 21) that "laws are enacted for no private profit, but for the common benefit of the citizens."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> belongs to that which is a principle of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, because it is their rule and measure. Now as reason is a principle of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, so in reason itself there is something which is the principle in respect of all the rest: wherefore to this principle chiefly and mainly <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> must needs be referred. Now the first principle in practical matters, which are the object of the practical reason, is the last end: and the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life is bliss or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as stated above (2, 7; 3, 1). Consequently the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> must needs regard principally the relationship to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Moreover, since every part is ordained to the whole, as imperfect to perfect; and since one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a part of the perfect community, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> must needs regard properly the relationship to universal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, in the above definition of legal matters mentions both <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and the body politic: for he says (Ethic. v, 1) that we call those legal matters "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, which are adapted to produce and preserve <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and its parts for the body politic": since the state is a perfect community, as he says in Polit. i, 1.

<p>Now in every genus, that which belongs to it chiefly is the principle of the others, and the others belong to that genus in subordination to that thing: thus fire, which is chief among hot things, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of heat in mixed bodies, and these are said to be hot in so far as they have a share of fire. Consequently, since the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is chiefly ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, any other precept in regard to some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> work, must needs be devoid of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, save in so far as it regards the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A command denotes an application of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to matters regulated by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now the order to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, at which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> aims, is applicable to particular ends. And in this way commands are given even concerning particular matters.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Actions are indeed concerned with particular matters: but those particular matters are referable to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not as to a common genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but as to a common final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, according as the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is said to be the common end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as nothing stands firm with regard to the speculative reason except that which is traced back to the first indemonstrable principles, so nothing stands firm with regard to the practical reason, unless it be directed to the last end which is the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and whatever stands to reason in this sense, has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the reason of any man is competent to make laws?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the reason of any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is competent to make laws. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse14">Romans 2:14</a>) that "when the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who have not the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, do by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> those things that are of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, . . . they are a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to themselves." Now he says this of all in general. Therefore anyone can make a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (<em>Ethic.</em> ii. 1), "the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver is to lead men to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." But every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can lead another to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore the reason of any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is competent to make laws.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the sovereign of a state governs the state, so every father of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> governs his household. But the sovereign of a state can make laws for the state. Therefore every father of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> can make laws for his household.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (<em>Etym.</em> v. 10): "A <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is an ordinance of the people, whereby something is sanctioned by the Elders together with the Commonalty."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, properly speaking, regards first and foremost the order to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now to order anything to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, belongs either to the whole people, or to someone who is the viceregent of the whole people. And therefore the making of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> belongs either to the whole people or to a public personage who has care of the whole people: since in all other matters the directing of anything to the end concerns him to whom the end belongs.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (A. 1 ad 1), a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> not only as in one that rules, but also by participation as in one that is ruled. In the latter way each one is a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to himself, in so far as he shares the direction that he receives from one who rules him. Hence the same text goes on: "Who shows the work of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> written in their hearts."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot lead another to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> efficaciously: for he can only advise, and if his advice be not taken, it has no coercive power, such as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should have, in order to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> an efficacious inducement to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (<em>Ethic.</em> x. 9). But this coercive power is vested in the whole people or in some public personage, to whom it belongs to inflict penalties, as we shall state further on (Q. 92, A. 2 ad 3; II-II, Q. 64, A. 3). Wherefore the framing of laws belongs to him alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a part of the household, so a household is a part of the state: and the state is a perfect community, according to <em>Polit.</em> i. 1. And therefore, as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not the last end, but is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; so too the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one household is ordained to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a single state, which is a perfect community. Consequently he that governs a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, can indeed make certain commands or ordinances, but not such as to have properly the force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether promulgation is essential to a law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that promulgation is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> above all has the character of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> needs no promulgation. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that it be promulgated.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs properly to a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to bind one to do or not to do something. But the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of fulfilling a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> touches not only those in whose presence it is promulgated, but also others. Therefore promulgation is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the binding force of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> extends even to the future, since "laws are binding in matters of the future," as the jurists say (Cod. 1, tit. De lege et constit. leg. vii). But promulgation concerns those who are present. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is laid down in the Decretals, dist. 4, that "laws are established when they are promulgated."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is imposed on others by way of a rule and measure. Now a rule or measure is imposed by being applied to those who are to be ruled and measured by it. Wherefore, in order that a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> obtain the binding force which is proper to a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, it must needs be applied to the men who have to be ruled by it. Such application is made by its being notified to them by promulgation. Wherefore promulgation is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to obtain its force.

<p>Thus from the four preceding articles, the definition of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> may be gathered; and it is nothing else than an ordinance of reason for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is promulgated by the very fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> instilled it into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind so as to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by him <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who are not present when a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is promulgated, are bound to observe the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in so far as it is notified or can be notified to them by others, after it has been promulgated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The promulgation that takes place now, extends to future time by reason of the durability of written characters, by which means it is continually promulgated. Hence <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 3; ii, 10) that "lex [<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>] is derived from legere [to read] because it is written."
