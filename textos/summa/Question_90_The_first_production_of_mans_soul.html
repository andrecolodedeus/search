<h1>Question 90. The first production of man's soul</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1090.htm#article1"> Was man's soul something made, or was it of the Divine substance?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1090.htm#article2"> If made, was it created?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1090.htm#article3"> Was it made by angelic instrumentality?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1090.htm#article4"> Was it made before the body?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the soul was made or was of God's substance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not made, but was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse7">Genesis 2:7</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> formed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the slime of the earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made a living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." But he who breathes sends forth something of himself. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lives, is of the Divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as above explained (75, 5), the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a simple form. But a form is an act. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>; which applies to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> and do differ are the same. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, and in no way differ, for they could only be differentiated by certain differences, and thus would be composite. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind are the same.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Orig. Animae iii, 15) mentions certain opinions which he calls "exceedingly and evidently perverse, and contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>," among which the first is the opinion that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> not out of nothing, but from Himself."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of the Divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> involves a manifest improbability. For, as is clear from what has been said (77, 2; 79, 2; 84, 6), the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sometimes in a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to the act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> -- acquires its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> somehow from things--and thus has various powers; all of which are incompatible with the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, Which is a <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>--receives nothing from any other--and admits of no variety in itself, as we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> (3, 1,7; 9, 1).

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> seems to have originated from two statements of the ancients. For those who first began to observe the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things, being unable to rise above their <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, supposed that nothing but bodies <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. Therefore they said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was a body, which they considered to be the principle of other bodies. And since they held that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as that body which they regarded as the first principle, as is stated De Anima i, 2, it followed that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. According to this supposition, also, the Manichaeans, thinking that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was corporeal light, held that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was part of that light bound up with the body.

<p>Then a further step in advance was made, and some surmised the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of something incorporeal, not apart from the body, but the form of a body; so that Varro said, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> governing the world by movement and reason," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> relates (De Civ. Dei vii, 6 [The words as quoted are to be found iv. 31.) So some supposed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be part of that one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a part of the whole world; for they were unable to go so far as to understand the different degrees of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, except according to the distinction of bodies.

<p>But, all these theories are impossible, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (3, 1,8 and 75, 1), wherefore it is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The term "breathe" is not to be taken in the material sense; but as regards the act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to breathe [spirare], is the same as to "make a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>." Moreover, in the material sense, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by breathing does not send forth anything of his own <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but an extraneous thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a simple form in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, yet it is not its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but is a being by participation, as above explained (75, 5, ad 4). Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a> like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which differs, properly speaking, differs in something; wherefore we seek for difference where we find also resemblance. For this reason things which differ must in some way be compound; since they differ in something, and in something resemble each other. In this sense, although all that differ are diverse, yet all things that are diverse do not differ. For simple things are diverse; yet do not differ from one another by differences which enter into their composition. For instance, a man and a horse differ by the difference of rational and irrational; but we cannot say that these again differ by some further difference.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the soul was produced by creation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not produced by creation. For that which has in itself something material is produced from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in part material, since it is not a <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was made of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and hence it was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is educed from the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; for since <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, any act pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the act of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as is clear from its definition. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is educed from the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a form. Therefore, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, all other forms also are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. Thus no forms would come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by generation; which is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse27">Genesis 1:27</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to His own image." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can be made only by creation; which, however, is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of other forms. The reason is because, since to be made is the way to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, a thing must be made in such a way as is suitable to its mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Now that properly <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> which itself has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; as it were, subsisting in its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Wherefore only <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are properly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> called beings; whereas an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> has not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but something is (modified) by it, and so far is it called a being; for instance, whiteness is called a being, because by it something is white. Hence it is said Metaph. vii, Did. vi, 1 that an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> should be described as "of something rather than as something." The same is to be said of all non-subsistent forms. Therefore, properly speaking, it does not belong to any non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> form to be made; but such are said to be made through the composite <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> being made. On the other hand, the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a subsistent form, as above explained (75, 2). Wherefore it is competent to be and to be made. And since it cannot be made of pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>--whether corporeal, which would render it a corporeal being--or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, which would involve the transmutation of one <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> into another, we must conclude that it cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> except by creation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> simple <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is as the material element, while its participated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is its formal element; which participated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> co-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, because <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> follows the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. The same reason holds if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is supposed to be composed of some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as some maintain; because the said <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to another form, as neither is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a celestial body; otherwise the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would be corruptible. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot in any way be made of pre-existent <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The production of act from the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is nothing else but something becoming actually that previously was in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. But since the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not depend in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> on corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and is subsistent, and exceeds the capacity of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as we have seen (75, 2), it is not educed from the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As we have said, there is no comparison between the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and other forms.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the rational soul is produced by God immediately?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not immediately made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by the instrumentality of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things have more order than corporeal things. But inferior bodies are produced by means of the superior, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore also the inferior spirits, who are the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, are produced by means of the superior spirits, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the end corresponds to the beginning of things; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the beginning and end of all. Therefore the issue of things from their beginning corresponds to the forwarding of them to their end. But "inferior things are forwarded by the higher," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. v); therefore also the inferior are produced into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by the higher, and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "perfect is that which can produce its like," as is stated Metaph. v. But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are much more perfect than corporeal. Therefore, since bodies produce their like in their own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, much more are <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> able to produce something specifically inferior to themselves; and such is the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse7">Genesis 2:7</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself "breathed into the face of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the breath of life."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have held that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, acting by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, produce rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. But this is quite impossible, and is against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For it has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be produced except by creation. Now, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can create; for the first agent alone can act without presupposing the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of anything; while the second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> always presupposes something derived from the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as above explained (75, 3): and every agent, that presupposes something to its act, acts by making a change therein. Therefore everything else acts by producing a change, whereas <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone acts by creation. Since, therefore, the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be produced by a change in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it cannot be produced, save immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Thus the replies to the objections are clear. For that bodies produce their like or something inferior to themselves, and that the higher things lead forward the inferior--all these things are effected through a certain transmutation.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the human soul was produced before the body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was made before the body. For the work of creation preceded the work of distinction and adornment, as shown above (66, 1; 70, 1). But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was made by creation; whereas the body was made at the end of the work of adornment. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made before the body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has more in common with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> than with the brute animals. But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> before bodies, or at least, at the beginning with corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; whereas the body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was formed on the sixth day, when also the animals were made. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> before the body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the end is proportionate to the beginning. But in the end the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> outlasts the body. Therefore in the beginning it was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> before the body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The proper act is produced in its proper <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Therefore since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the proper act of the body, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was produced in the body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Peri Archon i, 7,8) held that not only the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at the same time as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, before their bodies: because he thought that all <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, are equal in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, and differ only by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; so that some of them--namely, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> or of heavenly bodies--are united to bodies while others remain in their different orders entirely free from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Of this opinion we have already spoken (47, 2); and so we need say nothing about it here.

<p><a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, however (Gen. ad lit. vii, 24), says that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at the same time as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, before the body, for another reason; because he supposes that the body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, during the work of the six days, was produced, not actually, but only as to some "<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>"; which cannot be said of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because neither was it made of any pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> corporeal or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, nor could it be produced from any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, during the work of the six days, when all things were made, was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and that afterwards, by its own will, was joined to the service of the body. But he does not say this by way of assertion; as his words <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>. For he says (Gen. ad lit. vii, 29): "We may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, if neither <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> nor reason forbid, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made on the sixth day, in the sense that his body was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> as to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the elements of the world, but that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was already <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>."

<p>Now this could be upheld by those who hold that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has of itself a complete <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and that it is not united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but as its administrator. But if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the above supposition is quite impossible. For it is clear that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the first things in their perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> state, as their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> required. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, has its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection only as united to the body. Therefore it would have been unfitting for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> without the body.

<p>Therefore, if we admit the opinion of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> about the work of the six days (74, 2), we may say that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> preceded in the work of the six days by a certain generic similitude, so far as it has <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in common with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but was itself <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at the same time as the body. According to the other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, both the body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were produced in the work of the six days.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> were a complete <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, so that it might be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> as to itself, this reason would <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by itself in the beginning. But as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> the form of the body, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, not separately, but in the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The same observation applies to the second objection. For if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of itself it would have something still more in common with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But, as the form of the body, it belongs to the animal genus, as a formal principle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remains after the body, is due to a defect of the body, namely, death. Which defect was not due when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.
