<h1>Question 90. The form of the judge in coming to the judgment</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5090.htm#article1"> Will Christ judge under the form of His humanity?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5090.htm#article2"> Will He appear under the form of His glorified humanity?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5090.htm#article3"> Can His Godhead be seen without joy?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ will judge under the form of His humanity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will not judge under the form of His humanity. For judgment requires authority in the judge. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has authority over the quick and the dead as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for thus is He the Lord and Creator of all. Therefore He will judge under the form of His Godhead.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, invincible power is requisite in a judge; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse6">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a>): "Seek not to be made a judge, unless thou have strength enough to extirpate iniquities." Now invincible power belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore He will judge under the form of the Godhead.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse22">John 5:22-23</a>): "The Father . . . hath given all judgment to the Son, that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the Son as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the Father." Now equal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to that of the Father is not due to the Son in respect of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore He will not judge under His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse9">Daniel 7:9</a>): "I beheld till thrones were placed and the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">Ancient of days</a> sat." Now the thrones signify judicial power, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called the Ancient by reason of His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. x). Therefore it becomes the Son to judge as being <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and consequently not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xix in Joan.) that "the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">resurrection of the soul</a> is the work of the Word the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a> is the work of the Word made the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> in the flesh." Now that <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rather than the body. Therefore it becomes <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to judge as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather than as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse27">John 5:27</a>): "He hath given Him power to do judgment, because He is the Son of man."

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/job036.htm#verse17">Job 36:17</a>): "Thy <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> hath been judged as that of the wicked--by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>" according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>--therefore, "<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and judgment thou shalt recover--that thou mayest judge <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>," according to the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was judged by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> with regard to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore He will judge under the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Further, to Him it belongs to judge who made the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave us the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Gospel while appearing in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore He will judge under that same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Judgment requires a certain authority in the judge. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse4">Romans 14:4</a>): "Who art thou that judgest another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> servant?" Hence it is becoming that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should judge in respect of His having authority over men to whom chiefly the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a> will be directed. Now He is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, not only by reason of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">Creation</a>, since "the Lord He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He made us and not we ourselves" (<a href="../bible/psa099.htm#verse3">Psalm 99:3</a>), but also by reason of the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a>, which pertains to Him in respect of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore "to this end <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died and rose again, that He might be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> both of the dead and of the living" (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse9">Romans 14:9</a>). But the goods of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">Creation</a> would not suffice us to obtain the reward of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, without the addition of the boon of the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a>, on account of the obstacle accruing to <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> through the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>. Hence, since the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a> is directed to the admission of some to the kingdom, and the exclusion of others therefrom, it is becoming that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should preside at that judgment under the form of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since it is by favor of that same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is admitted to the kingdom. In this sense it is stated (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse42">Acts 10:42</a>) that "He . . . was appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be Judge of the living and of the dead." And forasmuch as by <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redeeming</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> He restored not only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> but all creatures without exception--inasmuch as all creatures are bettered through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> restoration, according to <a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse20">Colossians 1:20</a>, "Making peace through the blood of His <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, both as to things on earth, and the things that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>"--it follows that through His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> lordship and judicial power not over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> alone, but over all creatures, according to <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse18">Matthew 28:18</a>, "All power is given to Me, in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and in earth" [Cf. III, 59].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in respect of His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, has authority of lordship over all creatures by right of creation; but in respect of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> He has authority of lordship <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> through His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. The latter is secondary so to speak and acquired, while the former is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has not of Himself invincible power resulting from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, nevertheless there is also in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> an invincible power derived from His Godhead, whereby all things are subjected under His feet (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse25">1 Corinthians 15:25-28</a>; <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse8">Hebrews 2:8-9</a>). Hence He will judge in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> indeed, but by the power of His Godhead.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would not have sufficed for the redemption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, had He been a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore from the very fact that He was able as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to redeem <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and thereby obtained judicial power, it is evident that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and consequently is to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> equally with the Father, not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In that vision of <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> the whole order of the judicial power is clearly expressed. This power is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself as its first origin, and more especially in the Father Who is the fount of the entire Godhead; wherefore it is stated in the first place that the "<a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">Ancient of days</a> sat." But the judicial power was transmitted from the Father to the Son, not only from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in respect of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but also in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in respect of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> wherein He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> it. Hence in the aforesaid vision it is further stated (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse13">Daniel 7:13-14</a>): "Lo, one like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> came with the clouds of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and He came even to the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">Ancient of days</a> . . . And He gave Him power and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and a kingdom."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking by a kind of appropriation, so as to trace the effects which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wrought in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> somewhat similar to them. And since we are made to the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in respect of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and are of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in respect of our body, he ascribes to the Godhead the effects wrought by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and those which He wrought or will work in our bodies he ascribes to His flesh; although His flesh, as being the instrument of His Godhead, has also its effect on our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> asserts (De Fide Orth. iii, 15), according to the saying of <a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse14">Hebrews 9:14</a>, that His "blood" hath cleansed "our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> from dead works." And thus that "the Word was made flesh" is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">resurrection of souls</a>; wherefore also according to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> He is becomingly the Judge not only of bodily but also of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods [Cf. III, 56, 2, ad 1].

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether at the judgment Christ will appear in His glorified humanity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that at the judgment <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will not appear in His glorified humanity. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, Tract. cxx in Joan.] on <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse37">John 19:37</a>, "They shall look on him whom they pierced," says: "Because He will come in the flesh wherein He was crucified." Now He was crucified in the form of weakness. Therefore He will appear in the form of weakness and not in the form of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is stated (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse30">Matthew 24:30</a>) that "the sign of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall appear in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," namely, "the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>," as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. lxxvii in Matth.), for "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when coming to the judgment will show not only the scars of His wounds but even His most shameful death." Therefore it seems that He will not appear in the form of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will appear at the judgment under that form which can be gazed upon by all. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will not be visible to all, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, under the form of His glorified humanity: because the eye that is not glorified is seemingly unproportionate to see the clarity of a glorified body. Therefore He will not appear under a glorified form.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, that which is promised as a reward to the righteous is not granted to the unrighteous. Now it is promised as a reward to the righteous that they shall see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His humanity (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse9">John 10:9</a>): "He shall go in, and go out, and shall find pastures, i.e. refreshment in His Godhead and humanity," according to the commentary of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [De Spiritu et Anima, work of an unknown author. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, De Anima, ascribes it to Alcherus, a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>; see above 70, 2, ad 1 and <a href="../bible/isa033.htm#verse17">Isaiah 33:17</a>: "His eyes shall see the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">King</a> in his beauty." Therefore He will not appear to all in His glorified form.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will judge in the form wherein He was judged: wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, Tract. xix, in Joan.] on <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse21">John 5:21</a>, "So the Son also giveth life to whom He will," says: "He will judge <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> in the form wherein He was judged <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, that He may be visible to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>." Now He was judged in the form of weakness. Therefore He will appear in the same form at the judgment.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse27">Luke 21:27</a>): "Then they shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming in a cloud with great power and majesty." Now majesty and power pertain to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore He will appear in the form of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p>Further, he who judges should be more conspicuous than those who are judged. Now the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> who will be judged by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will have a glorified body. Much more therefore will the Judge appear in a glorified form.

<p>Further, as to be judged pertains to weakness, so to judge pertains to authority and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Now at His first coming when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to be judged, He appeared in the form of weakness. Therefore at the second coming, when He will come to judge, He will appear in the form of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called the mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 2:5</a>) inasmuch as He satisfies for men and intercedes for them to the Father, and confers on men things which belong to the Father, according to <a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse22">John 17:22</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which Thou hast given Me, I have given to them." Accordingly then both these things belong to Him in that He communicates with both extremes: for in that He communicates with men, He takes their part with the Father, and in that He communicates with the Father, He bestows the Father's <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> on men. Since then at His first coming He came in order to make satisfaction for us to the Father, He came in the form of our weakness. But since at His second coming He will come in order to execute the Father's <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> on men, He will have to show forth His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is in Him by reason of His communication with the Father: and therefore He will appear in the form of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He will appear in the same flesh, but not under the same form.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> will appear at the judgment, to denote not a present but a past weakness: so as to show how <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> those were condemned who scorned so great mercy, especially those who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>. The scars which will appear in His body will not be due to weakness, but will indicate the exceeding power whereby <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> overcame His enemies by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and infirmity. He will also show forth His most shameful death, not by bringing it sensibly before the eye, as though He suffered it there; but by the things which will appear then, namely the signs of His past <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, He will recall men to the thought of His past death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A glorified body has it in its power to show itself or not to show itself to an eye that is not glorified, as stated above (85, 2, ad 3). Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will be visible to all in His glorified form.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Even as our friend's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> gives us pleasure, so the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and power of one we <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> is most displeasing to us. Hence as the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity will be a reward to the righteous, so will it be a torment to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> enemies: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse11">Isaiah 26:11</a>): "Let the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> people see and be confounded and let fire" (i.e. <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>) "devour Thy enemies."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">Form</a> is taken there for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> wherein He was judged and likewise will judge; but not for a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, namely of weakness, which will not be the same in Him when judging as when judged (Cf. ad 2).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the Godhead can be seen by the wicked without joy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> can be seen by the wicked without <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. For there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the wicked will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with the greatest <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore they will see His <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a>, and yet they will not rejoice in seeing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore it will be possible to see it without <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the perverse will of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is not more adverse to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity than to His Godhead. Now the fact that they will see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His humanity will conduce to their punishment, as stated above (2, ad 4). Therefore if they were to see His Godhead, there would be much more reason for them to grieve rather than rejoice.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the course of the affections is not a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sequel to that which is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (In Ps. 118: conc. 8): "The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> precedes, the affections follow slowly or not at all." Now vision regards the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> regards the affections. Therefore it will be possible to see the Godhead without <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whatever is received into "a thing is received according to the mode of the receiver and not of the received." But whatever is seen is, in a way, received into the seer. Therefore although the Godhead is in itself supremely enjoyable, nevertheless when seen by those who are plunged in grief, it will give no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> but rather displeasure.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, as sense is to the sensible object, so is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the intelligible object. Now in the senses, "to the unhealthy palate bread is painful, to the healthy palate sweet," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. vii), and the same happens with the other senses. Therefore since the damned have the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> indisposed, it would seem that the vision of the uncreated light will give them pain rather than <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a>): "This is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>: That they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Thee, the . . . <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Wherefore it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of bliss consists in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to bliss. Therefore the Godhead cannot be seen without <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Godhead is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now it is delightful to every one to see the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, wherefore "all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>," as stated at the beginning of the Metaphysics. Therefore it is impossible to see the Godhead without <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p>Further, if a certain vision is not always delightful, it happens sometimes to be painful. But <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> vision is never painful since "the pleasure we take in objects of understanding has no grief opposed to it," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Topic. ii). Since then the Godhead cannot be seen save by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it seems that the Godhead cannot be seen without <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In every object of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or of pleasure two things may be considered, namely the thing which is desired or which gives pleasure, and the aspect of appetibility or pleasurableness in that thing. Now according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Hebdom.) that which is can have something besides what it is, but 'being' itself has no admixture of aught else beside itself. Hence that which is desirable or pleasant can have an admixture of something rendering it undesirable or unpleasant; but the very aspect of pleasurableness has not and cannot have anything mixed with it rendering it unpleasant or undesirable. Now it is possible for things that are pleasurable, by participation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which is the aspect of appetibility or pleasurableness, not to give pleasure when they are apprehended, but it is impossible for that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> not to give pleasure when it is apprehended. Therefore since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, it is impossible for the Godhead to be seen without <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The wicked will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> most clearly that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not through seeing His Godhead, but on account of the most manifest signs of His Godhead.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> No one can <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> considered in itself, as neither can one <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> itself. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in respect of some of the effects of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a>, in so far as He does or commands something contrary to their will [Cf. II-II, 34, 1]. Therefore the vision of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> can be painful to no one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> applies when the thing apprehended previously by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by participation and not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, such as all creatures are; wherefore there may be something in them by reason of which the affections are not moved. In like manner <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by wayfarers through His effects, and their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not attain to the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Hence it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the affections follow the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as they would if the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> which is His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Grief denotes not a disposition but a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Now every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> is removed if a stronger contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> supervene, and does not remove that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Accordingly the grief of the damned would be done away if they saw God in His essence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The indisposition of an organ removes the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> proportion of the organ to the object that has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to please, wherefore the pleasure is hindered. But the indisposition which is in the damned does not remove the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> proportion whereby they are directed to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, since its image ever remains in them. Hence the comparison fails.
