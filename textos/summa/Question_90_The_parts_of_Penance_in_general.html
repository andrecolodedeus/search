<h1>Question 90. The parts of Penance, in general</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4090.htm#article1"> Does Penance have any parts?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4090.htm#article2"> The number of its parts</a> <li><a href="../summa/4090.htm#article3"> What kind of parts are they?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4090.htm#article4"> Its division into subjective parts</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Penance should be assigned any parts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that parts should not be assigned to Penance. For it is the Divine power that works our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> most secretly in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Now the Divine power is one and simple. Therefore Penance, being a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, should have no parts assigned to it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Penance is both a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now no parts are assigned to it as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, which is a simple <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. In like manner, it seems that parts should not be assigned to Penance as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because no parts are assigned to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Therefore no parts at all should be assigned to Penance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of Penance is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 84, Article 2). But no parts are assigned to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Neither, therefore, should parts be assigned to Penance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The parts of a thing are those out of which the whole is composed. Now the perfection of Penance is composed of several things, viz. <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, confession, and satisfaction. Therefore Penance has parts.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The parts of a thing are those into which the whole is divided materially, for the parts of a thing are to the whole, what <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is to the form; wherefore the parts are reckoned as a kind of material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and the whole as a kind of <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> (Phys. ii). Accordingly wherever, on the part of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, we find a kind of plurality, there we shall find a reason for assigning parts.

<p>Now it has been stated above (84, 2,3), that, in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions stand as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: and so, since several actions are requisite for the perfection of Penance, viz., <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, confession, and satisfaction, as we shall show further on (2), it follows that the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> has parts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Every sacrament is something simple by reason of the Divine power, which operates therein: but the Divine power is so great that it can operate both through one and through many, and by reason of these many, parts may be assigned to a particular sacrament.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Parts are not assigned to penance as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> of which there are several in penance, are related to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not as its parts, but as its effects. It follows, therefore, that parts are assigned to Penance as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, to which the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are related as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: whereas in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not consist of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, but of some one external thing, either simple, as water or oil, or compound, as <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, and so parts are not assigned to the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sins</a> are the remote <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of Penance, inasmuch, to wit, as they are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or object of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, which are the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of Penance as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether contrition, confession, and satisfaction are fittingly assigned as parts of Penance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, confession, and satisfaction are not fittingly assigned as parts of Penance. For <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is in the heart, and so belongs to interior penance; while confession consists of words, and satisfaction in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; so that the two latter belong to interior penance. Now interior penance is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but only exterior penance which is perceptible by the senses. Therefore these three parts are not fittingly assigned to the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conferred in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, as stated above (62, 1,3). But no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conferred in satisfaction. Therefore satisfaction is not part of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the fruit of a thing is not the same as its part. But satisfaction is a fruit of penance, according to <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse8">Luke 3:8</a>: "Bring forth . . . fruits worthy of penance." Therefore it is not a part of Penance.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, Penance is ordained against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be completed merely in the thought by consent, as stated in I-II, 72, 7: therefore Penance can also. Therefore confession in word and satisfaction in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> should not be reckoned as parts of Penance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It seems that yet more parts should be assigned to Penance. For not only is the body assigned as a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as being the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is his form. But the aforesaid three, being the acts of the penitent, stand as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> stands as form. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> should be assigned as a fourth part of Penance.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A part is twofold, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> and <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantitative</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> parts are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> the form and the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> the genus and the difference. In this way, each sacrament is divided into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> as its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> parts. Hence it has been said above (60, 5,6) that <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> consist of things and words. But since <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is on the part of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantitative</a> parts are parts of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: and, in this way, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), parts are assigned specially to the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, as regards the acts of the penitent, which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>Now it has been said above (85, 3, ad 3) that an offense is atoned otherwise in Penance than in vindictive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Because, in vindictive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> the atonement is made according to the judge's decision, and not according to the discretion of the offender or of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> offended; whereas, in Penance, the offense is atoned according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the sinner, and the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> against Whom the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was committed, because in the latter case we seek not only the restoration of the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as in vindictive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but also and still more the reconciliation of friendship, which is accomplished by the offender making atonement according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> offended. Accordingly the first requisite on the part of the penitent is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to atone, and this is done by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>; the second is that he submit to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> standing in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> place, and this is done in confession; and the third is that he atone according to the decision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> minister, and this is done in satisfaction: and so <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, confession, and satisfaction are assigned as parts of Penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Contrition, as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, is in the heart, and belongs to interior penance; yet, virtually, it belongs to exterior penance, inasmuch as it implies the purpose of confessing and making satisfaction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Satisfaction confers <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in so far as it is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> purpose, and it increases <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according as it is accomplished, just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> does in adults, as stated above (68, 2; 69, 8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Satisfaction is a part of Penance as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and a fruit of penance as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> More things are required for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, "which proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that is entire," than for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, "which results from each single defect," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). And thus, although <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is completed in the consent of the heart, yet the perfection of Penance requires <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> of the heart, together with confession in word and satisfaction in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>.

<p>The Reply to the Fifth Objection is clear from what has been said.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether these three are integral parts of Penance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that these three are not integral parts of Penance. For, as stated above (Question 84, Article 3), Penance is ordained against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of thought, word, and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> are the subjective and not integral parts of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is predicated of each one of them. Therefore in Penance also, <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> in thought, confession in word, and satisfaction in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> are not integral parts.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no integral part includes within itself another that is condivided with it. But <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> includes both confession and satisfaction in the purpose of amendment. Therefore they are not integral parts.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a whole is composed of its integral parts, taken at the same time and equally, just as a line is made up of its parts. But such is not the case here. Therefore these are not integral parts of Penance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Integral parts are those by which the perfection of the whole is integrated. But the perfection of Penance is integrated by these three. Therefore they are integral parts of Penance.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have said that these three are subjective parts of Penance. But this is impossible, because the entire power of the whole is present in each subjective part at the same time and equally, just as the entire power of an animal, as such, is assured to each animal <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, all of which <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> divide the animal genus at the same time and equally: which does not apply to the point in question. Wherefore others have said that these are <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> parts: yet neither can this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, since the whole is present, as to the entire <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, in each <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> part, just as the entire <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is present in each of its powers: which does not apply to the case in point. Therefore it follows that these three are integral parts of Penance, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of which is that the whole is not present in each of the parts, either as to its entire power, or as to its entire <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but that it is present to all of them together at the same time.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sin forasmuch as it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, can be completed in one single point, as stated above (2, ad 4); and so the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is completed in thought alone, is a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is completed in thought and word: and yet a third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is completed in thought, word, and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>; and the quasi-integral parts of this last <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are that which is in thought, that which is in word, and that which is in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Wherefore these three are the integral parts of Penance, which is completed in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> One integral part can include the whole, though not as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>: because the foundation, in a way, contains virtually the whole building. In this way <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> includes virtually the whole of Penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All integral parts have a certain relation of order to one another: but some are only related as to position, whether in sequence as the parts of an army, or by contact, as the parts of a heap, or by being fitted together, as the parts of a house, or by continuation, as the parts of a line; while some are related, in addition, as to power, as the parts of an animal, the first of which is the heart, the others in a certain order being dependent on one another: and thirdly some are related in the order of time: as the parts of time and movement. Accordingly the parts of Penance are related to one another in the order of power and time, since they are actions, but not in the order of position, since they do not occupy a place.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Penance is fittingly divided into penance before Baptism, penance for mortal sins, and penance for venial sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that penance is unfittingly divided into penance before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, penance for mortal, and penance for venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For Penance is the second plank after shipwreck, as stated above (Question 84, Article 6), while <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the first. Therefore that which precedes <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should not be called a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of penance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which can destroy the greater, can destroy the lesser. Now mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is greater than venial; and penance which regards mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> regards also venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore they should not be considered as different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of penance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> commits venial and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so does he before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. If therefore penance for venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is distinct from penance for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, in like manner they should be distinguished before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore penance is not fittingly divided into these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in De Poenitentia [Cf. Hom. 30 inter 1] that these three are <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of Penance.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This is a division of penance as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it must be observed that every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> acts in accordance with the time being, as also in keeping with other due circumstances, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance has its act at this time, according to the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p>Now it belongs to penance to detest one's past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to purpose, at the same time, to change one's life for the better, which is the end, so to speak, of penance. And since moral matters take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the end, as stated in I-II, 1, 3; I-II, 18, 4,6, it is reasonable to distinguish various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of penance, according to the various changes intended by the penitent.

<p>Accordingly there is a threefold change intended by the penitent. The first is by regeneration unto a new life, and this belongs to that penance which precedes <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. The second is by reforming one's past life after it has been already destroyed, and this belongs to penance for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. The third is by changing to a more perfect operation of life, and this belongs to penance for venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which are remitted through a fervent <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (87, 2,3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The penance which precedes <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> disposing one to that sacrament.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The penance which washes away mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, washes away venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also, but the converse does not hold. Wherefore these two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of penance are related to one another as perfect and imperfect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> there are no venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And since a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be remitted without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 87, Article 4), before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, penance for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is not distinct from penance for venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.
