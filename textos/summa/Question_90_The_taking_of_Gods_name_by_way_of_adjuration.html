<h1>Question 90. The taking of God's name by way of adjuration</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3090.htm#article1"> Is it lawful to adjure a man?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3090.htm#article2"> Is it lawful to adjure the demons?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3090.htm#article3"> Is it lawful to adjure irrational creatures?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is lawful to adjure a man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not lawful to adjure a man. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Tract. xxxv super Matth.): "I deem that a man who wishes to live according to the Gospel should not adjure another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For if, according to the Gospel mandate of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it be unlawful to swear, it is evident that neither is it lawful to adjure: and consequently it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> unlawfully adjured <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> by the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever adjures a man, compels him after a fashion. But it is unlawful to compel a man against his will. Therefore seemingly it is also unlawful to adjure a man.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to adjure is to induce a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to swear. Now it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> superior to induce him to swear, for the superior imposes an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> on his subject. Therefore subjects cannot adjure their superiors.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Even when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we implore Him by certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things: and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> too besought the faithful "by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans 12:1</a>): and this seems to be a kind of adjuration. Therefore it is lawful to adjure.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who utters a promissory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, swearing by his reverence for the Divine name, which he invokes in confirmation of his promise, binds himself to do what he has undertaken, and so orders himself unchangeably to do a certain thing. Now just as a man can order himself to do a certain thing, so too can he order others, by beseeching his superiors, or by commanding his inferiors, as stated above (Question 83, Article 1). Accordingly when either of these orderings is confirmed by something Divine it is an adjuration. Yet there is this difference between them, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is master of his own actions but not of those of others; wherefore he can put himself under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> by invoking the Divine name, whereas he cannot put others under such an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> unless they be his subjects, whom he can compel on the strength of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> they have taken.

<p>Therefore, if a man by invoking the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or any <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing, intends by this adjuration to put one who is not his subject under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to do a certain thing, in the same way as he would bind himself by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, such an adjuration is unlawful, because he usurps over another a power which he has not. But superiors may bind their inferiors by this kind of adjuration, if there be need for it.

<p>If, however, he merely intend, through reverence of the Divine name or of some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing, to obtain something from the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without putting him under any <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, such an adjuration may be lawfully employed in respect of anyone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> is speaking of an adjuration whereby a man intends to put another under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, in the same way as he would bind himself by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: for thus did the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> presume to adjure <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> [<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse63">Matthew 26:63</a>].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers the adjuration which imposes an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To adjure is not to induce a man to swear, but to employ terms resembling an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in order to provoke another to do a certain thing.

<p>Moreover, we adjure <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in one way and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in another; because when we adjure a man we intend to alter his will by appealing to his reverence for a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing: and we cannot have such an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> in respect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whose <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is immutable. If we obtain something from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> will, it is due, not to our <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, but to His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is lawful to adjure the demons?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful to adjure the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Tract. xxxv, super Matth.): "To adjure the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> is not accordance with the power given by our Saviour: for this is a Jewish practice." Now rather than imitate the rites of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, we should use the power given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore it is not lawful to adjure the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, many make use of necromantic incantations when invoking the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by something Divine: and this is an adjuration. Therefore, if it be lawful to adjure the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, it is lawful to make use of necromantic incantations, which is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore the antecedent is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> also.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever adjures a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, by that very fact associates himself with him. Now it is not lawful to have fellowship with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>, "I would not that you should be made partakers with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a>." Therefore it is not lawful to adjure the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse17">Mark 16:17</a>): "In My name they shall cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a>." Now to induce anyone to do a certain thing for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> name is to adjure. Therefore it is lawful to adjure the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in the preceding article, there are two ways of adjuring: one by way of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or inducement through reverence of some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing: the other by way of compulsion. On the first way it is not lawful to adjure the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> because such a way seems to savor of benevolence or friendship, which it is unlawful to bear towards the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. As to the second kind of adjuration, which is by compulsion, we may lawfully use it for some purposes, and not for others. For during the course of this life the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are our adversaries: and their actions are not subject to our disposal but to that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 4), "the rebel spirit is ruled by the just spirit." Accordingly we may repulse the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, as being our enemies, by adjuring them through the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> name, lest they do us harm of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or body, in accord with the Divine power given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as recorded by <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse19">Luke 10:19</a>: "Behold, I have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall hurt you."

<p>It is not, however, lawful to adjure them for the purpose of learning something from them, or of obtaining something through them, for this would amount to holding fellowship with them: except perhaps when certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, by special instinct or Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, make use of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' actions in order to obtain certain results: thus we read of the Blessed James [the Greater; cf. Apocrypha, N.T., Hist. Certam. Apost. vi, 19 that he <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> Hermogenes to be brought to him, by the instrumentality of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> is speaking of adjuration made, not authoritatively by way of compulsion, but rather by way of a friendly appeal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Necromancers adjure and invoke the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in order to obtain or learn something from them: and this is unlawful, as stated above. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, commenting on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> words to the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> spirit (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse25">Mark 1:25</a>), "Speak no more, and go out of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," says: "A salutary teaching is given us here, lest we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, however much they speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers the adjuration whereby the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon's</a> help is besought in doing or learning something: for this savors of fellowship with them. On the other hand, to repulse the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by adjuring them, is to sever oneself from their fellowship.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it is lawful to adjure an irrational creature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful to adjure an irrational creature. An adjuration consists of spoken words. But it is useless to speak to one that understands not, such as an irrational creature. Therefore it is vain and unlawful to adjure an irrational creature.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, seemingly wherever adjuration is admissible, swearing is also admissible. But swearing is not consistent with an irrational creature. Therefore it would seem unlawful to employ adjuration towards one.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there are two ways of adjuring, as explained above (1 and 2). One is by way of appeal; and this cannot be employed towards irrational creatures, since they are not masters of their own actions. The other kind of adjuration is by way of compulsion: and, seemingly, neither is it lawful to use this towards them, because we have not the power to command irrational creatures, but only He of Whom it was said (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse27">Matthew 8:27</a>): "For the winds and the sea obey Him." Therefore in no way, apparently, is it lawful to adjure irrational creatures.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Simon and Jude are related to have adjured dragons and to have commanded them to withdraw into the desert. [From the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Historiae Certam. Apost. vi. 19.]

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Irrational creatures are directed to their own actions by some other agent. Now the action of what is directed and moved is also the action of the director and mover: thus the movement of the arrow is an operation of the archer. Wherefore the operation of the irrational creature is ascribed not only to it, but also and chiefly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who disposes the movements of all things. It is also ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who, by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> permission, makes use of irrational creatures in order to inflict harm on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>Accordingly the adjuration of an irrational creature may be of two kinds. First, so that the adjuration is referred to the irrational creature in itself: and in this way it would be vain to adjure an irrational creature. Secondly, so that it be referred to the director and mover of the irrational creature, and in this sense a creature of this kind may be adjured in two ways. First, by way of appeal made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this relates to those who work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by calling on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: secondly, by way of compulsion, which relates to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who uses the irrational creature for our harm. This is the kind of adjuration used in the exorcisms of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whereby the power of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> is expelled from an irrational creature. But it is not lawful to adjure the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by beseeching them to help us.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.
