<h1>Question 91. The production of the first man's body</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1091.htm#article1"> The matter from which it was produced</a> <li><a href="../summa/1091.htm#article2"> The author by whom it was produced</a> <li><a href="../summa/1091.htm#article3"> The disposition it received in its production</a> <li><a href="../summa/1091.htm#article4"> The mode and order of its production</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the body of the first man was made of the slime of the earth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the body of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not made of the slime of the earth. For it is an act of greater power to make something out of nothing than out of something; because "not being" is farther off from actual <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> than "being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>." But since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the most honorable of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> lower creatures, it was fitting that in the production of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body, the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be most clearly shown. Therefore it should not have been made of the slime of the earth, but out of nothing.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the heavenly bodies are nobler than earthly bodies. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body has the greatest nobility; since it is perfected by the noblest form, which is the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore it should not be made of an earthly body, but of a heavenly body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fire and air are nobler than earth and water, as is clear from their subtlety. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is most noble, it should rather have been made of fire and air than of the slime of the earth.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is composed of the four elements. Therefore it was not made of the slime of the earth, but of the four elements.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse7">Genesis 2:7</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the slime of the earth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is perfect in His works, He bestowed perfection on all of them according to their capacity: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> works are perfect" (<a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>). He Himself is simply perfect by the fact that "all things are pre-contained" in Him, not as component parts, but as "united in one simple whole," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. v); in the same way as various effects pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, according to its one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. This perfection is bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, inasmuch as all things which are produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> through various forms come under their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> this perfection is bestowed in an inferior way. For he does not possess a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, but is in a manner composed of all things, since he has in himself a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the genus of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, and in likeness to the heavenly bodies he is removed from contraries by an equable temperament. As to the elements, he has them in their very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, yet in such a way that the higher elements, fire and air, predominate in him by their power; for life is mostly found where there is heat, which is from fire; and where there is humor, which is of the air. But the inferior elements abound in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; otherwise the mingling of elements would not be evenly balanced, unless the inferior elements, which have the less power, predominated in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Therefore the body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to have been formed from the slime of the earth; because earth and water mingled are called slime, and for this reason <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is called 'a little world,' because all creatures of the world are in a way to be found in him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The power of the Divine Creator was manifested in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body when its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was produced by creation. But it was fitting that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body should be made of the four elements, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might have something in common with the inferior bodies, as being something between <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the heavenly body is in itself nobler than the earthly body, yet for the acts of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the heavenly body is less adapted. For the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receives the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in a certain way through the senses, the organs of which cannot be formed of a heavenly body which is impassible. Nor is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that something of the fifth <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> enters materially into the composition of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, as some say, who suppose that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body by means of light. For, first of all, what they say is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>--that light is a body.

<p>Secondly, it is impossible for something to be taken from the fifth <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, or from a heavenly body, and to be mingled with the elements, since a heavenly body is impassible; wherefore it does not enter into the composition of mixed bodies, except as in the effects of its power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If fire and air, whose action is of greater power, predominated also in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, they would entirely draw the rest into themselves, and there would be no equality in the mingling, such as is required in the composition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for the sense of touch, which is the foundation of the other senses. For the organ of any particular sense must not actually have the contraries of which that sense has the perception, but only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>; either in such a way that it is entirely void of the whole "genus" of such contraries--thus, for instance, the pupil of the eye is without color, so as to be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> as regards all colors; which is not possible in the organ of touch, since it is composed of the very elements, the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of which are perceived by that sense--or so that the organ is a medium between two contraries, as much needs be the case with regard to touch; for the medium is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to the extremes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In the slime of the earth are earth, and water binding the earth together. Of the other elements, <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> makes no mention, because they are less in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, as we have said; and because also in the account of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">Creation</a> no mention is made of fire and air, which are not perceived by senses of uncultured men such as those to whom the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> was immediately addressed.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the human body was immediately produced by God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was not produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 4), that "corporeal things are disposed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was made of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore it was produced by the instrumentality of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and not immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever can be made by a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power, is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> produced immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body can be produced by the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power of a heavenly body; for even certain animals are produced from putrefaction by the active power of a heavenly body; and Albumazar says that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not generated where heat and cold are extreme, but only in temperate regions. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> produced immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing is made of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> except by some material change. But all corporeal change is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a movement of a heavenly body, which is the first movement. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was produced from corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it seems that a heavenly body had part in its production.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. vii, 24) that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body was made during the work of the six days, according to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> inserted in corporeal creatures; and that afterwards it was actually produced. But what pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the corporeal creature by reason of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can be produced by some corporeal body. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was produced by some <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power, and not immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir017.htm#verse1">Sirach 17:1</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> out of the earth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The first formation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body could not be by the instrumentality of any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power, but was immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Some, indeed, supposed that the forms which are in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are derived from some immaterial forms; but the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> refutes this opinion (Metaph. vii), for the reason that forms cannot be made in themselves, but only in the composite, as we have explained (65, 4); and because the agent must be like its effect, it is not fitting that a pure form, not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, should produce a form which is in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and which form is only made by the fact that the composite is made. So a form which is in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> can only be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another form that is in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, according as composite is made by composite. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though He is absolutely immaterial, can alone by His own power produce <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by creation: wherefore He alone can produce a form in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, without the aid of any preceding material form. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot transform a body except by making use of something in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a seed, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 19). Therefore as no pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> body has been formed whereby another body of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> could be generated, the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> made immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are the ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as regards what He does in bodies, yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does something in bodies beyond the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels'</a> power, as, for instance, raising the dead, or giving sight to the blind: and by this power He formed the body of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the slime of the earth. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> could act as ministers in the formation of the body of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in the same way as they will do at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">last resurrection</a> by collecting the dust.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Perfect animals, produced from seed, cannot be made by the sole power of a heavenly body, as <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a>; although the power of a heavenly body may assist by co-operation in the work of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii, 26), "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and the sun beget <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>." For this reason, a place of moderate temperature is required for the production of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and other animals. But the power of heavenly bodies suffices for the production of some imperfect animals from properly disposed <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: for it is clear that more <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are required to produce a perfect than an imperfect thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The movement of the heavens <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> changes; but not changes that surpass the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the Divine Power alone, as for the dead to be raised to life, or the blind to see: like to which also is the making of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the slime of the earth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> An effect may be said to pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of creatures, in two ways.

<p>First, both in active and in passive <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, so that not only can it be produced out of pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but also that some pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> creature can produce it.

<p>Secondly, in passive <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> only; that is, that out of pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> it can be produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In this sense, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body pre-existed in the previous work in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the body of man was given an apt disposition?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not given an apt disposition. For since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the noblest of animals, his body ought to be the best disposed in what is proper to an animal, that is, in sense and movement. But some animals have sharper senses and quicker movement than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; thus dogs have a keener smell, and birds a swifter flight. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body was not aptly disposed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, perfect is what lacks nothing. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body lacks more than the body of other animals, for these are provided with covering and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> arms of defense, in which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is lacking. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is very imperfectly disposed.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more distant from plants than he is from the brutes. But plants are erect in stature, while brutes are prone in stature. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not be of erect stature.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse30">Ecclesiastes 7:30</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> right."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things were produced by the Divine art, and so may be called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> works of art. Now every artist intends to give to his work the best disposition; not absolutely the best, but the best as regards the proposed end; and even if this entails some defect, the artist cares not: thus, for instance, when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes himself a saw for the purpose of cutting, he makes it of iron, which is suitable for the object in view; and he does not prefer to make it of glass, though this be a more beautiful material, because this very beauty would be an obstacle to the end he has in view. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave to each <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being the best disposition; not absolutely so, but in the view of its proper end. This is what the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii, 7): "And because it is better so, not absolutely, but for each one's <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>."

<p>Now the proximate end of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and its operations; since <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is for the sake of the form, and instruments are for the action of the agent. I say, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> fashioned the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body in that disposition which was best, as most suited to such a form and to such operations. If defect <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, it is well to observe that such defect arises as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> result of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> required in the body, in order to make it suitably proportioned to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and its operations.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sense of touch, which is the foundation of the other senses, is more perfect in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than in any other animal; and for this reason <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> must have the most equable temperament of all animals. Moreover <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> excels all other animals in the interior sensitive powers, as is clear from what we have said above (Question 78, Article 4). But by a kind of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> falls short of the other animals in some of the exterior senses; thus of all animals he has the least sense of smell. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs the largest brain as compared to the body; both for his greater freedom of action in the interior powers required for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operations, as we have seen above (Question 84, Article 7); and in order that the low temperature of the brain may modify the heat of the heart, which has to be considerable in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for him to be able to stand erect. So that size of the brain, by reason of its humidity, is an impediment to the smell, which requires dryness. In the same way, we may suggest a reason why some animals have a keener sight, and a more acute hearing than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; namely, on account of a hindrance to his senses arising <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> from the perfect equability of his temperament. The same reason suffices to explain why some animals are more rapid in movement than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since this excellence of speed is inconsistent with the equability of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> temperament.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Horns and claws, which are the weapons of some animals, and toughness of hide and <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of hair or feathers, which are the clothing of animals, are signs of an abundance of the earthly element; which does not agree with the equability and softness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> temperament. Therefore such things do not suit the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Instead of these, he has reason and hands whereby he can make himself arms and clothes, and other necessaries of life, of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> variety. Wherefore the hand is called by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Anima iii, 8), "the organ of organs." Moreover this was more becoming to the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is capable of conceiving an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of things, so as to make for itself an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of instruments.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An upright stature was becoming to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for four reasons.

<p>First, because the senses are given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not only for the purpose of procuring the necessaries of life, which they are bestowed on other animals, but also for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence, whereas the other animals take delight in the objects of the senses only as ordered to food and sex, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> alone takes pleasure in the beauty of sensible objects for its own sake. Therefore, as the senses are situated chiefly in the face, other animals have the face turned to the ground, as it were for the purpose of seeking food and procuring a livelihood; whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has his face erect, in order that by the senses, and chiefly by sight, which is more subtle and penetrates further into the differences of things, he may freely survey the sensible objects around him, both heavenly and earthly, so as to gather intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from all things.

<p>Secondly, for the greater freedom of the acts of the interior powers; the brain, wherein these actions are, in a way, performed, not being low down, but lifted up above other parts of the body.

<p>Thirdly, because if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> stature were prone to the ground he would need to use his hands as fore-feet; and thus their utility for other purposes would cease.

<p>Fourthly, because if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> stature were prone to the ground, and he used his hands as fore-feet, he would be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take hold of his food with his mouth. Thus he would have a protruding mouth, with thick and hard lips, and also a hard tongue, so as to keep it from being hurt by exterior things; as we see in other animals. Moreover, such an attitude would quite hinder speech, which is reason's proper operation.

<p>Nevertheless, though of erect stature, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is far above plants. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> superior part, his head, is turned towards the superior part of the world, and his inferior part is turned towards the inferior world; and therefore he is perfectly disposed as to the general situation of his body. Plants have the superior part turned towards the lower world, since their roots correspond to the mouth; and their inferior part towards the upper world. But brute animals have a middle disposition, for the superior part of the animal is that by which it takes food, and the inferior part that by which it rids itself of the surplus.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the production of the human body is fittingly described in Scripture?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the production of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is not fittingly described in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>. For, as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so also were the other works of the six days. But in the other works it is written, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said; Let it be made, and it was made." Therefore the same should have been said of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately, as explained above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore it was not fittingly said, "Let us make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the form of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself which is the breath of life. Therefore, having said, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the slime of the earth," he should not have added: "And He breathed into him the breath of life."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the breath of life, is in the whole body, and chiefly in the heart. Therefore it was not fittingly said: "He breathed into his face the breath of life."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the male and female sex belong to the body, while the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. vii, 24), was made before the body. Therefore having said: "To His image He made them," he should not have added, "male and female He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> them."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Is the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (Gen. ad lit. vi, 12), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> surpasses other things, not in the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as though He did not make other things; since it is written (<a href="../bible/psa101.htm#verse26">Psalm 101:26</a>), "The work of Thy hands is the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," and elsewhere (<a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse5">Psalm 94:5</a>), "His hands laid down the dry land"; but in this, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image. Yet in describing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> production, <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> uses a special way of speaking, to show that other things were made for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> sake. For we are accustomed to do with more deliberation and care what we have chiefly in mind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We must not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said "Let us make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," He spoke to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as some were perverse enough to think. But by these words is signified the plurality of the Divine Person, Whose image is more clearly expressed in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some have thought that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body was formed first in priority of time, and that afterwards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was infused into the formed body. But it is inconsistent with the perfection of the production of things, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should have made either the body without the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without the body, since each is a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This is especially unfitting as regards the body, for the body depends on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on the body.

<p>To remove the difficulty some have said that the words, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," must be understood of the production of the body with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and that the subsequent words, "and He breathed into his face the breath of life," should be understood of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; as the Lord breathed on His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, saying, "Receive ye the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John 20:22</a>). But this explanation, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiii, 24), is excluded by the very words of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>. For we read farther on, "And <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made a living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"; which words the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse45">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>) refers not to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, but to animal life. Therefore, by breath of life we must understand the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so that the words, "He breathed into his face the breath of life," are a sort of exposition of what goes before; for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the form of the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since vital operations are more clearly seen in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> face, on account of the senses which are there expressed; therefore <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> says that the breath of life was breathed into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> face.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. iv, 34), the works of the six days were done all at one time; wherefore according to him <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which he holds to have been made with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, was not made before the sixth day; but on the sixth day both the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made actually, and his body in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> elements. But other <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> hold that on the sixth day both body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were actually made.
