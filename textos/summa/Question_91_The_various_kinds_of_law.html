<ol><li><a href="../summa/2091.htm#article1"> Is there an eternal law?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2091.htm#article2"> Is there a natural law?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2091.htm#article3"> Is there a human law?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2091.htm#article4"> Is there a Divine law?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2091.htm#article5"> Is there one Divine law, or several?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2091.htm#article6"> Is there a law of sin?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is an eternal law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Because every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is imposed on someone. But there was not someone from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> on whom a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> could be imposed: since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone was from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, promulgation is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But promulgation could not be from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>: because there was no one to whom it could be promulgated from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> implies order to an end. But nothing ordained to an end is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>: for the last end alone is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 6): "That Law which is the Supreme <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> cannot be understood to be otherwise than unchangeable and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (90, 1, ad 2; A3,4), a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is nothing else but a dictate of practical reason emanating from the ruler who governs a perfect community. Now it is evident, granted that the world is ruled by Divine Providence, as was stated in the I, 22, A1,2, that the whole community of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is governed by Divine <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>. Wherefore the very Idea of the government of things in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Ruler of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. And since the Divine <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason's</a> conception of things is not subject to time but is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse23">Proverbs 8:23</a>, therefore it is that this kind of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> must be called <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those things that are not in themselves, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as they are foreknown and preordained by Him, according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse17">Romans 4:17</a>: "Who calls those things that are not, as those that are." Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> concept of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> bears the character of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in so far as it is ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the government of things foreknown by Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Promulgation is made by word of mouth or in writing; and in both ways the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is promulgated: because both the Divine Word and the writing of the Book of Life are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But the promulgation cannot be from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> on the part of the creature that hears or reads.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> implies order to the end actively, in so far as it directs certain things to the end; but not passively--that is to say, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> itself is not ordained to the end--except <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in a governor whose end is extrinsic to him, and to which end his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> must needs be ordained. But the end of the Divine government is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, and His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not distinct from Himself. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not ordained to another end.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there is in us a natural law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> in us. Because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is governed sufficiently by the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i) that "the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is that by which it is right that all things should be most orderly." But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not abound in superfluities as neither does she fail in necessaries. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed, in his acts, to the end, as stated above (Question 90, Article 2). But the directing of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> to their end is not a function of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as is the case in irrational creatures, which act for an end solely by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acts for an end by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and will. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more a man is free, the less is he under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is freer than all the animals, on account of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, with which he is endowed above all other animals. Since therefore other animals are not subject to a <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, neither is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> subject to a <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse14">Romans 2:14</a>: "When the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who have not the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, do by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> those things that are of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>," comments as follows: "Although they have no written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, yet they have the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, whereby each one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, and is conscious of, what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (90, 1, ad 1), <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, being a rule and measure, can be in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in two ways: in one way, as in him that rules and measures; in another way, as in that which is ruled and measured, since a thing is ruled and measured, in so far as it partakes of the rule or measure. Wherefore, since all things subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> are ruled and measured by the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as was stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>); it is evident that all things partake somewhat of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in so far as, namely, from its being imprinted on them, they derive their respective inclinations to their proper acts and ends. Now among all others, the rational creature is subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> in the most excellent way, in so far as it partakes of a share of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, by being provident both for itself and for others. Wherefore it has a share of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>, whereby it has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to its proper act and end: and this participation of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in the rational creature is called the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. Hence the Psalmist after saying (<a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse6">Psalm 4:6</a>): "Offer up the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," as though someone asked what the works of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> are, adds: "Many say, Who showeth us <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things?" in answer to which question he says: "The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us": thus implying that the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whereby we discern what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which is the function of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, is nothing else than an imprint on us of the Divine light. It is therefore evident that the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is nothing else than the rational creature's participation of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument would hold, if the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> were something different from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: whereas it is nothing but a participation thereof, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and will in us is based on that which is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (Question 10, Article 1): for every act of reasoning is based on principles that are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, and every act of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in respect of the means is derived from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in respect of the last end. Accordingly the first direction of our acts to their end must needs be in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even irrational animals partake in their own way of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>, just as the rational creature does. But because the rational creature partakes thereof in an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and rational manner, therefore the participation of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in the rational creature is properly called a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, since a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is something pertaining to reason, as stated above (Question 90, Article 1). Irrational creatures, however, do not partake thereof in a rational manner, wherefore there is no participation of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in them, except by way of similitude.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there is a human law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is a participation of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Now through the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> "all things are most orderly," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Lib. Arb. i, 6). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> suffices for the ordering of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. Consequently there is no need for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> bears the character of a measure, as stated above (Question 90, Article 1). But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is not a measure of things, but vice versa, as stated in Metaph. x, text. 5. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can emanate from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a measure should be most certain, as stated in Metaph. x, text. 3. But the dictates of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in matters of conduct are uncertain, according to <a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse14">Wisdom 9:14</a>: "The thoughts of mortal men are fearful, and our counsels uncertain." Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can emanate from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Lib. Arb. i, 6) distinguishes two kinds of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, the one <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, the other temporal, which he calls <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (90, 1, ad 2), a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is a dictate of the practical reason. Now it is to be observed that the same procedure takes place in the practical and in the speculative reason: for each proceeds from principles to conclusions, as stated above (De Lib. Arb. i, 6). Accordingly we conclude that just as, in the speculative reason, from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> indemonstrable principles, we draw the conclusions of the various <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which is not imparted to us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but acquired by the efforts of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, so too it is from the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, as from general and indemonstrable principles, that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> needs to proceed to the more particular determination of certain matters. These particular determinations, devised by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, are called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws, provided the other <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> be observed, as stated above (90, A2,3,4). Wherefore Tully says in his Rhetoric (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has its source in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thence certain things came into custom by reason of their utility; afterwards these things which emanated from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and were approved by custom, were sanctioned by fear and reverence for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> cannot have a full participation of the dictate of the Divine <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>, but according to its own mode, and imperfectly. Consequently, as on the part of the speculative reason, by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> participation of Divine Wisdom, there is in us the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of certain general principles, but not proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of each single <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, such as that contained in the Divine Wisdom; so too, on the part of the practical reason, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> participation of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, according to certain general principles, but not as regards the particular determinations of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> cases, which are, however, contained in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Hence the need for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> to proceed further to sanction them by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> reason is not, of itself, the rule of things: but the principles impressed on it by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, are general rules and measures of all things relating to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct, whereof the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is the rule and measure, although it is not the measure of things that are from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The practical reason is concerned with practical matters, which are singular and <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>: but not with <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things, with which the speculative reason is concerned. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws cannot have that inerrancy that belongs to the demonstrated conclusions of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for every measure to be altogether unerring and certain, but according as it is possible in its own particular genus.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there was any need for a Divine law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was no need for a <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Because, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is a participation in us of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is a <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore there was no need for a <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> in addition to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws derived therefrom.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse14">Sirach 15:14</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> left <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the hand of his own counsel." Now counsel is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated above (Question 14, Article 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was left to the direction of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. But a dictate of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore there is no need for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be governed also by a <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is more self-sufficing than irrational creatures. But irrational creatures have no <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> besides the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination impressed on them. Much less, therefore, should the rational creature have a <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> in addition to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> David <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to set His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> before him, saying (<a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse33">Psalm 118:33</a>): "Set before me for a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> the way of Thy justifications, O Lord."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Besides the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the directing of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct to have a <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. And this for four reasons. First, because it is by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed how to perform his proper acts in view of his last end. And indeed if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were ordained to no other end than that which is proportionate to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> faculty, there would be no need for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have any further direction of the part of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, besides the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which is derived from it. But since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ordained to an end of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which is inproportionate to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> faculty, as stated above (Question 5, Article 5), therefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that, besides the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be directed to his end by a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Secondly, because, on account of the uncertainty of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment, especially on contingent and particular matters, different people form different judgments on <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>; whence also different and contrary laws result. In order, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> what he ought to do and what he ought to avoid, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be directed in his proper acts by a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that such a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>.

<p>Thirdly, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can make laws in those matters of which he is competent to judge. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not competent to judge of interior movements, that are hidden, but only of exterior acts which appear: and yet for the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to conduct himself aright in both kinds of acts. Consequently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> could not sufficiently curb and direct interior acts; and it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for this purpose that a <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> should supervene.

<p>Fourthly, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5,6), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> cannot punish or forbid all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>: since while aiming at doing away with all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, it would do away with many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and would hinder the advance of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> intercourse. In order, therefore, that no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> might remain unforbidden and unpunished, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> to supervene, whereby all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forbidden.

<p>And these four <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are touched upon in <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse8">Psalm 118:8</a>, where it is said: "The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Lord is unspotted," i.e. allowing no foulness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; "converting <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>," because it directs not only exterior, but also interior acts; "the testimony of the Lord is faithful," because of the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and right; "giving wisdom to little ones," by directing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to an end <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> and Divine.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is participated proportionately to the capacity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But to his <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs to be directed in a yet higher way. Hence the additional <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shares more perfectly in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Counsel is a kind of inquiry: hence it must proceed from some principles. Nor is it enough for it to proceed from principles imparted by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which are the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, for the reasons given above: but there is need for certain additional principles, namely, the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Irrational creatures are not ordained to an end higher than that which is proportionate to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers: consequently the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether there is but one Divine law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is but one <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Because, where there is one king in one kingdom there is but one <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now the whole of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> is compared to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to one king, according to <a href="../bible/psa046.htm#verse8">Psalm 46:8</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the King of all the earth." Therefore there is but one <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is directed to the end which the lawgiver intends for those for whom he makes the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> intends one and the same thing for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; since according to <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 2:4</a>: "He will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved, and to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Therefore there is but one <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> seems to be more akin to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which is one, than the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, according as the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is of a higher order than <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore much more is the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> but one.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse12">Hebrews 7:12</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> being translated, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that a translation also be made of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is twofold, as stated in the same passage, viz. the levitical <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> is twofold, namely the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in the I, 30, 3, distinction is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of number. Now things may be distinguished in two ways. First, as those things that are altogether specifically different, e.g. a horse and an ox. Secondly, as perfect and imperfect in the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, e.g. a boy and a man: and in this way the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> is divided into Old and New. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse24">Galatians 3:24-25</a>) compares the state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> to that of a child "under a pedagogue"; but the state under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, to that of a full grown <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is "no longer under a pedagogue."

<p>Now the perfection and imperfection of these two laws is to be taken in connection with the three <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above. For, in the first place, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to be directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as to its end, as stated above (Question 90, Article 2). This <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may be twofold. It may be a sensible and earthly <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and to this, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was directly ordained by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>: wherefore, at the very outset of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, the people were invited to the earthly kingdom of the Chananaeans (<a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse8">Exodus 3:8-17</a>). Again it may be an intelligible and heavenly <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and to this, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ordained by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Wherefore, at the very beginning of His preaching, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> invited men to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, saying (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse17">Matthew 4:17</a>): "Do penance, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. iv) that "promises of temporal goods are contained in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, for which reason it is called old; but the promise of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>."

<p>Secondly, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to direct <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> according to the order of righteousness (4): wherein also the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> surpasses the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, since it directs our internal acts, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew 5:20</a>: "Unless your <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> abound more than that of the Scribes and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, you shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>." Hence the saying that "the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> restrains the hand, but the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> controls the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>" ( Sentent. iii, D, xl).

<p>Thirdly, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to induce men to observe its commandments. This the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did by the fear of punishment: but the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, by love, which is poured into our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, bestowed in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, but foreshadowed in the Old. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Adimant. Manich. discip. xvii) that "there is little difference [The 'little difference' refers to the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> words 'timor' and 'amor'--'fear' and 'love.'] between the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> and the Gospel--fear and love."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the father of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> issues different commands to the children and to the adults, so also the one King, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in His one kingdom, gave one <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, while they were yet imperfect, and another more perfect <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, when, by the preceding <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, they had been led to a greater capacity for Divine things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not be achieved otherwise than through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse12">Acts 4:12</a>: "There is no other name . . . given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whereby we must be saved." Consequently the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that brings all to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> could not be given until after the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But before His coming it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to give to the people, of whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to be born, a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> containing certain rudiments of righteousness unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, in order to prepare them to receive Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by way of certain general precepts, common to both the perfect and the imperfect: wherefore it is one and the same for all. But the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also in certain particular matters, to which the perfect and imperfect do not stand in the same relation. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> to be twofold, as already explained.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether there is a law in the fomes of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v) that the "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is based on reason." But the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not based on reason, but deviates from it. Therefore the "fomes" has not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is binding, so that those who do not obey it are called transgressors. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not called a transgressor, from not following the instigations of the "fomes"; but rather from his following them. Therefore the "fomes" has not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (Question 90, Article 2). But the "fomes" inclines us, not to the common, but to our own private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore the "fomes" has not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans 7:23</a>): "I see another <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in my members, fighting against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of my mind."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (2; 90, 1, ad 1), the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, resides in him that rules and measures; but, by way of participation, in that which is ruled and measured; so that every inclination or ordination which may be found in things subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, is called a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> by participation, as stated above (2; 90, 1, ad 1). Now those who are subject to a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> may receive a twofold inclination from the lawgiver. First, in so far as he directly inclines his subjects to something; sometimes indeed different subjects to different acts; in this way we may say that there is a military <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and a mercantile <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Secondly, indirectly; thus by the very fact that a lawgiver deprives a subject of some dignity, the latter passes into another order, so as to be under another <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as it were: thus if a soldier be turned out of the army, he becomes a subject of rural or of mercantile legislation.

<p>Accordingly under the Divine Lawgiver various creatures have various <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclinations, so that what is, as it were, a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for one, is against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for another: thus I might say that fierceness is, in a way, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of a dog, but against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of a sheep or another meek animal. And so the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which, by the Divine ordinance, is allotted to him, according to his proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, is that he should act in accordance with reason: and this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was so effective in the primitive state, that nothing either beside or against reason could take <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> unawares. But when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turned his back on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he fell under the influence of his sensual impulses: in fact this happens to each one individually, the more he deviates from the path of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, so that, after a fashion, he is likened to the beasts that are led by the impulse of sensuality, according to <a href="../bible/psa048.htm#verse21">Psalm 48:21</a>: "Man, when he was in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, did not understand: he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them."

<p>So, then, this very inclination of sensuality which is called the "fomes," in other animals has simply the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (yet only in so far as a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> may be said to be in such things), by reason of a direct inclination. But in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it has not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in this way, rather is it a deviation from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of reason. But since, by the just sentence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is destitute of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> bereft of its vigor, this impulse of sensuality, whereby he is led, in so far as it is a penalty following from the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> depriving <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of his proper dignity, has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers the "fomes" in itself, as an incentive to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. It is not thus that it has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above, but according as it results from the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>: it is as though we were to say that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> allows a nobleman to be condemned to hard labor for some misdeed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in the light of a rule or measure: for it is in this sense that those who deviate from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> become transgressors. But the "fomes" is not a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in this respect, but by a kind of participation, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers the "fomes" as to its proper inclination, and not as to its origin. And yet if the inclination of sensuality be considered as it is in other animals, thus it is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely, to the preservation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. And this is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also, in so far as sensuality is subject to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. But it is called "fomes" in so far as it strays from the order of reason.
