<h1>Question 92. Superstition</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3092.htm#article1"> Is superstition a vice opposed to religion?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3092.htm#article2"> Does it have several parts or species?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether superstition is a vice contrary to religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that superstition is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> contrary to religion. One contrary is not included in the definition of the other.

<p>But religion is included in the definition of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>: for the latter is defined as being "immoderate observance of religion," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse23">Colossians 2:23</a>, "Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>." Therefore superstition is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> contrary to religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x): "Cicero [De Natura Deorum ii, 28 states that the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> were so called because they spent the day in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> that their children might survive [superstites] them." But this may be done even in accordance with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religious worship. Therefore superstition is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to religion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, superstition seems to denote an excess. But religion admits of no excess, since, as stated above (81, 5, ad 3), there is no possibility of rendering to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by religion, the equal of what we owe Him. Therefore superstition is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> contrary to religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Decem Chord. Serm. ix): "Thou strikest the first chord in the worship of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the beast of superstition hath fallen." Now the worship of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs to religion. Therefore superstition is contrary to religion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 81, Article 5), religion is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes a mean, as stated above (I-II, 64, 1). Therefore a twofold <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is opposed to a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. One by way of excess, the other by way of deficiency. Again, the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be exceeded, not only with regard to the circumstance called "how much," but also with regard to other circumstances: so that, in certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> such as magnanimity and magnificence; <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> exceeds the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not through tending to something greater than the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but possibly to something less, and yet it goes beyond the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, through doing something to whom it ought not, or when it ought not, and in like manner as regards other circumstances, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> shows (Ethic. iv, 1,2,3).

<p>Accordingly superstition is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> contrary to religion by excess, not that it offers more to the divine worship than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, but because it offers divine worship either to whom it ought not, or in a manner it ought not.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as we speak metaphorically of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> among <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things--thus we speak of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>--so too sometimes the names of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are employed by transposition in an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> sense. Thus <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is sometimes used instead of cunning, according to <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse8">Luke 16:8</a>, "The children of this world are more <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'wiser'] in their generation than the children of light." It is in this way that superstition is described as religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The etymology of a word differs from its meaning. For its etymology depends on what it is taken from for the purpose of signification: whereas its meaning depends on the thing to which it is applied for the purpose of signifying it. Now these things differ sometimes: for "lapis" [a stone] takes its name from hurting the foot [laedere pedem], but this is not its meaning, else iron, since it hurts the foot, would be a stone. On like manner it does not follow that "<a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>" means that from which the word is derived.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Religion does not admit of excess, in respect of absolute <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but it does admit of excess in respect of proportionate <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, in so far, to wit, as something may be done in divine worship that ought not to be done.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there are various species of superstition?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are not various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Topic. i, 13), "if one contrary includes many kinds, so does the other." Now religion, to which superstition is contrary, does not include various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; but all its acts belong to the one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore neither has superstition various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, opposites relate to one same thing. But religion, to which superstition is opposed, relates to those things whereby we are directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (Question 81, Article 1). Therefore superstition, which is opposed to religion, is not specified according to divinations of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> occurrences, or by the observances of certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse23">Colossians 2:23</a>, "Which things have . . . a show of wisdom in superstition," adds: "that is to say in a hypocritical religion." Therefore hypocrisy should be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> assigns the various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of superstition (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 20).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against religion consist in going beyond the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in respect of certain circumstances (1). For as we have stated (I-II, 72, 09), not every diversity of corrupt circumstances differentiates the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only that which is referred to diverse objects, for diverse ends: since it is in this respect that moral acts are diversified specifically, as stated above (I-II, 01, 3; I-II, 18, 2,6).

<p>Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of superstition are differentiated, first on the part of the mode, secondly on the part of the object. For the divine worship may be given either to whom it ought to be given, namely, to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but "in an undue mode," and this is the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>; or to whom it ought not to be given, namely, to any creature whatsoever, and this is another genus of superstition, divided into many <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in respect of the various ends of divine worship. For the end of divine worship is in the first place to give reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in this respect the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of this genus is "<a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>," which unduly gives divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to a creature. The second end of religion is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be taught by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whom he worships; and to this must be referred "divinatory" superstition, which consults the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> through compacts made with them, whether tacit or explicit. Thirdly, the end of divine worship is a certain direction of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> according to the precepts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the object of that worship: and to this must be referred the superstition of certain "observances."

<p><a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> alludes to these three (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 20), where he says that "anything invented by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for making and worshipping <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> is <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>," and this refers to the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Then he goes on to say, "or any agreement or covenant made with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> for the purpose of consultation and of compact by tokens," which refers to the second <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and a little further on he adds: "To this kind belong all sorts of amulets and such like," and this refers to the third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv), "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> results from a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that is one and entire, whereas <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arises from each single defect." Wherefore several <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (1; 10, 5). The saying of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of opposites wherein there is the same reason of multiplicity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Divinations and certain observances come under the head of superstition, in so far as they depend on certain actions of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>: and thus they pertain to compacts made with them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hypocritical religion is taken here for "religion as applied to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> observances," as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> goes on to explain. Wherefore this hypocritical religion is nothing else than worship given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in an undue mode: as, for instance, if a man were, in the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to wish to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to the rite of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. It is of religion taken in this sense that the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> speaks literally.
