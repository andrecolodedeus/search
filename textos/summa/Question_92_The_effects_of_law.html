<h1>Question 92. The effects of law</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2092.htm#article1"> Is an effect of law to make men good?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2092.htm#article2"> Are the effects of law to command, to forbid, to permit, and to punish, as the Jurist states?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether an effect of law is to make men good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it is not an effect of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to make men <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For men are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> through <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated in Ethic. ii, 6 is "that which makes its subject <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, because He it is Who "works it in us without us," as we stated above (Question 55, Article 4) in giving the definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not make men <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Law does not profit a man unless he obeys it. But the very fact that a man obeys a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is due to his being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is presupposed to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not make men <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Law is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (Question 90, Article 2). But some behave well in things regarding the community, who behave ill in things regarding themselves. Therefore it is not the business of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to make men <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, some laws are tyrannical, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. iii, 6). But a tyrant does not intend the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his subjects, but considers only his own profit. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not make men <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 1) that the "<a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of every lawgiver is to make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> citizens."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> as stated above (90, 1, ad 2; A3,4), a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is nothing else than a dictate of reason in the ruler by whom his subjects are governed. Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of any subordinate thing consists in its being well subordinated to that by which it is regulated: thus we see that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculties consists in their being obedient to reason; and accordingly "the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of every subject consists in his being well subjected to his ruler," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i). But every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> aims at being obeyed by those who are subject to it. Consequently it is evident that the proper effect of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is to lead its subjects to their proper <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is "that which makes its subject <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," it follows that the proper effect of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is to make those to whom it is given, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, either simply or in some particular respect. For if the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver is fixed on <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> regulated according to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, it follows that the effect of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is to make men <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver is fixed on that which is not simply <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but useful or pleasurable to himself, or in opposition to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; then the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not make men <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, but in respect to that particular government. In this way <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is found even in things that are bad of themselves: thus a man is called a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> robber, because he works in a way that is adapted to his end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Virtue is twofold, as explained above (Question 63, Article 2), viz. acquired and infused. Now the fact of being accustomed to an action contributes to both, but in different ways; for it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; while it disposes to infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and preserves and fosters it when it already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. And since <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is given for the purpose of directing <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>; as far as <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> conduce to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so far does <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> make men <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in the second book of the Politics (Ethic. ii) that "lawgivers make men <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by habituating them to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not always through perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that one obeys the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but sometimes it is through fear of punishment, and sometimes from the mere dictates of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which is a beginning of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (Question 63, Article 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of any part is considered in comparison with the whole; hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iii) that "unseemly is the part that harmonizes not with the whole." Since then every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a part of the state, it is impossible that a man be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, unless he be well proportionate to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: nor can the whole be well consistent unless its parts be proportionate to it. Consequently the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the state cannot flourish, unless the citizens be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, at least those whose business it is to govern. But it is enough for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the community, that the other citizens be so far <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> that they obey the commands of their rulers. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. ii, 2) that "the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a sovereign is the same as that of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of any common citizen is not the same as that of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A tyrannical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, through not being according to reason, is not a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, absolutely speaking, but rather a perversion of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; and yet in so far as it is something in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, it aims at the citizens' being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For all it has in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> consists in its being an ordinance made by a superior to his subjects, and aims at being obeyed by them, which is to make them <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not simply, but with respect to that particular government.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the acts of law are suitably assigned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the acts of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are not suitably assigned as consisting in "command," "prohibition," "permission" and "punishment." For "every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is a general precept," as the jurist states. But command and precept are the same. Therefore the other three are superfluous.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the effect of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is to induce its subjects to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But counsel aims at a higher <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than a command does. Therefore it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to counsel rather than to command.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as punishment stirs a man to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, so does reward. Therefore if to punish is reckoned an effect of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, so also is to reward.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of a lawgiver is to make men <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But he that obeys the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, merely through fear of being punished, is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: because "although a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> may be done through servile fear, i.e. fear of punishment, it is not done well," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra duas Epist. Pelag. ii). Therefore punishment is not a proper effect of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 19): "Every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> either permits something, as: 'A brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may demand his reward'": or forbids something, as: "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may ask a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in marriage": or punishes, as: "Let him that commits a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> be put to death."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as an assertion is a dictate of reason asserting something, so is a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> a dictate of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, commanding something. Now it is proper to reason to lead from one thing to another. Wherefore just as, in demonstrative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, the reason leads us from certain principles to assent to the conclusion, so it induces us by some means to assent to the precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p>Now the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are concerned with <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> directs, as stated above (90, A1,2; 91, 4). Again there are three kinds of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>: for, as stated above (Question 18, Article 8), some acts are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> generically, viz. acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and in respect of these the act of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is a precept or command, for "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> commands all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" (Ethic. v, 1). Some acts are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> generically, viz. acts of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and in respect of these the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> forbids. Some acts are generically indifferent, and in respect of these the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> permits; and all acts that are either not distinctly <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or not distinctly bad may be called indifferent. And it is the fear of punishment that <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> makes use of in order to ensure obedience: in which respect punishment is an effect of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as to cease from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so a prohibition is a kind of precept: and accordingly, taking precept in a wide sense, every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is a kind of precept.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To advise is not a proper act of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but may be within the competency even of a private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, who cannot make a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Wherefore too the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, after giving a certain counsel (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 7:12</a>) says: "I speak, not the Lord." Consequently it is not reckoned as an effect of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To reward may also pertain to anyone: but to punish pertains to none but the framer of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, by whose authority the pain is inflicted. Wherefore to reward is not reckoned an effect of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but only to punish.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> From becoming accustomed to avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and fulfill what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, through fear of punishment, one is sometimes led on to do so likewise, with delight and of one's own accord. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, even by punishing, leads men on to being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.
