<h1>Question 92. The production of the woman</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1092.htm#article1"> Should the woman have been made in that first production of things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1092.htm#article2"> Should the woman have been made from man?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1092.htm#article3"> Of man's rib?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1092.htm#article4"> Was the woman made immediately by God?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the woman should have been made in the first production of things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should not have been made in the first production of things. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Gener. ii, 3), that "the female is a misbegotten male." But nothing misbegotten or defective should have been in the first production of things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should not have been made at that first production.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, subjection and limitation were a result of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was it said after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis 3:16</a>): "Thou shalt be under the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power"; and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says that, "Where there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there is no inequality." But <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> of less strength and dignity than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; "for the agent is always more honorable than the patient," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16). Therefore <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should not have been made in the first production of things before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, occasions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should be cut off. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foresaw that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> would be an occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore He should not have made <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse18">Genesis 2:18</a>): "It is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be alone; let us make him a helper like to himself."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to be made, as the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> says, as a "helper" to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; not, indeed, as a helpmate in other works, as some say, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be more efficiently helped by another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in other works; but as a helper in the work of generation. This can be made clear if we observe the mode of generation carried out in various living things. Some living things do not possess in themselves the power of generation, but are generated by some other specific agent, such as some plants and animals by the influence of the heavenly bodies, from some fitting <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and not from seed: others possess the active and passive generative power together; as we see in plants which are generated from seed; for the noblest vital function in plants is generation. Wherefore we observe that in these the active power of generation invariably accompanies the passive power. Among perfect animals the active power of generation belongs to the male sex, and the passive power to the female. And as among animals there is a vital operation nobler than generation, to which their life is principally directed; therefore the male sex is not found in continual union with the female in perfect animals, but only at the time of coition; so that we may consider that by this means the male and female are one, as in plants they are always united; although in some cases one of them preponderates, and in some the other. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is yet further ordered to a still nobler vital action, and that is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation. Therefore there was greater reason for the distinction of these two forces in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; so that the female should be produced separately from the male; although they are carnally united for generation. Therefore directly after the formation of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, it was said: "And they shall be two in one flesh" (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis 2:24</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As regards the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is defective and misbegotten, for the active force in the male seed tends to the production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex; while the production of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> comes from defect in the active force or from some material indisposition, or even from some external influence; such as that of a south wind, which is moist, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (De Gener. Animal. iv, 2). On the other hand, as regards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in general, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is not misbegotten, but is included in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> as directed to the work of generation. Now the general <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> depends on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the universal Author of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore, in producing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> formed not only the male but also the female.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Subjection is twofold. One is servile, by virtue of which a superior makes use of a subject for his own benefit; and this kind of subjection began after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. There is another kind of subjection which is called economic or civil, whereby the superior makes use of his subjects for their own benefit and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and this kind of subjection <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> even before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> order would have been wanting in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> if some were not governed by others wiser than themselves. So by such a kind of subjection <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the discretion of reason predominates. Nor is inequality among men excluded by the state of innocence, as we shall <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> (96, 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had deprived the world of all those things which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> an occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> would have been imperfect. Nor was it fitting for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be destroyed in order that <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> might be avoided; especially as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is so powerful that He can direct any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether woman should have been made from man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should not have been made from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For sex belongs both to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and animals. But in the other animals the female was not made from the male. Therefore neither should it have been so with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, things of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are of the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But male and female are of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made of the slime of the earth, so <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should have been made of the same, and not from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was made to be a helpmate to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the work of generation. But close relationship makes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> unfit for that office; hence near relations are debarred from intermarriage, as is written (<a href="../bible/lev018.htm#verse6">Leviticus 18:6</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should not have been made from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir017.htm#verse5">Sirach 17:5</a>): "He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> of him," that is, out of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, "a helpmate like to himself," that is, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When all things were first formed, it was more suitable for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to be made from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that (for the female to be from the male) in other animals.

<p>First, in order thus to give the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a certain dignity consisting in this, that as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the principle of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, so the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was the principle of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> from one" (<a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse26">Acts 17:26</a>).

<p>Secondly, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might love <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> all the more, and cleave to her more closely, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> her to be fashioned from himself. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse23">Genesis 2:23-24</a>): "She was taken out of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife." This was most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as regards the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, in which the male and female live together for life; which is not the case with other animals.

<p>Thirdly, because, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 12), the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> male and female are united, not only for generation, as with other animals, but also for the purpose of domestic life, in which each has his or her particular <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, and in which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the head of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Wherefore it was suitable for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to be made out of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as out of her principle.

<p>Fourthly, there is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> reason for this. For by this is signified that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> takes her origin from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse32">Ephesians 5:32</a>): "This is a great <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; but I speak in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1</strong> is clear from the foregoing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Matter is that from which something is made. Now <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has a determinate principle; and since it is determined to one thing, it has also a determinate mode of proceeding. Wherefore from determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> it produces something in a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. On the other hand, the Divine Power, being <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, can produce things of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> out of any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, such as a man from the slime of the earth, and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from out of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A certain affinity arises from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation, and this is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. Woman, however, was not produced from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation, but by the Divine Power alone. Wherefore Eve is not called the daughter of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>; and so this argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the woman was fittingly made from the rib of man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should not have been formed from the rib of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For the rib was much smaller than the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> body. Now from a smaller thing a larger thing can be made only--either by addition (and then the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> ought to have been described as made out of that which was added, rather than out of the rib itself)--or by rarefaction, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. x): "A body cannot increase in bulk except by rarefaction." But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> body is not more rarefied than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>--at least, not in the proportion of a rib to Eve's body. Therefore Eve was not formed from a rib of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in those things which were first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> there was nothing superfluous. Therefore a rib of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> belonged to the integrity of his body. So, if a rib was removed, his body remained imperfect; which is unreasonable to suppose.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a rib cannot be removed from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without pain. But there was no pain before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it was not right for a rib to be taken from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that Eve might be made from it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse22">Genesis 2:22</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> built the rib, which He took from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, into a woman."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was right for the woman to be made from a rib of man.

<p>First, to signify the social union of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should neither "use authority over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," and so she was not made from his head; nor was it right for her to be subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> contempt as his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, and so she was not made from his feet.

<p>Secondly, for the sacramental signification; for from the side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> sleeping on the Cross the Sacraments flowed--namely, blood and water--on which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was established.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some say that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> body was formed by a material increase, without anything being added; in the same way as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> multiplied the five loaves. But this is quite impossible. For such an increase of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> would either be by a change of the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> itself, or by a change of its dimensions. Not by change of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, both because <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, considered in itself, is quite unchangeable, since it has a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and has nothing but the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a subject, and because <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> and size are extraneous to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> itself. Wherefore multiplication of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is quite unintelligible, as long as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> itself remains the same without anything added to it; unless it receives greater dimensions. This implies rarefaction, which is for the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to receive greater dimensions, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. iv). To say, therefore, that the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is enlarged, without being rarefied, is to combine contradictories --viz. the definition with the absence of the thing defined.

<p>Wherefore, as no rarefaction is apparent in such multiplication of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, we must admit an addition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: either by creation, or which is more probable, by conversion. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxiv in Joan.) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> filled five thousand men with five loaves, in the same way as from a few seeds He produces the harvest of corn"--that is, by transformation of the nourishment. Nevertheless, we say that the crowds were fed with five loaves, or that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was made from the rib, because an addition was made to the already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the loaves and of the rib.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The rib belonged to the integral perfection of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, not as an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but as the principle of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; just as the semen belongs to the perfection of the begetter, and is released by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and pleasurable operation. Much more, therefore, was it possible that by the Divine power the body of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should be produced from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> rib.

<p>From this it is clear how to answer the third objection.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the woman was formed immediately by God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was not formed immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is produced immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from another <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> alike in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was made from a man who is of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore she was not made immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. iii, 4) says that corporeal things are governed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> body was formed from corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore it was made through the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and not immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, those things which pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in creatures as to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are produced by the power of some creature, and not immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> body was produced in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> among the first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> works, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 15). Therefore it was not produced immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, in the same work: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, to Whom all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> owes its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, could form or build up the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> rib."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (2, ad 2), the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation of every <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is from some determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> whence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> begotten is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> semen of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Wherefore from any other <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> be generated. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, the Author of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, can produce an effect into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> outside the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone could produce either a man from the slime of the earth, or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from the rib of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument is verified when an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is begotten, by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation, from that which is like it in the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 15), we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were employed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the formation of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; but it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that, as the body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not formed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> from the slime of the earth, so neither was the body of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> formed by them from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> rib.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 18): "The first creation of things did not demand that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should be made thus; it made it possible for her to be thus made." Therefore the body of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> did indeed pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in these <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in the things first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>; not as regards active <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, but as regards a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> passive in relation to the active <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>.
