<h1>Question 92. The vision of the divine essence in reference to the blessed</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5092.htm#article1"> Will the saints see God in His essence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5092.htm#article2"> Will they see Him with the eyes of the body?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5092.htm#article3"> In seeing God, will they see all that God sees?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the human intellect can attain to the vision of God in His essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot attain to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John 1:18</a>): "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at any time"; and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> in his commentary says (Hom. xiv in Joan.) that "not even the heavenly <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a>, namely the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a> and <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>, have ever been able to see Him as He is." Now, only equality with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is promised to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>): "They . . . shall be as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Therefore neither will the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> argues thus (Div. Nom. i): "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> is only of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things." Now whatever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> is finite, since it is confined to a certain genus: and therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, is above all <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him, and He is above all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (De Myst. Theol. i) shows that the most perfect way in which our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is when it is united to Him as to something unknown. Now that which is seen in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not unknown. Therefore it is impossible for our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Ep. ad Caium Monach.) that "the darkness"--for thus he calls the abundance of light--"which screens <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is impervious to all illuminations, and hidden from all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: and if anyone in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understood what he saw, he saw not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, but one of those things that are His." Therefore no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will be able to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Ep. ad Hieroth.) "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is invisible on account of His surpassing <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Now His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> surpasses the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> even as on the way. Therefore since He is invisible on the way, so will He be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, since the intelligible object is the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, there must needs be proportion between intelligible and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as between the visible object and the sight. But there is no possible proportion between our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, since an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> distance separates them. Therefore our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will be unable to attain to the vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more distant from our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> than the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> intelligible is from our senses. But the senses can nowise attain to the sight of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature. Therefore neither will our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> be able to attain to the vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, whenever the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands something actually it needs to be informed with the likeness of the object understood, which likeness is the principle of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation terminating in that object, even as heat is the principle of heating. Accordingly if our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this must be by means of some likeness informing the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself. Now this cannot be the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since form and thing informed must needs have one being, while the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> differs from our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and being. Therefore the form whereby our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is informed in understanding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must needs be a likeness impressed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But this likeness, being something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, cannot lead to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> except as an effect leads to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore it is impossible for our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> except through His effect. But to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His effect is not to see Him in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will be unable to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is more distant from our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> than any <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>. Now according to <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> (Metaph. iii), "the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not imply that its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>," because in that case our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> would be a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and not an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, "but that its likeness is impressed on our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>." Therefore neither is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, to be understood by us, except in so far as an impression of Him is in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But this impression cannot lead to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, for since it is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> distant from the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it degenerates to another image much more than if the image of a white thing were to degenerate to the image of a black thing. Therefore, just as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in whose sight the image of a white thing degenerates to the image of a black thing, on account of an indisposition in the organ, is not said to see a white thing, so neither will our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> be able to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, since it understands <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only by means of this impression.

<p><strong>Objection 10.</strong> Further, "In things devoid of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> that which understands is the same as that which is understood" (De Anima iii). Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely devoid of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Since then our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, cannot attain to be an uncreated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it is impossible for our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 11.</strong> Further, whatever is seen in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as to what it is. But our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> what He is, but only what He is not as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. ii) and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. i) declare. Therefore our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will be unable to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 12.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> thing, as such, is unknown. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in every way <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore He is altogether unknown. Therefore it will be impossible for Him to be seen in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> by a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 13.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Videndo Deo: Ep. cxlvii): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> invisible." Now that which is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be otherwise. Therefore it is impossible for Him to be seen in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 14.</strong> Further, whatever is in one way and is seen in another way is not seen as it is. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in one way and will be seen in another way by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: for He according to His own mode, but will be seen by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> according to their mode. Therefore He will not be seen by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as He is, and thus will not be seen in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 15.</strong> Further, that which is seen through a medium is not seen in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be seen in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> through a medium which is the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse10">Psalm 35:10</a>, "In Thy light we shall see light." Therefore He will not be seen in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 16.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">seen face to face</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>. Now when we see a man face to face, we see him through his likeness. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be seen through His likeness, and consequently not in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>): "We see now through a glass in a dark manner, but then face to face." Now that which is seen face to face is seen in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be seen in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1 John 3:2</a>): "When He shall appear we shall be like to Him, because we shall see Him as He is." Therefore we shall see Him in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p>Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>, "When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Father," says: "Where," i.e. in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall be seen: this is given to the clean of heart alone and is the highest bliss." Therefore the blessed will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse21">John 14:21</a>): "He that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father; and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him." Now that which is manifested is seen in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be seen in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> commenting (Moral. xviii) on the words of <a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse20">Exodus 33:20</a>, "Man shall not see Me and live," disapproves of the opinion of those who said that "in this abode of bliss <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be seen in His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> but not in His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> differs not from His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." But His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore He will be seen in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p>Further, the desire of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> cannot be altogether frustrated. Now the common desire of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, according to <a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse13">Exodus 33:13</a>, "Show me Thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>"; <a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse20">Psalm 79:20</a>, "Show Thy face and we shall be saved"; and <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse8">John 14:8</a>, "Show us the Father and it is enough for us." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Even as we hold by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life is to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> maintained that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ultimate <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is to understand immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> according to their being. Hence in reference to this question we find that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and theologians encounter the same difficulty and the same difference of opinion. For some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> held that our passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can never come to understand separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. thus Alfarabius expresses himself at the end of his Ethics, although he says the contrary in his book On the Intelligence, as the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> attests (De Anima iii). In like manner certain theologians held that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can never attain to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. on either side they were moved by the distance which separates our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and from separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. For since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act is somewhat one with the intelligible object in act, it would seem difficult to understand how the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is made to be an uncreated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xiv in Joan.): "How can the creature see the uncreated?" Those who hold the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to be the subject of generation and corruption, as being a power dependent on the body, encounter a still greater difficulty not only as regards the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> but also as regards the vision of any separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. But this opinion is altogether untenable. First, because it is in contradiction to the authority of canonical scripture, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Videndo Deo: Ep. cxlvii). Secondly, because, since understanding is an operation most proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it follows that his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> must be held to consist in that operation when perfected in him. Now since the perfection of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> being as such is the intelligible object, if in the most perfect operation of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not attain to the vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but to something else, we shall be forced to conclude that something other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the object of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: and since the ultimate perfection of a thing consists in its being united to its principle, it follows that something other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the effective principle of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which is absurd, according to us, and also according to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who maintain that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> emanate from the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, so that finally we may be able to understand these <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Consequently, according to us, it must be asserted that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will at length attain to the vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and according to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, that it will attain to the vision of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p>It remains, then, to examine how this may come about. For some, like Alfarabius and <a href="../cathen/02150a.htm">Avempace</a>, held that from the very fact that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands any intelligible objects whatever, it attains to the vision of a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. To <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> this they employ two arguments. The first is that just as the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not diversified in various <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, except as united to various individuating principles, so the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> understood is not diversified in me and you, except in so far as it is united to various <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> forms: and consequently when the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> separates the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> understood from the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> forms, there remains a quiddity understood, which is one and the same in the various <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> understanding it, and such is the quiddity of a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Hence, when our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> attains to the supreme abstraction of any intelligible quiddity, it thereby understands the quiddity of the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> that is similar to it. The second argument is that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to abstract the quiddity from all intelligible objects having a quiddity. If, then, the quiddity which it abstracts from some particular <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> be a quiddity without a quiddity, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by understanding it understands the quiddity of the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> which has a like disposition, since separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are subsisting quiddities without quiddities; for the quiddity of a simple thing is the simple thing itself, as <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> says (Met. iii). On the other hand if the quiddity abstracted from this particular sensible be a quiddity that has a quiddity, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to abstract this quiddity, and consequently since we cannot go on indefinitely, we shall come to some quiddity without a quiddity, and this is what we understand by a separate quiddity [Cf. I, 88, 2].

<p>But this reasoning is seemingly inconclusive. First, because the quiddity of the material <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> abstracts, is not of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as the quiddity of the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, and consequently from the fact that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> abstracts the quiddities of material <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them, it does not follow that it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the quiddity of a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, especially of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which more than any other is of a different <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> quiddity. Secondly, because granted that it be of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a composite thing would not lead to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, except in the point of the most remote genus, namely <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>: and such a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is imperfect unless it reach to the properties of a thing. For to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a man only as an animal is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him only in a restricted sense and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>: and much less is it to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in him. Hence to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> thus, or other separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, is not to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or the quiddity of a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him in His effect and in a mirror as it were. For this reason <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> in his Metaphysics. propounds another way of understanding separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, to wit that separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are understood by us by means of intentions of their quiddities, such intentions being images of their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, not indeed abstracted therefrom, since they are immaterial, but impressed thereby on our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. But this way also seems inadequate to the Divine vision which we seek. For it is agreed that "whatever is received into any thing is therein after the mode of the recipient": and consequently the likeness of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> impressed on our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will be according to the mode of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: and the mode of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> falls short of a perfect reception of the Divine likeness. Now the lack of perfect likeness may occur in as many ways, as unlikeness may occur. For in one way there is a deficient likeness, when the form is participated according to the same specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but not in the same measure of perfection: such is the defective likeness in a subject that has little whiteness in comparison with one that has much. In another way the likeness is yet more defective, when it does not attain to the same specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but only to the same generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: such is the likeness of an orange-colored or yellowish object in comparison with a white one. In another way, still more defective is the likeness when it does not attain to the same generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but only to a certain analogy or proportion: such is the likeness of whiteness to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in that each is a being: and in this way every likeness received into a creature is defective in comparison with the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now in order that the sight <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whiteness, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for it to receive the likeness of whiteness according to its specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, although not according to the same manner of being because the form has a manner of being in the sense other from that which it has in the thing outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for if the form of yellowness were received into the eye, the eye would not be said to see whiteness. In like manner in order that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understand a quiddity, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for it to receive its likeness according to the same specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, although there may possibly not be the same manner of being on either side: for the form which is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or sense is not the principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> according to its manner of being on both sides, but according to its common ratio with the external object. Hence it is clear that by no likeness received in the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be understood, so that His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> be seen immediately. And for this reason those who held the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> to be seen in this way alone, said that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself will not be seen, but a certain brightness, as it were a radiance thereof. Consequently neither does this way suffice for the Divine vision that we seek.

<p>Therefore we must take the other way, which also certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> held, namely Alexander and <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a> (De Anima iii.). For since in every <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> some form is required whereby the object is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> or seen, this form by which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is perfected so as to see separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> is neither a quiddity abstracted by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from composite things, as the first opinion maintained, nor an impression left on our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as the second opinion affirmed; but the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> itself united to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, so as to be both that which is understood, and that whereby it is understood. And whatever may be the case with other separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, we must nevertheless allow this to be our way of seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, because by whatever other form our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were informed, it could not be led thereby to the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. This, however, must not be understood as though the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> were in reality the form of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, or as though from its conjunction with our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> there resulted one being simply, as in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: but the meaning is that the proportion of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is as the proportion of form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For whenever two things, one of which is the perfection of the other, are received into the same recipient, the proportion of one to the other, namely of the more perfect to the less perfect, is as the proportion of form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: thus light and color are received into a transparent object, light being to color as form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. When therefore <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light is received into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, together with the indwelling Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, though they are not received in the same way, the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> will be to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: and that this suffices for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to be able to see the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> by the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself may be shown as follows.

<p>As from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form (whereby a thing has being) and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, there results one thing simply, so from the form whereby the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself, there results one thing intelligibly. Now in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things a self-subsistent thing cannot be the form of any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, if that thing has <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as one of its parts, since it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to be the form of a thing. But if this self-subsistent thing be a mere form, nothing hinders it from being the form of some <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and becoming that whereby the composite itself is [Literally,--and becoming the 'whereby-it-is' of the composite itself] as instanced in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> we must take the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as form; so that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> actually understanding will be the composite as it were resulting from both. Hence if there be a self-subsistent thing, that has nothing in itself besides that which is intelligible, such a thing can by itself be the form whereby the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands. Now a thing is intelligible in respect of its <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> and not of its <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> (Met. ix): in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which an intelligible form needs to be abstracted from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and from all the properties of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore, since the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>, it will be possible for it to be the form whereby the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands: and this will be the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. ii, D, 1) that the union of the body with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is an illustration of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">blissful</a> union of the spirit with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words quoted can be explained in three ways, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Videndo Deo: Ep. cxlvii). In one way as excluding corporeal vision, whereby no one ever saw or will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; secondly, as excluding intellectual vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> from those who dwell in this mortal flesh; thirdly, as excluding the vision of comprehension from a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. It is thus that <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> understands the saying wherefore he adds: "By seeing, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> means a most clear perception, and such a comprehension as the Father has of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>." This also is the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, since he adds: "The Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> Who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him": his intention being to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from His comprehending <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, surpasses all <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things which have a determinate being, so His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, is above all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Wherefore as our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is to our <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so is the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now two things contribute to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, to wit, the knower and the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Again, the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision</a> whereby we shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the same whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees Himself, as regards that whereby He is seen, because as He sees Himself in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> so shall we also see Him. But as regards the knower there is the difference that is between the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and ours. Now in the order of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> follows the form by which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, since by the form of a stone we see a stone: whereas the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> follows the power of the knower: thus he who has stronger sight sees more clearly. Consequently in that <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision</a> we shall see the same thing that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees, namely His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but not so effectively.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> is speaking there of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby wayfarers <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> form, whereby our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is informed so as to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Videndo Deo: Ep. cxlvii), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> evades every form of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>," because whatever form our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> conceive, that form is out of proportion to the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Hence He cannot be fathomed by our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: but our most perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him as wayfarers is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He is above all that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can conceive, and thus we are united to Him as to something unknown. In heaven, however, we shall see Him by a form which is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and we shall be united to Him as to something <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is light (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John 1:9</a>). Now illumination is the impression of light on an illuminated object. And since the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is of a different mode from any likeness thereof impressed on the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, he (<a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>) says that the "Divine darkness is impervious to all illumination," because, to wit, the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which he calls "darkness" on account of its surpassing brightness, remains undemonstrated by the impression on our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and consequently is "hidden from all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Therefore if anyone in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> conceives something in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, this is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but one of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> effects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> surpasses any form by which our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is informed now, it does not surpass the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which will be the form of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and therefore although it is invisible now, it will be visible then.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Although there can be no proportion between finite and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, since the excess of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> over the finite is indeterminate, there can be proportionateness or a likeness to proportion between them: for as a finite thing is equal to some finite thing, so is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> thing equal to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> thing. Now in order that a thing be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> totally, it is sometimes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that there be proportion between knower and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, because the power of the knower needs to be adequate to the knowableness of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and equality is a kind of proportion. Sometimes, however, the knowableness of the thing surpasses the power of the knower, as when we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or conversely when He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> creatures: and then there is no need for proportion between knower and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but only for proportionateness; so that, to wit, as the knower is to the knowable object, so is the knowable object to the fact of its being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: and this proportionateness suffices for the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the finite, or conversely.

<p>We may also reply that proportion according to the strict sense in which it is employed signifies a ratio of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> based on a certain fixed excess or equality; but is further transferred to denote any ratio of any one thing to another; and in this sense we say that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> should be proportionate to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. In this sense nothing hinders our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, although finite, being described as proportionate to the vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; but not to the comprehension thereof, on account of its immensity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> Likeness and distance are twofold. One is according to agreement in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more distant from the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> than the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> intelligible is from the sense. The other is according to proportionateness; and thus it is the other way about, for sense is not proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the immaterial, as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of any immaterial object whatsoever. It is this likeness and not the former that is requisite for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, for it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understanding a stone is not like it in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being; thus also the sight apprehends red honey and red gall, though it does not apprehend sweet honey, for the redness of gall is more becoming to honey as visible, than the sweetness of honey to honey.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> In the vision wherein <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be seen in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself will be the form, as it were, of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by which it will understand: nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for them to become one in being, but only to become one as regards the act of understanding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> We do not uphold the saying of <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> as regards the point at issue, for in this other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> also disagree with him. Unless perhaps we might say that <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> refers to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and the likeness of other things. Hence he makes this statement in order to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that in us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> but an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Nevertheless, although the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is more distant, as to the property of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, from our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, than is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, it surpasses it in the point of intelligibility, since it is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a> without any admixture of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, which is not the case with other separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Nor will that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby we shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> be in the genus of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> as regards that whereby He will be seen, but only as regards the act of the one who understands Him, for this act will not be the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> either of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> understanding or of the thing understood.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 10.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> that is separate from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> understands both itself and other things; and in both cases the authority quoted can be verified. For since the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is of itself intelligible and actual, through being separate from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it is clear that when a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> understands itself, that which understands and that which is understood are absolutely identical, for it does not understand itself by an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> abstracted from itself, as we understand material objects. And this is apparently the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii.) as indicated by the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> (De Anima iii). But when it understands other things, the object actually understood becomes one with the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act, in so far as the form of the object understood becomes the form of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, for as much as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is in act; not that it becomes identified with the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> proves (De Natural. vi.), because the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> remains one under two forms whereby it understands two things in succession, in the same way as primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> remains one under various forms. Hence also the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> (De Anima iii.) compares the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in this respect, to primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Thus it by no means follows that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> becomes the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that the latter is compared to it as its perfection or form.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 11.</strong> These and all like authorities must be understood to refer to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the way, for the reason given above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 12.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is unknown if we take it in the privative sense, as such, because it indicates removal of completion whence <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a thing is derived. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> amounts to the same as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> subject to privation, as stated in Phys. iii. But if we take the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in the negative sense, it indicates the absence of limiting <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since even a form is somewhat limited by its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in this sense is of itself most knowable; and it is in this way that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 13.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking of bodily vision, by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will never be seen. This is evident from what precedes: "For no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at any time, nor can any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> see Him as these things which we call visible are seen: in this way He is by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> invisible even as He is incorruptible." As, however, He is by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> supremely being, so He is in Himself supremely intelligible. But that He be for a time not understood by us is owing to our defect: wherefore that He be seen by us after being unseen is owing to a change not in Him but in us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 14.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be seen by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as He is, if this be referred to the mode of the object seen, for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will see that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has the mode which He has. But if we refer the mode to the knower, He will not be seen as He is, because the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will not have so great an efficacy in seeing, as the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> has to the effect of being seen.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 15.</strong> There is a threefold medium both in bodily and in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision. The first is the medium "under which" the object is seen, and this is something perfecting the sight so as to see in general, without determining the sight to any particular object. Such is bodily light in relation to bodily vision; and the light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in relation to the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in so far as this light is a medium. The second is the light "by which" the object is seen, and this is the visible form whereby either sight is determined to a special object, for instance by the form of a stone to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a stone. The third is the medium "in which" it is seen; and this is something by gazing on which the sight is led to something else: thus by looking in a mirror it is led to see the things reflected in the mirror, and by looking at an image it is led to the thing represented by the image. In this way, too, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> an effect is led to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or conversely. Accordingly in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">heavenly vision</a> there will be no third medium, so that, to wit, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the images of other things, as He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> now, for which reason we are said to see now in a glass: nor will there be the second medium, because the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be that whereby our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But there will only be the first medium, which will upraise our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> so that it will be possible for it to be united to the uncreated <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in the aforesaid manner. Yet this medium will not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to be mediate, because it does not come in between the knower and the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but is that which gives the knower the power to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> [Cf. I, 12, 5].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 16.</strong> Corporeal creatures are not said to be seen immediately, except when that which in them is capable of being brought into conjunction with the sight is in conjunction therewith. Now they are not capable of being in conjunction with the sight of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> on account of their materiality: hence they are seen immediately when their image is in conjunction with the sight. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able to be united to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>: wherefore He would not be seen immediately, unless His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> were united to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: and this vision, which is effected immediately, is called <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">"vision of face"</a>. Moreover the likeness of the corporeal object is received into the sight according to the same ratio as it is in the object, although not according to the same mode of being. Wherefore this likeness leads to the object directly: whereas no likeness can lead our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in this way to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as shown above: and for this reason the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether after the resurrection the saints will see God with the eyes of the body? [Cf. I, 12, 3]</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the eyes of the body. Because the glorified eye has greater power than one that is not glorified. Now the <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">blessed Job</a> saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with his eyes (<a href="../bible/job042.htm#verse5">Job 42:5</a>): "With the hearing of the ear, I have heard Thee, but now my eye seeth Thee." Much more therefore will the glorified eye be able to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/job019.htm#verse26">Job 19:26</a>): "In my flesh I shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God my Saviour</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>']." Therefore in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be seen with the eyes of the body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, speaking of the sight of the glorified eyes, expresses himself as follows (De Civ. Dei xxii): "A greater power will be in those eyes, not to see more keenly, as certain serpents or eagles are reported to see (for whatever acuteness of vision is possessed by these animals they can see only corporeal things), but to see even incorporeal things." Now any power that is capable of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> incorporeal things can be upraised to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the glorified eyes will be able to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the disparity of corporeal to incorporeal things is the same as of incorporeal to corporeal. Now the incorporeal eye can see corporeal things. Therefore the corporeal eye can see the incorporeal: and consequently the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/job004.htm#verse16">Job 4:16</a>, "There stood one whose countenance I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not," says (<a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">Moral</a>. v): "Man who, had he been willing to obey the command, would have been <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> in the flesh, became, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, carnal even in mind." Now through becoming carnal in mind, "he thinks only of those things which he draws to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the images of bodies" (Moral. v). Therefore when he will be <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> in the flesh (which is promised to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>), he will be able even in the flesh to see <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. Therefore the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be beatified by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Now he will be beatified not only in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but also in body. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be visible not only to his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> but also to his flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is present to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so will He be to the senses, because He will be "all in all" (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>). Now He will be seen by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> through the union of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> therewith. Therefore He will also be visible to the sense.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse2">Luke 1:2</a>, "There appeared to him an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>," says: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not sought with the eyes of the body, nor surveyed by the sight, nor clasped by the touch." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will by no means be visible to the bodily sense.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse1">Isaiah 6:1</a>, "I saw the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sitting," says: "The Godhead not only of the Father, but also of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is visible, not to carnal eyes, but only to the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, of which it is said: Blessed are the pure in heart."

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says again (as quoted by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Ep. cxlvii): "An incorporeal thing is invisible to a corporeal eye." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely incorporeal. Therefore, etc.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Videndo Deo, Ep. cxlvii): "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as He is at any time, neither in this life, nor in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> life, in the same way as these visible things which are seen with the corporeal sight." Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> life is the life of the blessed, wherein they will live after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p>Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xiv.), "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image inasmuch as he is able to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image as regards his mind, and not as regards his flesh. Therefore he will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with his mind and not with his flesh.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is perceptible to the senses of the body in two ways, directly and indirectly. A thing is perceptible directly if it can act directly on the bodily senses. And a thing can act directly either on sense as such or on a particular sense as such. That which acts directly in this second way on a sense is called a proper sensible, for instance color in relation to the sight, and sound in relation to the hearing. But as sense as such makes use of a bodily organ, nothing can be received therein except corporeally, since whatever is received into a thing is therein after the mode of the recipient. Hence all sensibles act on the sense as such, according to their magnitude: and consequently magnitude and all its consequences, such as movement, rest, number, and the like, are called common sensibles, and yet they are direct objects of sense.

<p>An indirect object of sense is that which does not act on the sense, neither as sense nor as a particular sense, but is annexed to those things that act on sense directly: for instance <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>; the son of Diares; a friend and the like which are the direct object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the universal, and in the particular are the object of the cogitative power in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and of the estimative power in other animals. The external sense is said to perceive things of this kind, although indirectly, when the apprehensive power (whose province it is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> directly this thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>), from that which is sensed directly, apprehends them at once and without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or discourse (thus we see that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is alive from the fact that he speaks): otherwise the sense is not said to perceive it even indirectly.

<p>I say then that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can nowise be seen with the eyes of the body, or perceived by any of the senses, as that which is seen directly, neither here, nor in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: for if that which belongs to sense as such be removed from sense, there will be no sense, and in like manner if that which belongs to sight as sight be removed therefrom, there will be no sight. Accordingly seeing that sense as sense perceives magnitude, and sight as such a sense perceives color, it is impossible for the sight to perceive that which is neither color nor magnitude, unless we call it a sense equivocally. Since then sight and sense will be specifically the same in the glorified body, as in a non-glorified body, it will be impossible for it to see the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> as an object of direct vision; yet it will see it as an object of indirect vision, because on the one hand the bodily sight will see so great a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in bodies, especially in the glorified bodies and most of all in the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and, on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so clearly, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be perceived in things seen with the eye of the body, even as life is perceived in speech. For although our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will not then see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from seeing His creatures, yet it will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His creatures seen corporeally. This manner of seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> corporeally is indicated by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xxii), as is clear if we take note of his words, for he says: "It is very credible that we shall so see the mundane bodies of the new heaven and the new earth, as to see most clearly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> everywhere present, governing all corporeal things, not as we now see the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as understood by those that are made, but as when we see men . . . we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> but see that they live."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of Job refers to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eye, of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse18">Ephesians 1:18</a>): "The eyes of our [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'your'] heart enlightened."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The passage quoted does not mean that we are to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the eyes of the flesh, but that, in the flesh, we shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In these words <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks as one inquiring and conditionally. This appears from what he had said before: "Therefore they will have an altogether different power, if they shall see that incorporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>": and then he goes on to say: "Accordingly a greater power," etc., and afterwards he explains himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> All <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> results from some kind of abstraction from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Wherefore the more a corporeal form is abstracted from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the more is it a principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence it is that a form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in no way a principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, while a form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the senses is somewhat a principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in so far as it is abstracted from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and a form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is still better a principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eye, whence the obstacle to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is removed, can see a corporeal object: but it does not follow that the corporeal eye, in which the cognitive power is deficient as participating in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> perfectly incorporeal objects of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that has become carnal cannot think but of things received from the senses, it thinks of them immaterially. In like manner whatever the sight apprehends it must always apprehend it corporeally: wherefore it cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things which cannot be apprehended corporeally.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Beatitude is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> not through his body but through his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the body is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in so far as it is perfected by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: it follows that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> beatitude does not consist chiefly otherwise than in an act of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and passes from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on to the body by a kind of overflow, as explained above (Question 85, Article 1). Yet our body will have a certain beatitude from seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in sensible creatures: and especially in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can perceive <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, whereas the eyes of the body cannot: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> united to it, but the eyes of the body will not.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the saints, seeing God, see all that God sees? [Cf. I, 12, 7,8]</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, see all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees in Himself. For as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Sum. Bon. 1.): "The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things in the World of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before they happen." Now the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> also in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> see all things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. iv.): "Since all see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there with equal clearness, what do they not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things?" and he refers to the blessed who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore those who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is stated in De Anima (iii, text. 7), that "when an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands the greatest things, it is all the more able to understand the least things." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the greatest of intelligible things. Therefore the power of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is greatly increased by understanding Him. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> seeing Him understands all things.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not hindered from understanding a thing except by this surpassing it. Now no creature surpasses the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> that understands <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. ii.), "to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which sees its <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> all creatures are small." Therefore those who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, every passive power that is not reduced to act is imperfect. Now the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a power that is passive as it were to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things, since "the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is in which all are in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>" (De Anima iii, text. 18). If then in that beatitude it were not to understand all things, it would remain imperfect, which is absurd.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, whoever sees a mirror sees the things reflected in the mirror. Now all things are reflected in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> as in a mirror, because He is the type and image of all. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who see the Word in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> see all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse24">Proverbs 10:24</a>, "to the just their desire shall be given." Now the just desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, since "all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> desire <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>," and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not done away by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will grant them to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is one of the penalties of the present life [Cf. I-II, 85, 3]. Now all penalty will be removed from the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> will be removed: and consequently they will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, the beatitude of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is in their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> before being in their body. Now the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be reformed in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the likeness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a>). Therefore their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will be perfected in likeness to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sees all things in the Word. Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will also see all things in the Word.

<p><strong>Objection 10.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, like the senses, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all the things with the image of which it is informed. Now the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> shows a thing forth more clearly than any other image thereof. Therefore since in that blessed vision the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> becomes the form as it were of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> see all.

<p><strong>Objection 11.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> says (De Anima iii), that "if the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were the form of the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, we should understand all things." Now the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> represents all things more clearly than the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> that sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things.

<p><strong>Objection 12.</strong> Further, the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are enlightened by the higher about the things they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, for the reason that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not all things. Now after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>, one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> will not enlighten another; for then all superiority will cease, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes on <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>, "When He shall have brought to nought," etc. Therefore the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, and for the same reason all the other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Hier. Eccles. vi): "The higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cleanse the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>." Now the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> see the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> while seeing the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> may be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of certain things. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will not see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more perfectly than an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> see all things.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone has the spirit not "by measure" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse34">John 3:34</a>). Now it becomes <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as having the spirit without measure, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things in the Word: wherefore it is stated in the same place (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse35">John 3:35</a>) that "the Father . . . hath given all things into His hand." Therefore none but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is competent to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things in the Word.

<p>Further, the more perfectly a principle is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the more of its effects are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> thereby. Now some of those who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more perfectly than others. Therefore some will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> more things than others, and consequently every one will not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by seeing his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things whatsoever that are, shall be, or have been: and He is said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things by His "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision," because He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them as though they were present in likeness to corporeal vision. Moreover by seeing this <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all that He can do, although He never did them, nor ever will: else He would not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His power perfectly; since a power cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unless its objects be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: and this is called His "science" or "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of simple <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>." Now it is impossible for a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by seeing the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do, because the more perfectly a principle is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the more things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in it; thus in one principle of demonstration one who is quick of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> sees more conclusions than one who is slow of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>. Since then the extent of the Divine power is measured according to what it can do, if an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were to see in the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do, its perfection in understanding would equal in extent the Divine power in producing its effects, and thus it would comprehend the Divine power, which is impossible for any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to do. Yet there is a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, namely the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> [Cf. III, 16, 2], which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> in the Word all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision. But regarding others who see the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> there are two opinions. For some say that all who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> see all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees by His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision. This, however, is contrary to the sayings of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, who hold that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of some things; and yet it is clear that according to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Wherefore others say that others than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although they see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, do not see all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees because they do not comprehend the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all its effects, unless he comprehend the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: and this is not in the competency of a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Consequently of those who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, each one sees in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> so much the more things according as he sees the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> the more clearly: and hence it is that one is able to instruct another concerning these things. Thus the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> can go on increasing until the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>, even as other things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward. But afterwards it will increase no more, because then will be the final state of things, and in that state it is possible that all will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> everything that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The saying of <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a>, that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in the Word all things before they happen," cannot refer to those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of simple <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, because those things will never happen; but it must refer to those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision. Even of these he does not say that all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them all, but that perhaps some do; and that even those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all perfectly. For in one and the same thing there are many intelligible aspects to be considered, such as its various properties and relations to other things: and it is possible that while one thing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in common by two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, one of them perceives more aspects, and that the one learns these aspects from the other. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> learn from the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> the intelligible aspects of things." Wherefore it does not follow that even the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all creatures are able to see all that can be understood in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It follows from this saying of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> that this blessed vision suffices for the seeing of all things on the part of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which is the medium by which one sees, and whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees all things. That all things, however, are not seen is owing to the deficiency of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which does not comprehend the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> sees the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> not according to the mode of that same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but according to its own mode which is finite. Hence its efficacy in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> would need to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> increased by reason of that vision in order for it to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Defective <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> results not only from excess and deficiency of the knowable object in relation to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but also from the fact that the aspect of knowableness is not united to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: thus sometimes the sight sees not a stone, through the image of the stone not being united to it. And although the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> which is the type of all things is united to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of one who sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is united thereto not as the type of all things, but as the type of some and of so much the more according as one sees the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> more fully.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> When a passive power is perceptible by several perfections in order, if it be perfected with its ultimate perfection, it is not said to be imperfect, even though it lack some of the preceding dispositions. Now all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by which the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is perfected is directed to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its end. Wherefore he who sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, even though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing else, would have a perfect <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: nor is his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> more perfect through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> something else besides Him, except in so far as it sees Him more fully. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. v.): "Unhappy is he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> all these" (namely, creatures), "and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not Thee: but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> whoso <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> Thee, though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not these. And whoso <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> both Thee and them is not the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> for them but for Thee only."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> This mirror has a will: and even as He will show Himself to whom He will, so will He show in Himself whatsoever He will. Nor does the comparison with a material mirror hold, for it is not in its power to be seen or not to be seen.

<p>We may also reply that in a material mirror both object and mirror are seen under their proper image; although the mirror be seen through an image received from the thing itself, whereas the stone is seen through its proper image reflected in some other thing, where the reason for seeing the one is the reason for seeing the other. But in the uncreated mirror a thing is seen through the form of the mirror, just as an effect is seen through the image of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and conversely. Consequently it does not follow that whoever sees the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> mirror sees all that is reflected in that mirror: since he who sees the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> does not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> see all its effects, unless he comprehend the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The desire of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things will be fulfilled by the mere fact of their seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: just as their desire to possess all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things will be fulfilled by their possessing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> suffices the affections in that He has perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and by possessing Him we possess all goods as it were, so does the vision of Him suffice the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: "Lord, show us the Father and it is enough for us" (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse8">John 14:8</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> properly so called denotes a privation and thus it is a punishment: for in this way <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is nescience of things, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which is a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> or a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> will not be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of any of these things. Sometimes, however, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is taken in a broad sense of any kind of nescience: and thus the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> will be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of certain things. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will be cleansed from their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>." In this sense <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is not a penalty but a defect. Nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for all such defects to be done away by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: for thus we might say that it was a defect in <a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Pope Linus</a> that he did not attain to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> Our body will be conformed to the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in likeness but not in equality, for it will be endowed with clarity even as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, but not equally. In like manner our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in likeness to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but not in equality thereto: thus it will have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> even as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but not so great, so as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 10.</strong> Although the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the type of all things knowable it will not be united to each <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> according as it is the type of all. Hence the objection proves nothing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 11.</strong> The active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a form proportionate to the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; even as the passive power of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is proportionate to the power of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent, so that whatsoever is in the passive power of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is in the active power of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent. Consequently if the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> become the form of the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the latter must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all those things to which the power of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> extends. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not a form proportionate to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in this sense. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 12.</strong> Nothing hinders us from saying that after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will be consummated once for all, all the blessed will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision, yet so that not all will see all in the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, however, will see clearly all things therein, even as it sees them now; while others will see therein a greater or lesser number of things according to the degree of clearness wherewith they will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will enlighten all other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> concerning those things which it sees in the Word better than others. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse23">Apocalypse 21:23</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall enlighten the city of Jerusalem [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'hath enlightened it'], and the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> is the lamp thereof." In like manner the higher <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will enlighten the lower (not indeed with a new enlightening, so as to increase the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the lower), but with a kind of continued enlightenment; thus we might understand the sun to enlighten the atmosphere while at a standstill. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse3">Daniel 12:3</a>): "They that instruct many to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" shall shine "as stars for all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>." The statement that the superiority of the orders will cease refers to their present ordinate ministry in our regard, as is clear from the same <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>.
