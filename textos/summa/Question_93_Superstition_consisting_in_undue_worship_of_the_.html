<h1>Question 93. Superstition consisting in undue worship of the true God</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3093.htm#article1"> Can there be anything pernicious in the worship of the true God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3093.htm#article2"> Can there be anything superfluous therein?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there can be anything pernicious in the worship of the true God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there cannot be anything pernicious in the worship of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is written (<a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse32">Joel 2:32</a>): "Everyone that shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Now whoever worships <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> calls upon His name. Therefore all worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is conducive to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and consequently none is pernicious.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that is worshiped by the just in any age of the world. Now before the giving of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> the just worshiped <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in whatever manner they pleased, without committing mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> bound himself by his own <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to a special kind of worship, as related in <a href="../bible/gen028.htm">Genesis 28</a>. Therefore now also no worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is pernicious.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing pernicious is tolerated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Yet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> tolerates various rites of divine worship: wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, replying to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the English (Regist. xi, ep. 64), who stated that there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the churches various customs in the celebration of Mass, wrote: "I wish you to choose carefully whatever you find likely to be most pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whether in the Roman territory, or in the land of the Gauls, or in any part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." Therefore no way of worshiping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is pernicious.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [ <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Ep. lxxv, ad Aug.) See Opp. August. Ep. lxxxii] in a letter to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (and the words are quoted in a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse14">Galatians 2:14</a>) says that "after the Gospel <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> had been preached the legal observances became deadly," and yet these observances belonged to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore there can be something deadly in the divine worship.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Cont. Mendac. xiv), "a most pernicious lie is that which is uttered in matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>." Now it is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> if one signify outwardly that which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But just as a thing is signified by word, so it is by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>: and it is in this signification by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> that the outward worship of religion consists, as shown above (Question 81, Article 07). Consequently, if anything <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> is signified by outward worship, this worship will be pernicious.

<p>Now this happens in two ways. On the first place, it happens on the part of the thing signified, through the worship signifying something discordant therefrom: and in this way, at the time of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> being already accomplished, it is pernicious to make use of the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> whereby the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were foreshadowed as things to come: just as it would be pernicious for anyone to declare that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has yet to suffer. On the second place, falsehood in outward worship occurs on the part of the worshiper, and especially in common worship which is offered by ministers impersonating the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For even as he would be guilty of falsehood who would, in the name of another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, proffer things that are not committed to him, so too does a man incur the guilt of falsehood who, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, gives worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> contrary to the manner established by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or divine authority, and according to ecclesiastical custom. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [Comment. in 1 ad Cor. 11:27, quoted in the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>] says: "He is unworthy who celebrates the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> otherwise than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> delivered it." For this reason, too, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse23">Colossians 2:23</a> says that superstition is "the use of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> observances under the name of religion."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to invoke <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to worship Him in spirit and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse23">John 4:23</a>. Hence a worship that contains falsehood, is inconsistent with a salutary calling upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Before the time of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> the just were instructed by an inward instinct as to the way of worshiping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and others followed them. But afterwards men were instructed by outward precepts about this matter, and it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to disobey them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The various customs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the divine worship are in no way contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: wherefore we must observe them, and to disregard them is unlawful.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there can be any excess in the worship of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there cannot be excess in the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is written (<a href="../bible/sir043.htm#verse32">Sirach 43:32</a>): "Glorify the Lord as much as ever you can, for He will yet far exceed." Now the divine worship is directed to the glorification of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore there can be no excess in it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, outward worship is a profession of inward worship, "whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is worshiped with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion iii). Now there can be no excess in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Neither, therefore, can there be in the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> consists in offering to Him what we have received from Him. But we have received all our goods from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore if we do all that we possibly can for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, there will be no excess in the divine worship.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 18) "that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rejects also <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> fancies, from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>." But <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> teaches us to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore there can be superstition by reason of excess even in the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be in excess in two ways. First, with regard to absolute <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, and in this way there cannot be excess in the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because whatever <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does is less than he owes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Secondly, a thing is in excess with regard to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of proportion, through not being proportionate to its end. Now the end of divine worship is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and submit to Him in mind and body. Consequently, whatever a man may do conducing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and subjecting his mind to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and his body, too, by a moderate curbing of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, is not excessive in the divine worship, provided it be in accordance with the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in keeping with the customs of those among whom he lives.

<p>On the other hand if that which is done be, in itself, not conducive to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, nor raise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor curb inordinate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, or again if it be not in accordance with the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or if it be contrary to the general custom--which, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Ad Casulan. Ep. xxxvi], "has the force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>"--all this must be reckoned excessive and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>, because consisting, as it does, of mere externals, it has no connection with the internal worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Vera Relig. iii) quotes the words of <a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse21">Luke 17:21</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is within you," against the "<a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>," those, to wit, who pay more attention to externals.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The glorification of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> implies that what is done is done for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: and this excludes the excess denoted by <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> subject the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that there can be nothing excessive in them. It is different with external acts, which sometimes have no connection with these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers excess by way of absolute <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>.
