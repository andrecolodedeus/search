<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the image of God is in man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse18">Isaiah 40:18</a>): "To whom have you likened <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? or what image will you make for Him?"

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to be the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the property of the First-Begotten, of Whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians 1:15</a>): "Who is the image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the First-Born of every creature." Therefore the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not to be found in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Synod [Super i can. Synod. Ancyr.) that "an image is of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as that which it represents"; and he also says that "an image is the undivided and united likeness of one thing adequately representing another." But there is no <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> common to both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; nor can there be a comparison of equality between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore there can be no image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>): "Let Us make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to Our own image and likeness."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 74): "Where an image <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, there forthwith is likeness; but where there is likeness, there is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> an image." Hence it is clear that likeness is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to an image; and that an image adds something to likeness--namely, that it is copied from something else. For an "image" is so called because it is produced as an imitation of something else; wherefore, for instance, an egg, however much like and equal to another egg, is not called an image of the other egg, because it is not copied from it.

<p>But equality does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of an image; for as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 74): "Where there is an image there is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> equality," as we see in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> image reflected in a glass. Yet this is of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a perfect image; for in a perfect image nothing is wanting that is to be found in that of which it is a copy. Now it is manifest that in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is some likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, copied from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as from an exemplar; yet this likeness is not one of equality, for such an exemplar <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> excels its copy. Therefore there is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not, indeed, a perfect likeness, but imperfect. And <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> implies the same when it says that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made "to" <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness; for the preposition "to" signifies a certain approach, as of something at a distance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Prophet speaks of bodily images made by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore he says pointedly: "What image will you make for Him?" But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> image to Himself in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The First-Born of creatures is the perfect Image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, reflecting perfectly that of which He is the Image, and so He is said to be the "Image," and never "to the image." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be both "image" by reason of the likeness; and "to the image" by reason of the imperfect likeness. And since the perfect likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be except in an identical <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the Image of <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a> in His <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> Son; as the image of the king is in his son, who is of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as himself: whereas it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as in an alien <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as the image of the king is in a silver coin, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says explains in De decem Chordis (Serm. ix, al, xcvi, De Tempore).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As unity means absence of division, a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is said to be the same as far as it is one. Now a thing is said to be one not only numerically, specifically, or generically, but also according to a certain analogy or proportion. In this sense a creature is one with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or like to Him; but when <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says "of a thing which adequately represents another," this is to be understood of a perfect image.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the image of God is to be found in irrational creatures?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be found in irrational creatures. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. ii): "Effects are contingent images of their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> not only of rational, but also of irrational creatures. Therefore the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be found in irrational creatures.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more distinct a likeness is, the nearer it approaches to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an image. But <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the solar ray has a very great similitude to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>." Therefore it is made to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more perfect anything is in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, the more it is like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is more perfect in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for though each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> thing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, all things together are called "very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis 1:31</a>). Therefore the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Consol. iii) says of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "Holding the world in His mind, and forming it into His image." Therefore the whole world is to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not only the rational creature.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. vi, 12): "Man's excellence consists in the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made him to His own image by giving him an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which raises him above the beasts of the field." Therefore things without <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are not made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Not every likeness, not even what is copied from something else, is sufficient to make an image; for if the likeness be only generic, or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> by virtue of some common <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, this does not suffice for one thing to be the image of another. For instance, a worm, though from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> it may originate, cannot be called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> image, merely because of the generic likeness. Nor, if anything is made white like something else, can we say that it is the image of that thing; for whiteness is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> belonging to many <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an image requires likeness in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; thus the image of the king <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in his son: or, at least, in some specific <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, and chiefly in the shape; thus, we speak of a man's image in copper. Whence <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says pointedly that "an image is of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>."

<p>Now it is manifest that specific likeness follows the ultimate difference. But some things are like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> first and most commonly because they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>; secondly, because they live; and thirdly because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or understand; and these last, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 51) "approach so near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in likeness, that among all creatures nothing comes nearer to Him." It is clear, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> creatures alone, properly speaking, are made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Everything imperfect is a participation of what is perfect. Therefore even what falls short of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an image, so far as it possesses any sort of likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, participates in some degree the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an image. So <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says that effects are "contingent images of their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>"; that is, as much as they happen [contingit] to be so, but not absolutely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> compares the solar ray to Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as regards its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>; not as regards its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> dignity which is involved in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an image.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is more perfect in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> creature as regards extension and diffusion; but intensively and collectively the likeness to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is found rather in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> creature, which has a capacity for the highest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Or else we may say that a part is not rightly divided against the whole, but only against another part. Wherefore, when we say that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> alone is to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we do not mean that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> in any part is not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image, but that the other parts are excluded.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> here uses the word "image" to express the likeness which the product of an art bears to the artistic <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the artist. Thus every creature is an image of the exemplar type thereof in the Divine mind. We are not, however, using the word "image" in this sense; but as it implies a likeness in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that is, inasmuch as all things, as being, are like to the First Being; as living, like to the First Life; and as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a>, like to the Supreme Wisdom.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the angels are more to the image of God than man is?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not more to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon de Imagine xliii (de verbis Apost. xxvii) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> granted to no other creature besides <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be to His image. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are more than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (QQ. 83, qu. 51), "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is so much to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not make any creature to be between Him and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and therefore nothing is more akin to Him." But a creature is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image so far as it is akin to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not more to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a creature is said to be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image so far as it is of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not admit of intensity or remissness; for it is not an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> thing, since it is a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not more to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. in Evang. xxxiv): "The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is called a "seal of resemblance" [<a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse12">Ezekiel 28:12</a> because in him the resemblance of the Divine image is wrought with greater expression."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may speak of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image in two ways.

<p>First, we may consider in it that in which the image chiefly consists, that is, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Thus the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more perfect in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> than in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is more perfect, as is clear from what has been said (58, 3; 79, 8).

<p>Secondly, we may consider the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as regards its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, so far as to observe in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a certain imitation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, consisting in the fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and also in the fact that the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in the whole body, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and also in the fact that the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in the whole body, and again, in every part, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in regard to the whole world. In these and the like things the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more perfect in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than it is in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But these do not of themselves belong to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Divine image in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unless we presuppose the first likeness, which is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; otherwise even brute animals would be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image. Therefore, as in their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are more to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is, we must grant that, absolutely speaking, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are more to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is, but that in some respects <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> excludes the inferior creatures bereft of reason from the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but not the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As fire is said to be specifically the most subtle of bodies, while, nevertheless, one kind of fire is more subtle than another; so we say that nothing is more like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in its generic and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> had said previously, "things which have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, are so near to Him in likeness that of all creatures none are nearer." Wherefore this does not mean that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not more to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When we say that <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> does not admit of more or less, we do not mean that one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is not more perfect than another; but that one and the same <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> does not participate in its specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> at one time more than at another; nor do we mean that a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is shared among different <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> in a greater or lesser degree.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the image of God is found in every man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not found in every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the image [Vulg. <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>] of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>). Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it is clear that every <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is not an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>): "Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknew, He also predestined to be made conformable to the image of His Son." But all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are not predestined. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have not the conformity of image.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, likeness belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the image, as above explained (1). But by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes unlike <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore he loses the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa038.htm#verse7">Psalm 38:7</a>): "Surely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> passeth as an image."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by reason of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, he is the most perfectly like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to that in which he can best imitate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> imitates <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> chiefly in this, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands and loves Himself. Wherefore we see that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in three ways.

<p>First, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> possesses a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude for understanding and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this aptitude consists in the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is common to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p>Secondly, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> actually and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though imperfectly; and this image consists in the conformity of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p>Thirdly, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perfectly; and this image consists in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Wherefore on the words, "The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us" (<a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse7">Psalm 4:7</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> distinguishes a threefold image of "creation," of "re-creation," and of "likeness." The first is found in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the second only in the just, the third only in the blessed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in its principal signification, namely the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is found both in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Hence after the words, "To the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> him," it is added, "Male and female He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> them" (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse27">Genesis 1:27</a>). Moreover it is said "them" in the plural, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. iii, 22) remarks, lest it should be thought that both sexes were united in one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. But in a secondary sense the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is found in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and not in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the beginning and end of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the beginning and end of every creature. So when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> had said that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the image and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," he adds his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> for saying this: "For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objections 2 and 3.</strong> These reasons refer to the image consisting in the conformity of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the image of God is in man according to the Trinity of Persons?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of Persons. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Fulgentius De Fide ad Petrum i): "One in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the Godhead of the Holy <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; and one is the image to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made." And <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> (De Trin. v) says: "Man is made to the image of that which is common in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>." Therefore the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is of the Divine Essence, and not of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of Persons.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is said (De Eccl. Dogmat.) that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to be referred to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> also says (De Fide Orth. ii, 12) that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> belongs to him as "an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> being endowed with <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> and self-movement." <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> (De Homin. Opificio xvi) also asserts that, when <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it means that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was made a participator of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for the Godhead is the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>." Now all these things belong more to the unity of the Essence than to the distinction of the Persons. Therefore the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> regards, not the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of Persons, but the unity of the Essence.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an image leads to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that of which it is the image. Therefore, if there is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of Persons; since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> himself by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it follows that by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of the Divine Persons; which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, as was shown above (Question 32, Article 1).

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the name of Image is not applicable to any of the Three Persons, but only to the Son; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 2) that "the Son alone is the image of the Father." Therefore, if in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there were an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as regards the Person, this would not be an image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, but only of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. iv): "The plurality of the Divine Persons is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to have been made to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> as we have seen (40, 2), the distinction of the Divine Persons is only according to origin, or, rather, relations of origin. Now the mode of origin is not the same in all things, but in each thing is adapted to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> thereof; animated things being produced in one way, and inanimate in another; animals in one way, and plants in another. Wherefore it is manifest that the distinction of the Divine Persons is suitable to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>; and therefore to be to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by imitation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> does not exclude being to the same image by the representation of the Divine Persons: but rather one follows from the other. We must, therefore, say that in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both as regards the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> and as regards the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of Persons; for also in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself there is one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> in Three Persons.

<p>Thus it is clear how to solve the first two objections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument would avail if the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> represented <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a perfect manner. But, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 6), there is a great difference between the trinity within ourselves and the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Divine Trinity</a>. Therefore, as he there says: "We see, rather than <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, the trinity which is in ourselves; whereas we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> rather than see that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Some have said that in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is an image of the Son only. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> rejects this opinion (De Trin. xii, 5,6).

<p>First, because as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is like to the Father by a likeness of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it would follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were made in likeness to the Son, that he is made to the likeness of the Father.

<p>Secondly, because if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were made only to the image of the Son, the Father would not have said, "Let Us make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to Our own image and likeness"; but "to Thy image." When, therefore, it is written, "He made him to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," the sense is not that the Father made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the image of the Son only, Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as some explained it, but that the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Divine Trinity</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to Its image, that is, of the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. When it is said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to His image," this can be understood in two ways: first, so that this preposition "to" points to the term of the making, and then the sense is, "Let Us make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in such a way that Our image may be in him."

<p>Secondly, this preposition 'to' may point to the exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as when we say, "This book is made (like) to that one." Thus the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the very Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Which is incorrectly called an image forasmuch as image is put for the exemplar. Or, as some say, the Divine Essence is called an image because thereby one Person imitates another.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the image of God is in man as regards the mind only?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not only in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the image . . . of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not only mind. Therefore the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be observed not only in his mind.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse27">Genesis 1:27</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to His own image; to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> him; male and female He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> them." But the distinction of male and female is in the body. Therefore the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is also in the body, and not only in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an image seems to apply principally to the shape of a thing. But shape belongs to the body. Therefore the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be seen in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body also, and not in his mind.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii, 7,24) there is a threefold vision in us, "corporeal," "<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>," or <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a>, and "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>." Therefore, if in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision that belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in us a trinity by reason of which we are made to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the like reason there must be another trinity in the others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse23">Ephesians 4:23-24</a>): "Be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Whence we are given to understand that our renewal which consists in putting on the new <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Now, he says (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse10">Colossians 3:10</a>): "Putting on the new" <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; "him who is renewed unto <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>" of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "according to the image of Him that <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> him," where the renewal which consists in putting on the new <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ascribed to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore to be to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> only.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> While in all creatures there is some kind of likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the rational creature alone we find a likeness of "image" as we have explained above (1,2); whereas in other creatures we find a likeness by way of a "trace." Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or mind is that whereby the rational creature excels other creatures; wherefore this image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not found even in the rational creature except in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; while in the other parts, which the rational creature may happen to possess, we find the likeness of a "trace," as in other creatures to which, in reference to such parts, the rational creature can be likened. We may easily understand the reason of this if we consider the way in which a "trace," and the way in which an "image," represents anything. An "image" represents something by likeness in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as we have said; while a "trace" represents something by way of an effect, which represents the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in such a way as not to attain to the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For imprints which are left by the movements of animals are called "traces": so also ashes are a trace of fire, and desolation of the land a trace of a hostile army.

<p>Therefore we may observe this difference between rational creatures and others, both as to the representation of the likeness of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> in creatures, and as to the representation in them of the uncreated <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. For as to the likeness of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, rational creatures seem to attain, after a fashion, to the representation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, inasmuch as they imitate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not only in being and life, but also in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, as above explained (2); whereas other creatures do not understand, although we observe in them a certain trace of the Intellect that <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> them, if we consider their disposition. Likewise as the uncreated <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is distinguished by the procession of the Word from the Speaker, and of Love from both of these, as we have seen (28, 3); so we may say that in rational creatures wherein we find a procession of the word in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and a procession of the love in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> an image of the uncreated <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, by a certain representation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. In other creatures, however, we do not find the principle of the word, and the word and love; but we do see in them a certain trace of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of these in the Cause that produced them. For in the fact that a creature has a modified and finite <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, proves that it proceeds from a principle; while its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> points to the (<a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a>) word of the maker, just as the shape of a house points to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the architect; and order points to the maker's love by reason of which he directs the effect to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end; as also the use of the house points to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the architect. So we find in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by way of an "image" in his mind; but in the other parts of his being by way of a "trace."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is called to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not that he is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> an image; but that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is impressed on his mind; as a coin is an image of the king, as having the image of the king. Wherefore there is no need to consider the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in every part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 5), some have thought that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> individually, but severally. They held that "the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> represents the Person of the Father; those born of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> denote the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Son; and that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in likeness to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, since she so proceeded from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as not to be his son or daughter." All of this is manifestly absurd; first, because it would follow that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the principle of the Son, as the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the principle of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> offspring; secondly, because one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would be only the image of one Person; thirdly, because in that case <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> should not have mentioned the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> until after the birth of the offspring. Therefore we must understand that when <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> had said, "to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> him," it added, "male and female He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> them," not to imply that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> came through the distinction of sex, but that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs to both sexes, since it is in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, wherein there is no sexual distinction of sex, but that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs to both sexes, since it is in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, wherein there is no sexual distinction. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse10">Colossians 3:10</a>), after saying, "According to the image of Him that <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> him," added, "Where there is neither male nor female" [these words are in reality from <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse28">Galatians 3:28</a> (Vulg. "neither <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> nor <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>").

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not to be found in his bodily shape, yet because "the body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> alone among terrestrial animals is not inclined prone to the ground, but is adapted to look upward to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, for this reason we may rightly say that it is made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image and likeness, rather than the bodies of other animals," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> remarks (QQ. 83, qu. 51). But this is not to be understood as though the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body; but in the sense that the very shape of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body represents the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by way of a trace.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Both in the corporeal and in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision we may find a trinity, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xi, 2). For in corporeal vision there is first the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the exterior body; secondly, the act of vision, which occurs by the impression on the sight of a certain likeness of the said <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; thirdly, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> applying the sight to see, and to rest on what is seen.

<p>Likewise, in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision we find first the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> kept in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>; secondly, the vision itself, which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the penetrative power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that is, the faculty of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, informed by the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and thirdly, we find the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> joining both together. But each of these trinities falls short of the Divine image. For the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the external body is extrinsic to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, though not extrinsic to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is adventitious to it; and thus in both cases the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> falls short of representing the connaturality and co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the Divine Persons. The corporeal vision, too, does not proceed only from the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the external body, but from this, and at the same time from the sense of the seer; in like manner <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision is not from the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> only which is preserved in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, but also from the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. For these reasons the procession of the Son from the Father alone is not suitably represented. Lastly the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> joining the two together, does not proceed from them either in corporeal or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> vision. Wherefore the procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not thus properly represented.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the image of God is to be found in the acts of the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not found in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xi, 26), that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image, inasmuch as we <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, and love this <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." But to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> does not signify an act. Therefore the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not to be found in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> acts.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. ix, 4) assigns <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to these three things--mind, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and love. But mind does not signify an act, but rather the power or the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not extend to the acts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. x, 11) assigns the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to "<a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, understanding, and will." But these three are "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a> says (1 Sent. D iii). Therefore the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in the powers, and does not extend to the acts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> always remains in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But an act does not always remain. Therefore the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not extend to the acts.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xi, 2 seqq.) assigns the trinity in the lower part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in relation to the actual vision, whether sensible or imaginative. Therefore, also, the trinity in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by reason of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image, must be referred to actual vision.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As above explained (2), a certain representation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an image. Hence, if the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Divine Trinity</a> is to be found in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, we must look for it where the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> approaches the nearest to a representation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the Divine Persons. Now the Divine Persons are distinct from each other by reason of the procession of the Word from the Speaker, and the procession of Love connecting Both. But in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> word "cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without actual thought," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 7). Therefore, first and chiefly, the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is to be found in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that is, inasmuch as from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which we possess, by actual thought we form an internal word; and thence break forth into love. But, since the principles of acts are the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and powers, and everything <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> virtually in its principle, therefore, secondarily and consequently, the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> may be considered as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the powers, and still more in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, forasmuch as the acts virtually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> therein.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Our being bears the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so far as if is proper to us, and excels that of the other animals, that is to say, in so far as we are endowed with a mind. Therefore, this trinity is the same as that which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> mentions (De Trin. ix, 4), and which consists in mind, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observed this trinity, first, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. But because the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, though it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself entirely in a certain degree, yet also in a way does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself--namely, as being distinct from others (and thus also it searches itself, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> subsequently proves--De Trin. x, 3,4); therefore, as though <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> were not in equal proportion to mind, he takes three things in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which are proper to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, understanding, and will; which everyone is conscious of possessing; and assigns the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> pre-eminently to these three, as though the first assignation were in part deficient.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> proves (De Trin. xiv, 7), we may be said to understand, will, and to love certain things, both when we actually consider them, and when we do not thing of them. When they are not under our actual consideration, they are objects of our <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> only, which, in his opinion, is nothing else than <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> retention of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love [Cf. 79, 7, ad 1]. "But since," as he says, "a word cannot be there without actual thought (for we think everything that we say, even if we speak with that interior word belonging to no nation's tongue), this image chiefly consists in these three things, <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, understanding, and will. And by understanding I mean here that whereby we understand with actual thought; and by will, love, or dilection I mean that which unites this child with its parent." From which it is clear that he places the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Divine Trinity</a> more in actual understanding and will, than in these as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> retention of the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>; although even thus the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in a certain degree, as he says in the same place. Thus it is clear that <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, understanding, and will are not three powers as stated in the Sentences.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Someone might answer by referring to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> statement (De Trin. xiv, 6), that "the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> ever remembers itself, ever understands itself, ever loves itself"; which some take to mean that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ever actually understands, and loves itself. But he excludes this interpretation by adding that "it does not always think of itself as actually distinct from other things." Thus it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> always understands and loves itself, not actually but <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>; though we might say that by perceiving its own act, it understands itself whenever it understands anything. But since it is not always actually understanding, as in the case of sleep, we must say that these acts, although not always actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, yet ever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in their principles, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and powers. Wherefore, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 4): "If the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is made to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the sense that it can make use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to understand and consider <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the beginning of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>."

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the image of the Divine Trinity is in the soul only by comparison with God as its object?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Divine Trinity</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> not only by comparison with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its object. For the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Divine Trinity</a> is to be found in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as shown above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>), according as the word in us proceeds from the speaker; and love from both. But this is to be found in us as regards any object. Therefore the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Divine Trinity</a> is in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> as regards any object.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 4) that "when we seek trinity in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, we seek it in the whole of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, without separating the process of reasoning in temporal matters from the consideration of things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>." Therefore the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is to be found in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even as regards temporal objects.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that we can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If, therefore, the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is found in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, understanding, and will or love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this image is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and thus is not common to all.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are most perfectly conformed to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse18">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>): "We . . . are transformed into the same image from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." But temporal things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. Therefore the image of <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a> in us even according to temporal things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 12): "The image of <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, not because it has a remembrance of itself, loves itself, and understands itself; but because it can also remember, understand, and love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by Whom it was made." Much less, therefore, is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in respect of other objects.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As above explained (2,7), image means a likeness which in some degree, however small, attains to a representation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Wherefore we need to seek in the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Divine Trinity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> some kind of representation of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the Divine Persons, so far as this is possible to a creature. Now the Divine Persons, as above stated (6,7), are distinguished from each other according to the procession of the word from the speaker, and the procession of love from both. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself; and Love proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according as He loves Himself. But it is clear that diversity of objects diversifies the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of word and love; for in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a stone is specifically different from that of a horse, which also the love regarding each of them is specifically different. Hence we refer the Divine image in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the verbal concept born of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to the love derived therefrom. Thus the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is found in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> according as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> turns to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or possesses a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that enables it to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> may turn towards an object in two ways: directly and immediately, or indirectly and mediately; as, for instance, when anyone sees a man reflected in a looking-glass he may be said to be turned towards that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. So <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 8), the "the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> remembers itself, understands itself, and loves itself. If we perceive this, we perceive a trinity, not, indeed, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but, nevertheless, rightly called the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But this is due to the fact, not that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> reflects on itself absolutely, but that thereby it can furthermore turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as appears from the authority quoted above (Arg. On the contrary).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> For the notion of an image it is not enough that something proceed from another, but it is also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to observe what proceeds and whence it proceeds; namely, that what is <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> proceeds from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> we may see a kind of trinity, not, however, as though besides the action of temporal things and the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things, "any third thing should be required to make up the trinity," as he adds in the same passage. But in that part of the reason which is concerned with temporal things, "although a trinity may be found; yet the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not to be seen there," as he says farther on; forasmuch as this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of temporal things is adventitious to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Moreover even the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> whereby temporal things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> are not always present; but sometimes they are actually present, and sometimes present only in <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> even after they begin to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Such is clearly the case with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which comes to us temporally for this present life; while in the future life <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will no longer <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, but only the remembrance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be in us only by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Yet there is a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love as seen above (12, 12; 56, 3; 60, 5). This, too, is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in order to understand <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can make use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, in which sense we have already said that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abides ever in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; "whether this image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be so obsolete," as it were clouded, "as almost to amount to nothing," as in those who have not the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; "or obscured and disfigured," as in sinners; or "clear and beautiful," as in the just; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> By the vision of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> temporal things will be seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself; and such a vision of things temporal will belong to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This is what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> means (De Trin. xiv, 6), when he says that "in that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> will blissfully adhere, whatever it sees it will see as unchangeable"; for in the Uncreated Word are the types of all creatures.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether "likeness" is properly distinguished from "image"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that "likeness" is not properly distinguished from "image." For "genus" is not properly distinguished from "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>." Now, "likeness" is to "image" as genus to <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: because, "where there is image, forthwith there is likeness, but not conversely" as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 74). Therefore "likeness" is not properly to be distinguished from "image."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the image consists not only in the representation of the Divine Persons, but also in the representation of the Divine Essence, to which representation belong <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and indivisibility. So it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that the "likeness is in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> because it is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and indivisible; whereas the image is in other things" (Sent. ii, D, xvi).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is threefold--the image of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as above explained (4). But innocence and righteousness belong to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore it is incorrectly said (Sent. ii, D, xvi) "that the image is taken from the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, the understanding and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, while the likeness is from innocence and righteousness."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and love of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; which two things are parts of the image. Therefore it is incorrect to say (Sent. ii, D, xvi) that "the image consists in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the likeness in the love of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 51): "Some consider that these two were mentioned not without reason, namely "image" and "likeness," since, if they meant the same, one would have sufficed."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Likeness is a kind of unity, for oneness in <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> likeness, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, Did. iv, 15). Now, since "one" is a transcendental, it is both common to all, and adapted to each single thing, just as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Wherefore, as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> can be compared to each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> thing both as its preamble, and as subsequent to it, as signifying some perfection in it, so also in the same way there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> a kind of comparison between "likeness" and "image." For the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is a preamble to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and, again, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is subsequent to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inasmuch as we may say of a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that he is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by reason of his perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. In like manner, likeness may be considered in the light of a preamble to image, inasmuch as it is something more general than image, as we have said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>): and, again, it may be considered as subsequent to image, inasmuch as it signifies a certain perfection of image. For we say that an image is like or unlike what it represents, according as the representation is perfect or imperfect. Thus likeness may be distinguished from image in two ways: first as its preamble and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in more things, and in this sense likeness regards things which are more common than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> properties, wherein the image is properly to be seen. In this sense it is stated (QQ. 83, qu. 51) that "the spirit" (namely, the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>) without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> was made to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. "But the other parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> inferior faculties, or even to the body, "are in the opinion of some made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness." In this sense he says (De Quant. Animae ii) that the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is found in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> incorruptibility; for corruptible and incorruptible are differences of universal beings. But likeness may be considered in another way, as signifying the expression and perfection of the image. In this sense <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 12) that the image implies "an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> being, endowed with <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> and self-movement, whereas likeness implies a likeness of power, as far as this may be possible in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." In the same sense "likeness" is said to belong to "the love of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>": for there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without love of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "Likeness" is not distinct from "image" in the general notion of "likeness" (for thus it is included in "image"); but so far as any "likeness" falls short of "image," or again, as it perfects the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of "image."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> belongs to the "image," as representing the Divine Essence in those things which belong to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but not in those <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> subsequent to general notions of being, such as simplicity and indissolubility.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, at least, in their seeds, by reason of which we may say that a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> "likeness" <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Nor it is unfitting to us the term "image" from one point of view and from another the term "likeness."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Love of the word, which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> loved, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of "image"; but love of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> belongs to "likeness," as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself belongs to likeness.
