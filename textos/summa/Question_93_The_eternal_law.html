<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the eternal law is a sovereign type [Ratio] existing in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not a sovereign type <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For there is only one <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But there are many types of things in the Divine mind; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 46) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "made each thing according to its type." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not seem to be a type <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the Divine mind.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that it be promulgated by word, as stated above (Question 90, Article 4). But Word is a Personal name in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated in the I, 34, 1: whereas type refers to the Essence. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not the same as a Divine type.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xxx): "We see a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> above our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>, which is called <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which is above our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not the same as the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a type. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not the same as the sovereign type.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 6) that "the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is the sovereign type, to which we must always conform."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as in every artificer there pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> a type of the things that are made by his art, so too in every governor there must pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> the type of the order of those things that are to be done by those who are subject to his government. And just as the type of the things yet to be made by an art is called the art or exemplar of the products of that art, so too the type in him who governs the acts of his subjects, bears the character of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, provided the other <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> be present which we have mentioned above (<a href="#90">Article 90</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by His wisdom, is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> of all things in relation to which He stands as the artificer to the products of his art, as stated in the I, 14, 8. Moreover He governs all the acts and movements that are to be found in each single creature, as was also stated in the I, 103, 5. Wherefore as the type of the Divine Wisdom, inasmuch as by It all things are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, has the character of art, exemplar or <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; so the type of Divine Wisdom, as moving all things to their due end, bears the character of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is nothing else than the type of Divine Wisdom, as directing all actions and movements.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking in that passage of the ideal types which regard the proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of each single thing; and consequently in them there is a certain distinction and plurality, according to their different relations to things, as stated in the I, 15, 2. But <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is said to direct <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> by ordaining them to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (Question 90, Article 2). And things, which are in themselves different, may be considered as one, according as they are ordained to one common thing. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is one since it is the type of this order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> With regard to any sort of word, two points may be considered: viz. the word itself, and that which is expressed by the word. For the spoken word is something uttered by the mouth of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and expresses that which is signified by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> word. The same applies to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> word, which is nothing else that something conceived by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> expresses his thoughts <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a>. So then in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Word conceived by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the Father is the name of a Person: but all things that are in the Father's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whether they refer to the Essence or to the Persons, or to the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are expressed by this Word, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Trin. xv, 14). And among other things expressed by this Word, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> itself is expressed thereby. Nor does it follow that the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is a Personal name in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: yet it is appropriated to the Son, on account of the kinship between type and word.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The types of the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> do not stand in the same relation to things, as the types of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is measured by things, so that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> concept is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> by reason of itself, but by reason of its being consonant with things, since "an opinion is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> according as it answers to the reality." But the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the measure of things: since each thing has so far <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in it, as it represents the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as was stated in the I, 16, 1. Consequently the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in itself; and its type is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the eternal law is known to all?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all. Because, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>), "the things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is a type <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the Divine mind. Therefore it is unknown to all save <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 6) "the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is that by which it is right that all things should be most orderly." But all do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how all things are most orderly. Therefore all do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xxxi) that "the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not subject to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." But according to Ethic. i, "any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can judge well of what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 6) that "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is imprinted on us."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in two ways: first, in itself; secondly, in its effect, wherein some likeness of that thing is found: thus someone not seeing the sun in its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it by its rays. So then no one can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as it is in itself, except the blessed who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His Essence. But every rational creature <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it in its reflection, greater or less. For every <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is a kind of reflection and participation of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which is the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xxxi). Now all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to a certain extent, at least as to the common principles of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>: and as to the others, they partake of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, some more, some less; and in this respect are more or less cognizant of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as they are in themselves; but they are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us in their effects, according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>: "The invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although each one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> according to his own capacity, in the way explained above, yet none can comprehend it: for it cannot be made perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its effects. Therefore it does not follow that anyone who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in the way aforesaid, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also the whole order of things, whereby they are most orderly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To judge a thing may be understood in two ways. First, as when a cognitive power judges of its proper object, according to <a href="../bible/job012.htm#verse11">Job 12:11</a>: "Doth not the ear discern words, and the palate of him that eateth, the taste?" It is to this kind of judgment that the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> alludes when he says that "anyone can judge well of what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>," by judging, namely, whether what is put forward is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. In another way we speak of a superior judging of a subordinate by a kind of practical judgment, as to whether he should be such and such or not. And thus none can judge of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether every law is derived from the eternal law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For there is a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the "fomes," as stated above (Question 91, Article 6), which is not derived from that <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, since thereunto pertains the "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh," of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse7">Romans 8:7</a>), that "it cannot be subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore not every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> can be derived from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, because, as stated above (2, Objection 2), "the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is that, according to which it is right that all things should be most orderly." But some laws are <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa010.htm#verse1">Isaiah 10:1</a>: "Woe to them that make <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> laws." Therefore not every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5) that "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which is framed for ruling the people, rightly permits many things which are punished by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>." But the type of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore not even every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Divine Wisdom says (<a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse15">Proverbs 8:15</a>): "By Me kings reign, and lawgivers decree just things." But the type of Divine Wisdom is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore all laws proceed from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (90, A1,2), the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> denotes a kind of plan directing acts towards an end. Now wherever there are movers ordained to one another, the power of the second mover must needs be derived from the power of the first mover; since the second mover does not move except in so far as it is moved by the first. Wherefore we observe the same in all those who govern, so that the plan of government is derived by secondary governors from the governor in chief; thus the plan of what is to be done in a state flows from the king's command to his inferior administrators: and again in things of art the plan of whatever is to be done by art flows from the chief craftsman to the under-crafts-men, who work with their hands. Since then the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is the plan of government in the Chief Governor, all the plans of government in the inferior governors must be derived from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But these plans of inferior governors are all other laws besides the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore all laws, in so far as they partake of right reason, are derived from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 6) that "in temporal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> there is nothing just and lawful, but what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has drawn from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The "fomes" has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in so far as it is a punishment resulting from Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and in this respect it is evident that it is derived from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But in so far as it denotes a proneness to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, and has not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (Question 91, Article 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Human <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in so far as it partakes of right reason; and it is clear that, in this respect, it is derived from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But in so far as it deviates from reason, it is called an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> but of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Nevertheless even an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in so far as it retains some appearance of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, though being framed by one who is in power, is derived from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; since all power is from the Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is said to permit certain things, not as approving them, but as being unable to direct them. And many things are directed by the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is unable to direct, because more things are subject to a higher than to a lower <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence the very fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not meddle with matters it cannot direct, comes under the ordination of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. It would be different, were <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to sanction what the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> condemns. Consequently it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not derived from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but that it is not on a perfect equality with it.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether necessary and eternal things are subject to the eternal law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things are subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For whatever is reasonable is subject to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is reasonable, for it is just. Therefore it is subject to (the Divine) reason. But the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is the Divine reason. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things are subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is subject to the King, is subject to the King's <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now the Son, according to <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 15:28-29</a>, "shall be subject . . . to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Father . . . when He shall have delivered up the Kingdom to Him." Therefore the Son, Who is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, is subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> as a type. But many <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things are subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>: for instance, the stability of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">incorporeal substances</a> and of the heavenly bodies. Therefore even <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things are subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> cannot be otherwise, and consequently need no restraining. But laws are imposed on men, in order to restrain them from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as explained above (Question 92, Article 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is the type of the Divine government. Consequently whatever is subject to the Divine government, is subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: while if anything is not subject to the Divine government, neither is it subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. The application of this distinction may be gathered by looking around us. For those things are subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> government, which can be done by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; but what pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> government; for instance, that he should have a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, hands, or feet. Accordingly all that is in things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whether it be contingent or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, is subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: while things pertaining to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> or Essence are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but are the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We may speak of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will in two ways. First, as to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> itself: and thus, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is His very Essence, it is subject neither to the Divine government, nor to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but is the same thing as the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Secondly, we may speak of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, as to the things themselves that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills about creatures; which things are subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in so far as they are planned by Divine Wisdom. In reference to these things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is said to be reasonable [rationalis]: though regarded in itself it should rather be called their type [ratio].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Son was not made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but was <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently He is not subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> or to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: but rather is Himself the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> by a kind of appropriation, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> explains (De Vera Relig. xxxi). But He is said to be subject to the Father by reason of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in respect of which also the Father is said to be greater than He.

<p>The third objection we grant, because it deals with those <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things that are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, text. 6), some <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things have a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>: and thus they derive from something else the fact that they cannot be otherwise. And this is in itself a most effective restraint; for whatever is restrained, is said to be restrained in so far as it cannot do otherwise than it is allowed to.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether natural contingents are subject to the eternal law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> contingents are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Because promulgation is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (Question 90, Article 4). But a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> cannot be promulgated except to rational creatures, to whom it is possible to make an announcement. Therefore none but rational creatures are subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; and consequently <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> contingents are not.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Whatever obeys reason partakes somewhat of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>," as stated in Ethic. i. But the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, is the supreme type, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Since then <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> contingents do not partake of reason in any way, but are altogether void of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it seems that they are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is most efficient. But in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> contingents defects occur. Therefore they are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse29">Proverbs 8:29</a>): "When He compassed the sea with its bounds, and set a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to the waters, that they should not pass their limits."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must speak otherwise of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, than of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> extends only to rational creatures subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The reason of this is because <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> directs the actions of those that are subject to the government of someone: wherefore, properly speaking, none imposes a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> on his own actions. Now whatever is done regarding the use of irrational things subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is done by the act of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself moving those things, for these irrational creatures do not move themselves, but are moved by others, as stated above (Question 1, Article 2). Consequently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot impose laws on irrational beings, however much they may be subject to him. But he can impose laws on rational beings subject to him, in so far as by his command or pronouncement of any kind, he imprints on their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> a rule which is a principle of action.

<p>Now just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by such pronouncement, impresses a kind of inward principle of action on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is subject to him, so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> imprints on the whole of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the principles of its proper actions. And so, in this way, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to command the whole of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa148.htm#verse6">Psalm 148:6</a>: "He hath made a decree, and it shall not pass away." And thus all actions and movements of the whole of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Consequently irrational creatures are subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, through being moved by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>; but not, as rational creatures are, through understanding the Divine commandment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The impression of an inward active principle is to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, what the promulgation of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: because <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, by being promulgated, imprints on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a directive principle of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Irrational creatures neither partake of nor are obedient to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: whereas they do partake of the Divine <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> by obeying it; because the power of Divine <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> extends over more things than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> does. And as the members of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body are moved at the command of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and yet do not partake of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, since they have no apprehension subordinate to reason; so too irrational creatures are moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without, on that account, being rational.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the defects which occur in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are outside the order of particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, they are not outside the order of universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, especially of the First Cause, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whose <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> nothing can escape, as stated in the I, 22, 2. And since the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is the type of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), hence the defects of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether all human affairs are subject to the eternal law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs are subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse18">Galatians 5:18</a>): "If you are led by the spirit you are not under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." But the righteous who are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by adoption, are led by the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse14">Romans 8:14</a>: "Whosoever are led by the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore not all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are under the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse7">Romans 8:7</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'wisdom'] of the flesh is an enemy to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for it is not subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But many are those in whom the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh dominates. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 6) that "the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is that by which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> deserve misery, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, a life of blessedness." But those who are already blessed, and those who are already lost, are not in the state of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Therefore they are not under the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 12): "Nothing evades the laws of the most high Creator and Governor, for by Him the peace of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is administered."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two ways in which a thing is subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as explained above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>): first, by partaking of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; secondly, by way of action and passion, i.e. by partaking of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> by way of an inward motive principle: and in this second way, irrational creatures are subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). But since the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, together with that which it has in common with all creatures, has something proper to itself inasmuch as it is rational, consequently it is subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in both ways; because while each rational creature has some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), it also has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to that which is in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; for "we are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> adapted to the recipients of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" (Ethic. ii, 1).

<p>Both ways, however, are imperfect, and to a certain extent destroyed, in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; because in them the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is corrupted by <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, and, moreover, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is darkened by <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> both ways are found more perfect: because in them, besides the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, there is the added <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and wisdom; and again, besides the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, there is the added motive of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Accordingly, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are perfectly subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as always acting according to it: whereas the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are subject to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, imperfectly as to their actions, indeed, since both their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and their inclination thereto, are imperfect; but this imperfection on the part of action is supplied on the part of passion, in so far as they suffer what the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> decrees concerning them, according as they fail to act in harmony with that <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 15): "I esteem that the righteous act according to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; and (De Catech. Rud. xviii): Out of the just misery of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which deserted Him, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to furnish the inferior parts of His creation with most suitable laws."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> may be understood in two ways. First, so that a man is said to be under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, through being pinned down thereby, against his will, as by a load. Hence, on the same passage a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that "he is under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, who refrains from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, through fear of punishment threatened by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and not from love of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." In this way the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, because he fulfils the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> willingly, through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is poured into his heart by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Secondly, it can be understood as meaning that the works of a man, who is led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, are the works of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> rather than his own. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as neither is the Son, as stated above (4, ad 2); it follows that such works, in so far as they are of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, are not under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> to this when he says (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse17">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>): "Where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is, there is liberty."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh cannot be subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as regards action; since it inclines to actions contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>: yet it is subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as regards passion; since it deserves to suffer punishment according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Nevertheless in no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh dominate so far as to destroy the whole <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and consequently there remains in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the inclination to act in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For we have seen above (Question 85, Article 2) that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not destroy entirely the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A thing is maintained in the end and moved towards the end by one and the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: thus gravity which makes a heavy body rest in the lower place is also the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its being moved thither. We therefore reply that as it is according to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that some deserve <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, others unhappiness, so is it by the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that some are maintained in a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> state, others in an unhappy state. Accordingly both the blessed and the damned are under the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.
