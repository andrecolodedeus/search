<h1>Question 93. The happiness of the saints and their mansions</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5093.htm#article1"> Will the happiness of the saints increase after the judgment?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5093.htm#article2"> Should the degrees of happiness be called mansions?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5093.htm#article3"> Do the various mansions differ according to various degrees of charity?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the happiness of the saints will be greater after the judgment than before?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will not be greater after the judgment than before. For the nearer a thing approaches to the Divine likeness, the more perfectly does it participate <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when separated from the body than when united to it. Therefore its <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is greater before being reunited to the body than after.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, power is more effective when it is united than when divided. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more united when separated from the body than when it is joined to the body. Therefore it has then greater power for operation, and consequently has a more perfect share of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, since this consists in action [Cf. I-II, 3, 2].

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, beatitude consists in an act of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in its act, makes no use of a bodily organ; and consequently by being reunited to the body the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not become capable of more perfect understanding. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not greater after than before the judgment.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, nothing can be greater than the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and so the addition of the finite to the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> does not result in something greater than the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> by itself. Now the beatified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> before its reunion with the body is rendered <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> by rejoicing in the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a> it will rejoice in nothing else except perhaps the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body, and this is a finite <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> after the resumption of the body will not be greater than before.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rev006.htm#verse9">Apocalypse 6:9</a>, "I saw under the altar the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of them that were slain," says: "At present the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are under the altar, i.e. less exalted than they will be." Therefore their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> will be greater after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> than after their death.

<p>Further, just as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as a reward, so is unhappiness awarded to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. But the unhappiness of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> after reunion with their bodies will be greater than before, since they will be punished not only in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but also in the body. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be greater after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a> than before.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will increase in extent after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, because their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> will then be not only in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but also in the body. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> also will increase in extent, seeing that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will rejoice not only in its own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but also in that of the body. We may also say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> will increase in intensity [Cf. I-II, 4, 5, ad 5, where <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> retracts this statement]. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body may be considered in two ways: first, as being dependent on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for its completion; secondly, as containing something that hampers the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in its operations, through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> not perfectly completing the body. As regards the first way of considering the body, its union with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> adds a certain perfection to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since every part is imperfect, and is completed in its whole; wherefore the whole is to the part as form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more perfect in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being, when it is in the whole--namely, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who results from the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body--than when it is a separate part. But as regards the second consideration the union of the body hampers the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom 9:15</a>) that "the corruptible body is a load upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." If, then, there be removed from the body all those things wherein it hampers the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> action, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be simply more perfect while <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in such a body than when separated therefrom. Now the more perfect a thing is in being, the more perfectly is it able to operate: wherefore the operation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united to such a body will be more perfect than the operation of the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the glorified body will be a body of this description, being altogether subject to the spirit. Therefore, since beatitude consists in an operation [Cf. I-II, 3, 2, seqq.], the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> after its reunion with the body will be more perfect than before. For just as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from a corruptible body is able to operate more perfectly than when united thereto, so after it has been united to a glorified body, its operation will be more perfect than while it was separated. Now every imperfect thing desires its perfection. Hence the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires reunion with the body and on account of this desire which proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> imperfection its operation whereby it is borne towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is less intense. This agrees with the saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35) that "on account of the body's desire it is held back from tending with all its might to that sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united to a glorified body is more like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than when separated therefrom, in so far as when united it has more perfect being. For the more perfect a thing is the more it is like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: even so the heart, the perfection of whose life consists in movement, is more like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> while in movement than while at rest, although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is never moved.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A power which by its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is capable of being in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is more effective when subjected in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> than when separated from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, although absolutely speaking a power separate from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is more effective.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although in the act of understanding the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not make use of the body, the perfection of the body will somewhat conduce to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation in so far as through being united to a glorified body, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be more perfect in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and consequently more effective in its operation, and accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> itself of the body will conduce instrumentally, as it were, to the operation wherein <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists: thus the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> asserts (Ethic. i, 8,10) that external goods conduce instrumentally to the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although finite added to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> does not make a greater thing, it makes more things, since finite and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> are two things, while <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> taken by itself is one. Now the greater extent of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> regards not a greater thing but more things. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is increased in extent, through referring to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to the body's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Moreover, the body's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> will conduce to the intensity of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> that refers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in so far as it will conduce to the more perfect operation whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> tends to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: since the more perfect is a becoming operation, the greater the delight [Cf. I-II, 32, 1], as stated in Ethic. x, 8.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the degrees of beatitude should be called mansions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the degrees of beatitude should not be called mansions. For beatitude implies the notion of a reward: whereas mansion denotes nothing pertaining to a reward. Therefore the various degrees of beatitude should not be called mansions.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, mansion seemingly denotes a place. Now the place where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> will be beatified is not corporeal but <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is one. Therefore there is but one mansion: and consequently the various degrees of beatitude should not be called mansions.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> there will be men of various <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, so are there now in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, and were in the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the fathers. But various mansions are not distinguished in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> and <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>. Therefore in like manner neither should they be distinguished in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse2">John 14:2</a>): "In My Father's house there are many mansions": and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounds this in reference to the different degrees of rewards (Tract. lxvii in Joan.).

<p>Further, in every well-ordered city there is a distinction of mansions. Now the heavenly kingdom is compared to a city (<a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse2">Apocalypse 21:2</a>). Therefore we should distinguish various mansions there according to the various degrees of beatitude.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since local movement precedes all other movements, terms of movement, distance and the like are derived from local movement to all other movements according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys., liber viii, 7). Now the end of local movement is a place, and when a thing has arrived at that place it remains there at rest and is maintained therein. Hence in every movement this very rest at the end of the movement is called an establishment [collocatio] or mansion. Wherefore since the term movement is transferred to the actions of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> and will, the attainment of the end of an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement is called a mansion or establishment: so that the unity of a house corresponds to the unity of beatitude which unity is on the part of the object, and the plurality of mansions corresponds to the differences of beatitude on the part of the blessed: even so we observe in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things that there is one same place above to which all light objects tend, whereas each one reaches it more closely, according as it is lighter, so that they have various mansions corresponding to their various lightness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Mansion implies the notion of end and consequently of reward which is the end of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Though there is one <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> place, there are different degrees of approaching thereto: and the various mansions correspond to these.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who were in <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> or are now in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> have not yet attained to their end. Wherefore various mansions are not distinguished in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> or <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>, but only in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, wherein is the end of the good and of the wicked.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the various mansions are distinguished according to the various degrees of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the various mansions are not distinguished according to the various degrees of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse15">Matthew 25:15</a>): "He gave to every one according to his proper <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'ability']." Now the proper ability of a thing is its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> also of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are distributed according to the different degrees of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse12">Psalm 61:12</a>): "Thou wilt render to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to his works." Now that which is rendered is the measure of beatitude. Therefore the degrees of beatitude are distinguished according to the diversity of works and not according to the diversity of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, reward is due to act and not to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: hence "it is not the strongest who are crowned but those who engage in the conflict" (Ethic. i, 8) and "he . . . shall not be [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'is not'] crowned except he strive lawfully." Now beatitude is a reward. Therefore the various degrees of beatitude will be according to the various degrees of works and not according to the various degrees of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The more one will be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> will one be. Now the measure of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the measure of one's union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the diversity of beatitude will be according to the difference of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>Further, "if one thing simply follows from another thing simply, the increase of the former follows from the increase of the latter." Now to have beatitude follows from having <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore to have greater beatitude follows from having greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The distinctive principle of the mansions or degrees of beatitude is twofold, namely proximate and remote. The proximate principle is the difference of disposition which will be in the blessed, whence will result the difference of perfection in them in respect to the beatific operation: while the remote principle is the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by which they have obtained that beatitude. In the first way the mansions are distinguished according to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, which the more perfect it will be in any one, the more will it render him capable of the Divine clarity, on the increase of which will depend the increase in perfection of the Divine vision. In the second way the mansions are distinguished according to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the way. For our actions are <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, not by the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the action, but only by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with which they are informed. Now every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> obtains its <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> efficacy from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> [Cf. I-II, 114, 4], which has the end itself for its object [Cf. II-II, 24, 3, ad 1]. Hence the diversity of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is all traced to the diversity of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and thus the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the way will distinguish the mansions by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In this passage "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" denotes not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> ability alone, but the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> ability together with the endeavour to obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> [Cf. II-II, 23, 8]. Consequently <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in this sense will be a kind of material disposition to the measure of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that one will receive. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the formal complement of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in relation to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and therefore the distinction of degrees in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> depends on the degrees of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than on the degrees of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Works in themselves do not demand the payment of a reward, except as informed by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: and therefore the various degrees of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> will be according to the various degrees of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> or of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whatever is not a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to which a reward is due, it is none the less the principle and reason of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in the act: and consequently according to its diversity is the diversity of rewards. This does not prevent our observing a certain degree of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in the act considered generically, not indeed in relation to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward which is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in relation to some <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward, which is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in some <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.
