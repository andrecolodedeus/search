<h1>Question 94. Idolatry</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3094.htm#article1"> Is idolatry a species of superstition?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3094.htm#article2"> Is it a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3094.htm#article3"> Is it the gravest sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3094.htm#article4"> The cause of this sin</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether idolatry is rightly reckoned a species of superstition?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is not rightly reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of superstition. Just as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are unbelievers, so are idolaters. But <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief, as stated above (Question 11, Article 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is also a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief and not of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, latria pertains to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of religion to which superstition is opposed. But latria, apparently, is univocally applied to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and to that which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. For just as we speak univocally of the desire of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and of the desire of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, so too, seemingly, we speak univocally of the worship of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods, which is called <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and of the worship of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the latria of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is nothing cannot be the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of any genus. But <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, apparently, is nothing: for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>): "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> is nothing in the world," and further on (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse19">1 Corinthians 10:19</a>): "What then? Do I say that what is offered in sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> is anything? Or that the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> is anything?" implying an answer in the negative. Now offering things to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Therefore since <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is like to nothing, it cannot be a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it belongs to superstition to give divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to whom that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not due. Now divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is undue to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, just as it is undue to other creatures, wherefore certain people are reproached (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse25">Romans 1:25</a>) for that they "worshipped and served the creature rather than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>." Therefore this <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of superstition is unfittingly called <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and should rather be named "worship of creatures."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is related (<a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse16">Acts 17:16</a>) that when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> awaited Silas and Timothy at Athens, "his spirit was stirred within him seeing the whole city given to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>," and further on (<a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse22">Acts 17:22</a>) he says: "Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 92, Article 2), it belongs to superstition to exceed the due mode of divine worship, and this is done chiefly when divine worship is given to whom it should not be given. Now it should be given to the most high uncreated <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, as stated above (Question 81, Article 1) when we were treating of religion. Therefore it is superstition to give worship to any creature whatsoever.

<p>Now just as this divine worship was given to sensible creatures by means of sensible signs, such as <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, games, and the like, so too was it given to a creature represented by some sensible form or shape, which is called an "<a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a>." Yet divine worship was given to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> in various ways. For some, by means of a nefarious art, constructed images which produced certain effects by the power of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>: wherefore they deemed that the images themselves contained something <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>-like, and consequently that divine worship was due to them. This was the opinion of Hermes Trismegistus [De Natura Deorum, ad Asclep], as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Civ. Dei viii, 23): while others gave divine worship not to the images, but to the creatures represented thereby. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> alludes to both of these (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse23">Romans 1:23-25</a>). For, as regards the former, he says: "They changed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the incorruptible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> into the likeness of the image of a corruptible <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and of birds, and of four-footed beasts, and of creeping things," and of the latter he says: "Who worshipped and served the creature rather than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>."

<p>These latter were of three ways of thinking. For some deemed certain men to have been gods, whom they worshipped in the images of those men: for instance, Jupiter, Mercury, and so forth. Others again deemed the whole world to be one god, not by reason of its material <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but by reason of its <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for they held <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be nothing else than a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> governing the world by movement and reason: even as a man is said to be wise in respect not of his body but of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence they thought that divine worship ought to be given to the whole world and to all its parts, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, air, water, and to all such things: and to these they referred the names of their gods, as Varro asserted, and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> relates (De Civ. Dei vii, 5). Lastly, others, namely, the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, said that there is one supreme god, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things. After him they placed certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by the supreme god. These they called "gods," on account of their having a share of the godhead; but we call them "<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." After these they placed the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the heavenly bodies, and beneath these the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> which they stated to be certain animal denizens of the air, and beneath these again they placed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be taken up into the fellowship of the gods or of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. To all these they gave divine worship, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> relates (De Civ . . Dei xviii, 14).

<p>The last two opinions were held to belong to "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>" which the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> gathered from their study of the world and taught in the schools: while the other, relating to the worship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, was said to belong to "mythical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>" which was wont to be represented on the stage according to the fancies of poets. The remaining opinion relating to images was held to belong to "civil <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>," which was celebrated by the pontiffs in the temples [De Civ. Dei vi, 5.

<p>Now all these come under the head of the superstition of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 20): "Anything invented by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for making and worshipping <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, or for giving Divine worship to a creature or any part of a creature, is <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as religion is not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but a confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by outward signs, so superstition is a confession of unbelief by external worship. Such a confession is signified by the term <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, but not by the term <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which only means a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief, but <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The term latria may be taken in two senses. On one sense it may denote a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> pertaining to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and then its signification remains the same, to whomsoever it be shown, because, in this sense, the thing to which it is shown is not included in its definition. Taken thus latria is applied univocally, whether to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion or to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, just as the payment of a tax is univocally the same, whether it is paid to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or to a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> king. On another sense latria denotes the same as religion, and then, since it is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> thereto that divine worship be given to whom it ought to be given; and in this way latria is applied equivocally to the latria of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, and to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>: just as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is applied equivocally to the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> that is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and to that which is carnal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> that "an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> is nothing in the world" means that those images which were called <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, were not animated, or possessed of a divine power, as Hermes maintained, as though they were composed of spirit and body. On the same sense we must understand the saying that "what is offered in sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> is not anything," because by being thus sacrificed the sacrificial flesh acquired neither sanctification, as the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> thought, nor <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> held.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It was owing to the general custom among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> of worshipping any kind of creature under the form of images that the term "<a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>" was used to signify any worship of a creature, even without the use of images.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether idolatry is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nothing is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> employs in worshipping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> employs images for the divine worship: since both in the Tabernacle were there images of the cherubim, as related in <a href="../bible/exo025.htm">Exodus 25</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are images set up which the faithful worship. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> are worshipped, is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, reverence should be paid to every superior. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed are our superiors. Therefore it will be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to pay them reverence by worship, of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> or the like.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with an inward worship, according to <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John 4:24</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . they must <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> . . . in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>": and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion iii), that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is worshipped by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Now a man may happen to worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> outwardly, and yet not wander from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> inwardly. Therefore it seems that we may worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> outwardly without prejudice to the divine worship.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse5">Exodus 20:5</a>): "Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> them," i.e. outwardly, "nor serve them," i.e. inwardly, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains it: and it is a question of graven things and images. Therefore it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> whether outwardly or inwardly.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There has been a twofold <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in this matter. For some [The School of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>] have thought that to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and other things pertaining to latria, not only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but also to the others aforesaid, is due and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, since they held that divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> should be paid to every superior <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as being nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But this is unreasonable. For though we ought to revere all superiors, yet the same reverence is not due to them all: and something special is due to the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who excels all in a singular manner: and this is the worship of <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>.

<p>Nor can it be said, as some have maintained, that "these visible <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are fitting with regard to other gods, and that to the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as being better than those others, better <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, namely, the service of a pure mind, should be offered" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, as quoted below]. The reason is that, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x, 19), "external <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are signs of internal, just as audible words are signs of things. Wherefore, just as by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and praise we utter significant words to Him, and offer to Him in our hearts the things they signify, so too in our <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> we ought to realize that we should offer a visible sacrifice to no other than to Him Whose invisible sacrifice we ourselves should be in our hearts."

<p>Others held that the outward worship of latria should be given to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, not as though it were something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or fitting in itself, but as being in harmony with the general custom. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei vi, 10) quotes Seneca as saying: "We shall <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a>," says he, "in such a way as to remember that our worship is in accordance with custom rather than with the reality": and (De Vera Relig. v) <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that "we must not seek religion from the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who accepted the same things for sacred, as did the people; and gave utterance in the schools to various and contrary opinions about the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of their gods, and the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." This <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was embraced also by certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> [The Helcesaitae], who affirmed that it is not wrong for one who is seized in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> to worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> outwardly so long as he keeps the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in his heart.

<p>But this is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For since outward worship is a sign of the inward worship, just as it is a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> lie to affirm the contrary of what one holds inwardly of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> so too is it a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> falsehood to pay outward worship to anything counter to the sentiments of one's heart. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> condemns Seneca (De Civ. Dei vi, 10) in that "his worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> was so much the more infamous forasmuch as the things he did dishonestly were so done by him that the people <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him to act honestly."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Neither in the Tabernacle or Temple of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, nor again now in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are images set up that the worship of latria may be paid to them, but for the purpose of signification, in order that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the excellence of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> may be impressed and confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. It is different with the image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to which latria is due on account of His Divinity, as we shall state in the III, 25, 3.

<p>The Replies to the Second and Third Objections are evident from what has been said above.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether idolatry is the gravest of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is not the gravest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The worst is opposed to the best (Ethic. viii, 10). But interior worship, which consists of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is better than external worship. Therefore unbelief, <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which are opposed to internal worship, are graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> than <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, which is opposed to external worship.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the more grievous it is. Now, seemingly, a man acts more directly against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by blaspheming, or denying the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, than by giving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> worship to another, which pertains to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and denial of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> than <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems that lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are punished with greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> was punished with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse26">Romans 1:26</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xx, 5): "Neither do we say that you," viz. the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichees</a>, "are <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, or a sect of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, but that you bear a certain likeness to them since you worship many gods: and yet you are much worse than they are, for they worship things that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, but should not be worshiped as gods, whereas you worship things that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> not at all." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> depravity is more grievous than <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> on <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse9">Galatians 4:9</a>, "How turn you again to the weak and needy elements?" says: "The observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, to which they were then addicted, was a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> almost equal to the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, to which they had been given before their conversion." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is not the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the saying of <a href="../bible/lev015.htm#verse25">Leviticus 15:25</a>, about the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> suffering from an issue of blood, says: "Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but especially <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be considered in two ways. First, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself, and thus <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For just as the most heinous crime in an earthly commonwealth would seem to be for a man to give royal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to another than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> king, since, so far as he is concerned, he disturbs the whole order of the commonwealth, so, in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which indeed are the greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the greatest of all seems to be for a man to give <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to a creature, since, so far as he is concerned, he sets up another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the world, and lessens the divine sovereignty. Secondly, the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be considered on the part of the sinner. Thus the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> knowingly is said to be graver than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: and in this way nothing hinders <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, if they knowingly corrupt the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they have received, from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> more grievously than idolaters who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Furthermore other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be more grievous on account of greater contempt on the part of the sinner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Idolatry presupposes internal unbelief, and to this it adds undue worship. But in a case of external <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> without internal unbelief, there is an additional <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of falsehood, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Idolatry includes a grievous <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, inasmuch as it deprives <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the singleness of His dominion and denies the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to punishment that it be against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whereby another <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is punished needs to be more manifest, in order that it may make the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> more hateful to himself and to others; but it need not be a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and in this way the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is less grievous than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. But since it is more manifest, it is assigned as a fitting punishment of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, in order that, as by <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> abuses the order of the divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, so by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> he may suffer confusion from the abuse of his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Even as to the genus of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the Manichean <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is more grievous than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of other idolaters, because it is more derogatory to the divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, since they set up two gods in opposition to one another, and hold many vain and fabulous fancies about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is different with other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who confess their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and worship Him alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> during the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not quite equal to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> as to the genus of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but almost equal, because both are <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of pestiferous <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the cause of idolatry was on the part of man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> was not on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. On <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is nothing but either <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or guilt. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> could not be on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since rather does <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> dictate that there is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that divine worship should not be paid to the dead or to inanimate beings. Likewise, neither could <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> have its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the part of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since "a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tree cannot bring forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit," according to <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse18">Matthew 7:18</a>: nor again could it be on the part of guilt, because, according to <a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse27">Wisdom 14:27</a>, "the worship of abominable <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and the beginning and end of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those things which have a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are found among men at all times. Now <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> was not always, but is stated [Peter Comestor, Hist. Genes. xxxvii, xl] to have been originated either by Nimrod, who is related to have forced men to worship fire, or by Ninus, who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the statue of his father Bel to be worshiped. Among the Greeks, as related by <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. viii, 11), Prometheus was the first to set up statues of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> say that Ismael was the first to make <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of clay. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> ceased to a great extent in the sixth age. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> had no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 6): "It was not possible to learn, for the first time, except from their" (i.e. the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>') "teaching, what each of them desired or disliked, and by what name to invite or compel him: so as to give birth to the magic arts and their professors": and the same observation seems to apply to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> had no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse14">Wisdom 14:14</a>): "By the vanity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> they," i.e. <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, "came into the world."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Idolatry had a twofold <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. One was a dispositive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; this was on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and in three ways. First, on account of his inordinate affections, forasmuch as he gave other men divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, through either <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> or revering them too much. This <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is assigned (<a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse15">Wisdom 14:15</a>): "A father being afflicted with bitter grief, made to himself the image of his son, who was quickly taken away: and him who then had died as a man he began to worship as a god." The same passage goes on to say (<a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse21">Wisdom 14:21</a>) that "men serving either their affection, or their kings, gave the incommunicable name [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'names']," i.e. of the Godhead, "to stones and wood." Secondly, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> pleasure in representations, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Poet. iv), wherefore as soon as the uncultured <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> saw <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> images skillfully fashioned by the diligence of the craftsman, he gave them divine worship; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/wis013.htm#verse11">Wisdom 13:11-17</a>): "If an artist, a carpenter, hath cut down a tree, proper for his use, in the wood . . . and by the skill of his art fashioneth it, and maketh it like the image of a man . . . and then maketh <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to it, inquiring concerning his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and his children, or his marriage." Thirdly, on account of their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as through failing to consider His excellence men gave divine worship to certain creatures, on account of their beauty or power, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/wis013.htm#verse1">Wisdom 13:1-2</a>): "All men . . . neither by attending to the works have acknowledged who was the workman, but have <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a> either the fire, or the wind, or the swift air, or the circle of the stars, or the great water, or the sun and the moon, to be the gods that rule the world."

<p>The other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> was completive, and this was on the part of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who offered themselves to be worshipped by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, by giving answers in the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and doing things which to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> seemed marvelous. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/psa095.htm#verse5">Psalm 95:5</a>): "All the gods of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The dispositive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> was, on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, a defect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, either through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, or disorder in his affections, as stated above; and this pertains to guilt. Again, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is stated to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, beginning and end of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because there is no kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> does not produce at some time, either through leading expressly to that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> it, or through being an occasion thereof, either as a beginning or as an end, in so far as certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were employed in the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; such as homicides, mutilations, and so forth. Nevertheless certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may precede <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and dispose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> thereto.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There was no <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> in the first age, owing to the recent remembrance of the creation of the world, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> still retained in his mind the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On the sixth age <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> was banished by the doctrine and power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who triumphed over the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers the consummative <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.
