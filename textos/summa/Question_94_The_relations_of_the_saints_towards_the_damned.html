<h1>Question 94. The relations of the saints towards the damned</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5094.htm#article1"> Do the saints see the sufferings of the damned?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5094.htm#article2"> Do they pity them?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5094.htm#article3"> Do they rejoice in their sufferings?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the blessed in heaven will see the sufferings of the damned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the blessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> will not see the sufferings of the damned. For the damned are more cut off from the blessed than wayfarers. But the blessed do not see the deeds of wayfarers: wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse16">Isaiah 63:16</a>, "<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> hath not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> us," says: "The dead, even the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what the living, even their own children, are doing" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, De cura pro mortuis xiii, xv]. Much less therefore do they see the sufferings of the damned.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, perfection of vision depends on the perfection of the visible object: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 4) that "the most perfect operation of the sense of sight is when the sense is most disposed with reference to the most beautiful of the objects which fall under the sight." Therefore, on the other hand, any deformity in the visible object redounds to the imperfection of the sight. But there will be no imperfection in the blessed. Therefore they will not see the sufferings of the damned wherein there is extreme deformity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse24">Isaiah 66:24</a>): "They shall go out and see the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me"; and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "The <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> will go out by understanding or seeing manifestly, so that they may be urged the more to praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nothing should be denied the blessed that belongs to the perfection of their beatitude. Now everything is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the more for being compared with its contrary, because when contraries are placed beside one another they become more conspicuous. Wherefore in order that the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> may be more delightful to them and that they may render more copious thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for it, they are allowed to see perfectly the sufferings of the damned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> speaks of what the departed <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are able to do by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: for it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> all that happens to the living. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> distinctly all that happens both to wayfarers and to the damned. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xii) that <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job's</a> words (<a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse21">14:21</a>), "'Whether his children come to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> or dishonour, he shall not understand,' do not apply to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, because since they possess the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> within them, we cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that external things are unknown to them." [Concerning this Reply, Cf. I, 89, 8].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the beauty of the thing seen conduces to the perfection of vision, there may be deformity of the thing seen without imperfection of vision: because the images of things whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> contraries are not themselves contrary. Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who has most perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> sees all things, beautiful and deformed.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the blessed pity the unhappiness of the damned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the blessed pity the unhappiness of the damned. For pity proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> [Cf. II-II, 30]; and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> will be most perfect in the blessed. Therefore they will most especially pity the sufferings of the damned.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the blessed will never be so far from taking pity as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is. Yet in a sense <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> compassionates our afflictions, wherefore He is said to be merciful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whoever pities another shares somewhat in his unhappiness. But the blessed cannot share in any unhappiness. Therefore they do not pity the afflictions of the damned.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Mercy or compassion may be in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in two ways: first by way of passion, secondly by way of choice. In the blessed there will be no passion in the lower powers except as a result of the reason's choice. Hence compassion or mercy will not be in them, except by the choice of reason. Now mercy or compassion comes of the reason's choice when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> wishes another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be dispelled: wherefore in those things which, in accordance with reason, we do not wish to be dispelled, we have no such compassion. But so long as sinners are in this world they are in such a state that without prejudice to the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> they can be taken away from a state of unhappiness and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to a state of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Consequently it is possible to have compassion on them both by the choice of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>--in which sense <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the blessed are said to pity them by desiring their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>--and by passion, in which way they are pitied by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men who are in the state of wayfarers. But in the future state it will be impossible for them to be taken away from their unhappiness: and consequently it will not be possible to pity their sufferings according to right reason. Therefore the blessed in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> will have no pity on the damned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is the principle of pity when it is possible for us out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to wish the cessation of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> unhappiness. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> cannot desire this for the damned, since it would be contrary to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Consequently the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be merciful, in so far as He succors those whom it is befitting to be released from their afflictions in accordance with the order of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: not as though He pitied the damned except perhaps in punishing them less than they deserve.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the blessed rejoice in the punishment of the wicked?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the blessed do not rejoice in the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For rejoicing in another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> pertains to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. But there will be no <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> in the blessed. Therefore they will not rejoice in the unhappiness of the damned.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the blessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> will be in the highest degree conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not rejoice in our afflictions. Therefore neither will the blessed rejoice in the afflictions of the damned.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is blameworthy in a wayfarer has no place whatever in a comprehensor. Now it is most reprehensible in a wayfarer to take pleasure in the pains of others, and most praiseworthy to grieve for them. Therefore the blessed nowise rejoice in the punishment of the damned.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa057.htm#verse11">Psalm 57:11</a>): "The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge."

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/isa056.htm#verse24">Isaiah 56:24</a>): "They shall satiate [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'They shall be a loathsome sight to all flesh.'] the sight of all flesh." Now satiety denotes refreshment of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Therefore the blessed will rejoice in the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may be a matter of rejoicing in two ways. First directly, when one rejoices in a thing as such: and thus the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will not rejoice in the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Secondly, indirectly, by reason namely of something annexed to it: and in this way the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will rejoice in the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, by considering therein the order of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and their own deliverance, which will fill them with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And thus the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and their own deliverance will be the direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the blessed: while the punishment of the damned will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it indirectly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To rejoice in another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as such belongs to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, but not to rejoice in another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by reason of something annexed to it. Thus a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> sometimes rejoices in his own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as when we rejoice in our own afflictions, as helping us to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> life: "My brethren, count it all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> when you shall fall into divers <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>" (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse2">James 1:2</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rejoices not in punishments as such, He rejoices in them as being ordered by His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is not praiseworthy in a wayfarer to rejoice in another's afflictions as such: yet it is praiseworthy if he rejoice in them as having something annexed. However it is not the same with a wayfarer as with a comprehensor, because in a wayfarer the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> often forestall the judgment of reason, and yet sometimes such <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are praiseworthy, as indicating the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as in the case of shame pity and repentance for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: whereas in a comprehensor there can be no passion but such as follows the judgment of reason.
