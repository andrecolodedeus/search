<h1>Question 94. The state and condition of the first man as regards his intellect</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1094.htm#article1"> Did the first man see the Essence of God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1094.htm#article2"> Could he see the separate substances, that is, the angels?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1094.htm#article3"> Did he possess all knowledge?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1094.htm#article4"> Could he err or be deceived?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the first man saw God through His Essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His Essence. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in the vision of the Divine Essence. But the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, "while established in paradise, led a life of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in the enjoyment of all things," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 11). And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10): "If <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was gifted with the same tastes as now, how <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> must he have been in paradise, that place of ineffable <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>!" Therefore the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in paradise saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His Essence.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, loc. cit.) that "the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lacked nothing which his good-will might obtain." But our good-will can obtain nothing better than the vision of the Divine Essence. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His Essence.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> is His Essence is whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen without a medium or enigma. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the state of innocence "saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately," as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a> asserts (Sent. iv, D, i). He also saw without an enigma, for an enigma implies obscurity, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 9). Now, obscurity resulted from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the primitive state saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His Essence.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse46">1 Corinthians 15:46</a>): "That was not first which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, but that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>." But to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His Essence is most <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Therefore the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the primitive state of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> life did not see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His Essence.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did not see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His Essence if we consider the ordinary state of that life; unless, perhaps, it be said that he saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a vision, when "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cast a deep sleep upon <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>" (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse21">Genesis 2:21</a>). The reason is because, since in the Divine Essence is beatitude itself, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of a man who sees the Divine Essence has the same relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as a man has to beatitude. Now it is clear that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot willingly be turned away from beatitude, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> he desires it, and shuns unhappiness. Wherefore no one who sees the Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can willingly turn away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which means to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence all who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His Essence are so firmly established in the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> they can never <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> did <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is clear that he did not see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His Essence.

<p>Nevertheless he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with a more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than we do now. Thus in a sense his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was midway between our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the present state, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> we shall have in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, when we see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His Essence. To make this clear, we must consider that the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> through His Essence is contradistinguished from the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> through His creatures. Now the higher the creature is, and the more like it is to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the more clearly is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seen in it; for instance, a man is seen more clearly through a mirror in which his image is the more clearly expressed. Thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen in a much more perfect manner through His intelligible effects than through those which are only sensible or corporeal. But in his present state <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is impeded as regards the full and clear consideration of intelligible creatures, because he is distracted by and occupied with sensible things. Now, it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse30">Ecclesiastes 7:30</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> right." And <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made right by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this sense, that in him the lower powers were subjected to the higher, and the higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was made so as not to be impeded by the lower. Wherefore the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not impeded by exterior things from a clear and steady <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the intelligible effects which he perceived by the radiation of the first <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whether by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or by a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 33) that, "perhaps <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> used to speak to the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as He speaks to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; by shedding on his mind a ray of the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, yet without bestowing on him the experience of which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are capable in the participation of the Divine Essence." Therefore, through these intelligible effects of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> then more clearly than we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him now.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Man was <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in paradise, but not with that perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to which he was destined, which consists in the vision of the Divine Essence. He was, however, endowed with "a life of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in a certain measure," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 18), so far as he was gifted with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> integrity and perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a well-ordered will; but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have been ill-ordered had he wished to have, while in the state of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, what had been promised to him as a reward.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A medium (of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>) is twofold; one through which, and, at the same time, in which, something is seen, as, for example, a man is seen through a mirror, and is seen with the mirror: another kind of medium is that whereby we attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of something unknown; such as the medium in a demonstration. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was seen without this second kind of medium, but not without the first kind. For there was no need for the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by demonstration drawn from an effect, such as we need; since he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> simultaneously in His effects, especially in the intelligible effects, according to His capacity. Again, we must remark that the obscurity which is implied in the word enigma may be of two kinds: first, so far as every creature is something obscure when compared with the immensity of the Divine light; and thus <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in an enigma, because he saw Him in a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> effect: secondly, we may take obscurity as an effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is impeded in the consideration of intelligible things by being preoccupied with sensible things; in which sense <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> did not see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in an enigma.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Adam in the state of innocence saw the angels through their essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, in the state of innocence, saw the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> through their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dialog. iv, 1): "In paradise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was accustomed to enjoy the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and by purity of heart and loftiness of vision to have the company of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the present state is impeded from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> by union with a corruptible body which "is a load upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," as is written <a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom 9:15</a>. Wherefore the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can see separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, as above explained (89, 2). But the body of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not a load upon his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for the latter was not corruptible. Therefore he was able to see separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> another separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> itself (De Causis xiii). But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> itself. Therefore it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as ours. But our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> cannot now understand separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Therefore neither could <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The state of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be distinguished in two ways.

<p>First, from a diversity of mode in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and in this point the state of the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is distinguished from the state of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> joined to the body.

<p>Secondly, the state of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is distinguished in relation to integrity and corruption, the state of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> remaining the same: and thus the state of innocence is distinct from the state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in the state of innocence, was adapted to perfect and govern the body; wherefore the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to have been made into a "living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"; that is, a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> giving life to the body--namely animal life. But he was endowed with integrity as to this life, in that the body was entirely subject to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, hindering it in no way, as we have said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now it is clear from what has been already said (84, 7; 85, 1; 89, 1) that since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is adapted to perfect and govern the body, as regards animal life, it is fitting that it should have that mode of understanding which is by turning to phantasms. Wherefore this mode of understanding was becoming to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also.

<p>Now, in virtue of this mode of understanding, there are three degrees of movement in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). The first is by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> "passing from exterior things to concentrate its powers on itself"; the second is by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ascending "so as to be associated with the united superior powers," namely the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; the third is when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is "led on" yet further "to the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>," that is, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the first movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from exterior things to itself, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is perfected. This is because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order to external things, as we have said above (Question 87, Article 3): and so by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> thereof, our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> perfectly, as an act through its object. And through the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation itself, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> perfectly, as a power through its proper act. But in the second movement we do not find perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Because, since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not understand by turning to phantasms, but by a far more excellent process, as we have said above (Question 55, Article 2); the above-mentioned mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself, is not sufficient to lead it to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Much less does the third movement lead to perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: for even the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves, by the fact that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> themselves, are not able to arrive at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Divine Substance, by reason of its surpassing excellence. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not see the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Nevertheless he had a more excellent mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> than we possess, because his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of intelligible things within him was more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> and fixed than our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And it was on account of this excellence of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says that "he enjoyed the company of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> spirits."

<p>This makes clear the reply to the first objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> fell short of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> regarding separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, was not owing to the fact that the body was a load upon it; but to the fact that its connatural object fell short of the excellence of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. We, in our present state, fall short on account of both these reasons.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not able to arrive at <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> by means of its self-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as we have shown above; for even each separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> others in its own measure.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the first man knew all things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things. For if he had such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> it would be either by acquired <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, or by connatural <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, or by infused <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Not, however, by acquired <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; for this kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is acquired by experience, as stated in Metaph. i, 1; and the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not then gained experience of all things. Nor through connatural <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, because he was of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as we are; and our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (De Anima iii, 4), is "like a clean tablet on which nothing is written." And if his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> came by infused <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it would have been of a different kind from ours, which we acquire from things themselves.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> have the same way of arriving at perfection. Now other men have not, from the beginning, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things, but they acquire it in the course of time according to their capacity. Therefore neither did <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things when he was first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the present state of life is given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in order that his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may advance in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; indeed, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> seems to be united to the body for that purpose. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have advanced in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in that state of life; therefore also in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore he was not endowed with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Man named the animals (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse20">Genesis 2:20</a>). But names should be adapted to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the animals' <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; and in like manner he was possessed of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all other things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, perfection comes before imperfection, as act precedes <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; for whatever is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is made actual only by something actual. And since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things not only for their own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but also that they might be the principles of other things; so creatures were produced in their perfect state to be the principles as regards others. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be the principle of another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not only by generation of the body, but also by instruction and government. Hence, as the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was produced in his perfect state, as regards his body, for the work of generation, so also was his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> established in a perfect state to instruct and govern others.

<p>Now no one can instruct others unless he has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and so the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in such a manner as to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all those things for which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude. And such are whatever are virtually contained in the first self-evident principles, that is, whatever <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Moreover, in order to direct his own life and that of others, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not only those things which can be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but also things surpassing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; because the life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end: just as it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in order to direct our own lives. Wherefore the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was endowed with such a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> as was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the direction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life in that state. But those things which cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> effort, and which are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the direction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, were not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; such as the thoughts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, future contingent events, and some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> facts, as for instance the number of pebbles in a stream; and the like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things by divinely infused <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Yet his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was not different from ours; as the eyes which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> born blind were not different from those given by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, as being the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was due to a degree of perfection which was not due to other men, as is clear from what is above explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> would have advanced in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, not in the number of things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but in the manner of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>; because what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> speculatively he would subsequently have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by experience. But as regards <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he would also have advanced as regards the number of things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, by further <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>; as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> advance by further enlightenment. Moreover there is no comparison between advance in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and advance in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; since one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be a principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to another, although he can be to another a principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether man in his first state could be deceived?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his primitive state could have been deceived. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse14">1 Timothy 2:14</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> being <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduced</a> was in the transgression."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. ii, D, xxi) that, "the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was not frightened at the serpent speaking, because she thought that he had received the faculty of speech from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But this was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. Therefore before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was deceived.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> that the farther off anything is from us, the smaller it seems to be. Now, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the eyes is not changed by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore this would have been the case in the state of innocence. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have been deceived in the size of what he saw, just as he is deceived now.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 2) that, in sleep the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> adheres to the images of things as if they were the things themselves. But in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have eaten and consequently have slept and dreamed. Therefore he would have been deceived, adhering to images as to realities.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of other men's thoughts, and of future contingent events, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). So if anyone had told him what was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> about these things, he would have been deceived.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. iii, 18): "To regard what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>; but is a punishment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> condemned."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> in the opinion of some, deception may mean two things; namely, any slight surmise, in which one adheres to what is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as though it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but without the assent of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>--or it may mean a firm <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Thus before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> could not be deceived in either of these ways as regards those things to which his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> extended; but as regards things to which his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> did not extend, he might have been deceived, if we take deception in the wide sense of the term for any surmise without assent of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. This opinion was held with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that it is not derogatory to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to entertain a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion in such matters, and that provided he does not assent rashly, he is not to be blamed.

<p>Such an opinion, however, is not fitting as regards the integrity of the primitive state of life; because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10), in that state of life "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was avoided without struggle, and while it remained so, no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> could <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>." Now it is clear that as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, so falsehood is its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 2). So that, as long as the state of innocence continued, it was impossible for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to assent to falsehood as if it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For as some perfections, such as clarity, were lacking in the bodily members of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, though no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> could be therein; so there could be in his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> the absence of some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion.

<p>This is clear also from the very rectitude of the primitive state, by virtue of which, while the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remained subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the lower faculties in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were subject to the higher, and were no impediment to their action. And from what has preceded (85, 6), it is clear that as regards its proper object the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is ever <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and hence it is never deceived of itself; but whatever deception occurs must be ascribed to some lower faculty, such as the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> or the like. Hence we see that when the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of judgment is free we are not deceived by such images, but only when it is not free, as is the case in sleep. Therefore it is clear that the rectitude of the primitive state was incompatible with deception of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Though the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was deceived before she <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, still it was not till she had already <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by interior <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 30) that "the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> could not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the words of the serpent, had she not already acquiesced in the love of her own power, and in a presumption of self-conceit."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> thought that the serpent had received this faculty, not as acting in accordance with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by virtue of some <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> operation. We need not, however, follow the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a> in this point.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Were anything presented to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> or sense of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things, he would not have been deceived, for his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> would have enabled him to judge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not accountable for what occurs during sleep; as he has not then the use of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, wherein consists <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> proper action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> If anyone had said something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a> as regards future contingencies, or as regards secret thoughts, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the primitive state would not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it was so: but he might have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that such a thing was possible; which would not have been to entertain a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion.

<p>It might also be said that he would have been divinely guided from above, so as not to be deceived in a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to which his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> did not extend.

<p>If any object, as some do, that he was not guided, when tempted, though he was then most in need of guidance, we reply that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had already <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in his heart, and that he failed to have recourse to the Divine aid.
