<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it was useful for laws to be framed by men?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not useful for laws to be framed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Because the purpose of every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be made <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thereby, as stated above (Question 92, Article 1). But men are more to be induced to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> willingly by means of admonitions, than against their will, by means of laws. Therefore there was no need to frame laws.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 4), "men have recourse to a judge as to animate <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." But animate <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is better than inanimate <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which contained in laws. Therefore it would have been better for the execution of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to be entrusted to the decision of judges, than to frame laws in addition.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is framed for the direction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, as is evident from what has been stated above (90, A1,2). But since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are about singulars, which are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> pertaining to the direction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions cannot be taken into sufficient consideration except by a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who looks into each one of them. Therefore it would have been better for <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> to be directed by the judgment of wise men, than by the framing of laws. Therefore there was no need of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 20): "Laws were made that in fear thereof <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> audacity might be held in check, that innocence might be safeguarded in the midst of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and that the dread of punishment might prevent the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> from doing harm." But these things are most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Therefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws should be made.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (63, 1; 94, 3), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; but the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> must be acquired by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by means of some kind of training. Thus we observe that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is helped by industry in his necessities, for instance, in food and clothing. Certain beginnings of these he has from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, viz. his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and his hands; but he has not the full complement, as other animals have, to whom <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has given sufficiency of clothing and food. Now it is difficult to see how <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could suffice for himself in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this training: since the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists chiefly in withdrawing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from undue pleasures, to which above all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is inclined, and especially the young, who are more capable of being trained. Consequently a man needs to receive this training from another, whereby to arrive at the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And as to those young people who are inclined to acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition, or by custom, or rather by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, paternal training suffices, which is by admonitions. But since some are found to be depraved, and prone to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and not easily amenable to words, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for such to be restrained from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by force and fear, in order that, at least, they might desist from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>-doing, and leave others in peace, and that they themselves, by being habituated in this way, might be brought to do willingly what hitherto they did from fear, and thus become <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. Now this kind of training, which compels through fear of punishment, is the discipline of laws. Therefore in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might have peace and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for laws to be framed: for, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 2), "as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the most noble of animals if he be perfect in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so is he the lowest of all, if he be severed from <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and righteousness"; because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can use his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> to devise means of satisfying his lusts and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, which other animals are unable to do.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Men who are well disposed are led willingly to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by being admonished better than by coercion: but men who are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evilly</a> disposed are not led to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> unless they are compelled.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 1), "it is better that all things be regulated by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, than left to be decided by judges": and this for three reasons. First, because it is easier to find a few wise men competent to frame right laws, than to find the many who would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to judge aright of each single case. Secondly, because those who make laws consider long beforehand what laws to make; whereas judgment on each single case has to be pronounced as soon as it arises: and it is easier for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to see what is right, by taking many instances into consideration, than by considering one solitary fact. Thirdly, because lawgivers judge in the abstract and of future events; whereas those who sit in judgment of things present, towards which they are affected by love, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, or some kind of cupidity; wherefore their judgment is perverted.

<p>Since then the animated <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the judge is not found in every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and since it can be deflected, therefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, whenever possible, for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to determine how to judge, and for very few matters to be left to the decision of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Certain <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> facts which cannot be covered by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> "have <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> to be committed to judges," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in the same passage: for instance, "concerning something that has happened or not happened," and the like.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether every human law is derived from the natural law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 7) that "the legal just is that which originally was a matter of indifference." But those things which arise from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> are not matters of indifference. Therefore the enactments of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws are not derived from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is contrasted with <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, as stated by <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. v, 4) and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 7). But those things which flow as conclusions from the general principles of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, as stated above (Question 94, Article 4). Therefore that which is established by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the same for all; since the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 7) that "the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> just is that which is equally valid everywhere." If therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws were derived from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, it would follow that they too are the same for all: which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is possible to give a reason for things which are derived from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. But "it is not possible to give the reason for all the legal enactments of the lawgivers," as the jurist says [Pandect. Justin. lib. i, ff, tit. iii, v; De Leg. et Senat.]. Therefore not all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws are derived from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully says (Rhet. ii): "Things which emanated from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and were approved by custom, were sanctioned by fear and reverence for the laws."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5) "that which is not just seems to be no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at all": wherefore the force of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> depends on the extent of its <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, from being right, according to the rule of reason. But the first rule of reason is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as is clear from what has been stated above (91, 2, ad 2). Consequently every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has just so much of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as it is derived from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But if in any point it deflects from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it is no longer a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> but a perversion of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p>But it must be noted that something may be derived from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> in two ways: first, as a conclusion from premises, secondly, by way of determination of certain generalities. The first way is like to that by which, in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, demonstrated conclusions are drawn from the principles: while the second mode is likened to that whereby, in the arts, general forms are particularized as to details: thus the craftsman needs to determine the general form of a house to some particular shape. Some things are therefore derived from the general principles of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, by way of conclusions; e.g. that "one must not kill" may be derived as a conclusion from the principle that "one should do harm to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>": while some are derived therefrom by way of determination; e.g. the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has it that the evil-doer should be punished; but that he be punished in this or that way, is a determination of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Accordingly both modes of derivation are found in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But those things which are derived in the first way, are contained in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> not as emanating therefrom exclusively, but have some force from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> also. But those things which are derived in the second way, have no other force than that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking of those enactments which are by way of determination or specification of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument avails for those things that are derived from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, by way of conclusions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The general principles of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> cannot be applied to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the same way on account of the great variety of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs: and hence arises the diversity of positive laws among various people.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> These words of the Jurist are to be understood as referring to decisions of rulers in determining particular points of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>: on which determinations the judgment of expert and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> men is based as on its principles; in so far, to wit, as they see at once what is the best thing to decide.

<p>Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 11) that in such matters, "we ought to pay as much attention to the undemonstrated sayings and opinions of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who surpass us in experience, age and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as to their demonstrations."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Isidore's description of the quality of positive law is appropriate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore's</a> description of the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not appropriate, when he says (Etym. v, 21): "Law shall be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, possible to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to the custom of the country, suitable to place and time, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, useful; clearly expressed, lest by its obscurity it lead to misunderstanding; framed for no private benefit, but for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Because he had previously expressed the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in three <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, saying that "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is anything founded on reason, provided that it foster religion, be helpful to discipline, and further the common weal." Therefore it was needless to add any further <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> to these.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Justice is included in honesty, as Tully says (De Offic. vii). Therefore after saying "honest" it was superfluous to add "just."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is condivided with custom, according to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. ii, 10). Therefore it should not be stated in the definition of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that it is "according to the custom of the country."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a thing may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in two ways. It may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> simply, because it cannot be otherwise: and that which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in this way, is not subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment, wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not concerned with <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of this kind. Again a thing may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for an end: and this <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> is the same as usefulness. Therefore it is superfluous to say both "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>" and "useful."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whenever a thing is for an end, its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> must be determined proportionately to that end; as the form of a saw is such as to be suitable for cutting (Phys. ii, text. 88). Again, everything that is ruled and measured must have a form proportionate to its rule and measure. Now both these <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are verified of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: since it is both something ordained to an end; and is a rule or measure ruled or measured by a higher measure. And this higher measure is twofold, viz. the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, as explained above (2; 93, 3). Now the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is to be useful to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as the jurist states [Pandect. Justin. lib. xxv, ff., tit. iii; De Leg. et Senat.]. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> in determining the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, lays down, at first, three <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>; viz. that it "foster religion," inasmuch as it is proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>; that it be "helpful to discipline," inasmuch as it is proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; and that it "further the common weal," inasmuch as it is proportionate to the utility of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>.

<p>All the other <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> mentioned by him are reduced to these three. For it is called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> because it fosters religion. And when he goes on to say that it should be "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, possible to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to the customs of the country, adapted to place and time," he implies that it should be helpful to discipline. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> discipline depends on first on the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, to which he refers by saying "just": secondly, it depends on the ability of the agent; because discipline should be adapted to each one according to his ability, taking also into account the ability of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (for the same burdens should be not laid on children as adults); and should be according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> customs; since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot live alone in society, paying no heed to others: thirdly, it depends on certain circumstances, in respect of which he says, "adapted to place and time." The remaining words, "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, useful," etc. mean that <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should further the common weal: so that "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>" refers to the removal of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; "usefulness" to the attainment of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; "clearness of expression," to the need of preventing any harm ensuing from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> itself. And since, as stated above (Question 90, Article 2), <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, this is expressed in the last part of the description.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Isidore's division of human laws is appropriate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> wrongly divided <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> statutes or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (Etym. v, 4, seqq.). For under this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> he includes the "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>," so called, because, as he says, "nearly all nations use it." But as he says, "<a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is that which is common to all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of nations is not contained under positive <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but rather under <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those laws which have the same force, seem to differ not formally but only materially. But "statutes, decrees of the commonalty, senatorial decrees," and the like which he mentions (Etym. v, 9), all have the same force. Therefore they do not differ, except materially. But art takes no notice of such a distinction: since it may go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Therefore this division of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws is not appropriate.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as, in the state, there are princes, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and soldiers, so are there other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> offices. Therefore it seems that, as this division includes "military <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>," and "public <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>," referring to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and magistrates; so also it should include other laws pertaining to other offices of the state.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, those things that are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> should be passed over. But it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that it be framed by this or that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore it is unreasonable to divide laws according to the names of lawgivers, so that one be called the "Cornelian" <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, another the "Falcidian" <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, etc.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The authority of <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Objection 1) suffices.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing can of itself be divided in respect of something contained in the notion of that thing. Thus a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> either rational or irrational is contained in the notion of animal: and therefore animal is divided properly and of itself in respect of its being rational or irrational; but not in the point of its being white or black, which are entirely beside the notion of animal. Now, in the notion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, many things are contained, in respect of any of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can be divided properly and of itself. For in the first place it belongs to the notion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, to be derived from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as explained above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). In this respect positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is divided into the "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>" and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">"civil law"</a>, according to the two ways in which something may be derived from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Because, to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of nations belong those things which are derived from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as conclusions from premises, e.g. just buyings and sellings, and the like, without which men cannot live together, which is a point of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> a social animal, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Polit. i, 2. But those things which are derived from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by way of particular determination, belong to the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, according as each state decides on what is best for itself.

<p>Secondly, it belongs to the notion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, to be ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the state. In this respect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> may be divided according to the different kinds of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who work in a special way for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: e.g. <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the people; princes, by governing the people; soldiers, by fighting for the safety of the people. Wherefore certain special kinds of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are adapted to these men.

<p>Thirdly, it belongs to the notion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, to be framed by that one who governs the community of the state, as shown above (Question 90, Article 3). In this respect, there are various <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws according to the various forms of government. Of these, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Polit. iii, 10) one is "monarchy," i.e. when the state is governed by one; and then we have "Royal Ordinances." Another form is "aristocracy," i.e. government by the best men or men of highest rank; and then we have the "Authoritative legal opinions" [Responsa Prudentum] and "Decrees of the Senate" [Senatus consulta]. Another form is "oligarchy," i.e. government by a few rich and powerful men; and then we have "Praetorian," also called "Honorary," <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Another form of government is that of the people, which is called "democracy," and there we have "Decrees of the commonalty" [Plebiscita]. There is also tyrannical government, which is altogether corrupt, which, therefore, has no corresponding <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Finally, there is a form of government made up of all these, and which is the best: and in this respect we have <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> sanctioned by the "Lords and Commons," as stated by <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. v, 4, seqq.).

<p>Fourthly, it belongs to the notion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions. In this respect, according to the various matters of which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> treats, there are various kinds of laws, which are sometimes named after their authors: thus we have the "Lex Julia" about <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, the "Lex Cornelia" concerning assassins, and so on, differentiated in this way, not on account of the authors, but on account of the matters to which they refer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of nations is indeed, in some way, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in so far as he is a reasonable being, because it is derived from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> by way of a conclusion that is not very remote from its premises. Wherefore men easily agreed thereto. Nevertheless it is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, especially it is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> which is common to all animals.

<p>The Replies to the other Objections are evident from what has been said.
