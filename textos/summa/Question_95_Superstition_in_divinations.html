<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether divination is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Divination is derived from something "divine": and things that are divine pertain to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 1): "Who dares to say that learning is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>?" and again: "I could nowise admit that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> can be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." But some arts are divinatory, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (De Memor. i): and <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> itself would seem to pertain to a certain <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there is no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclines only to its like. But men by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination seek to foreknow future events; and this belongs to <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 18:10-11</a>): "Neither let there be found among you . . . any one that consulteth pythonic spirits, or fortune tellers": and it is stated in the Decretals (26, qu. v, can. Qui divinationes): "Those who seek for divinations shall be liable to a penance of five years' duration, according to the fixed grades of penance."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Divination denotes a foretelling of the future. The future may be foreknown in two ways: first in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, secondly in itself. Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of the future are threefold: for some produce their effects, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> and always; and such like future effects can be foreknown and foretold with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, from considering their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, even as astrologers foretell a coming eclipse. Other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> produce their effects, not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> and always, but for the most part, yet they rarely fail: and from such like <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> their future effects can be foreknown, not indeed with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, but by a kind of conjecture, even as astrologers by considering the stars can foreknow and foretell things concerning rains and droughts, and physicians, concerning health and death. Again, other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, considered in themselves, are indifferent; and this is chiefly the case in the rational powers, which stand in relation to opposites, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> [Metaph. viii, 2,5,8. Such like effects, as also those which ensue from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> by chance and in the minority of instances, cannot be foreknown from a consideration of their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, because these <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> have no determinate inclination to produce these effects. Consequently such like effects cannot be foreknown unless they be considered in themselves. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot consider these effects in themselves except when they are present, as when he sees <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> running or walking: the consideration of such things in themselves before they occur is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who alone in His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> sees the future as though it were present, as stated in I, 14, 13; I, 57, 3; I, 86, 4. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/isa041.htm#verse23">Isaiah 41:23</a>): "Show the things that are to come hereafter, and we shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that ye are gods." Therefore if anyone presume to foreknow or foretell such like future things by any means whatever, except by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a>, he manifestly usurps what belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is for this reason that certain men are called divines: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. viii, 9): "They are called divines, as though they were full of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For they pretend to be filled with the Godhead, and by a deceitful <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> they forecast the future to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>."

<p>Accordingly it is not called <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, if a man foretells things that happen of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, or in the majority of instances, for the like can be foreknown by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: nor again if anyone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> other contingent future things, through <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a>: for then he does not divine, i.e. <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> something divine, but rather receives something divine. Then only is a man said to divine, when he usurps to himself, in an undue manner, the foretelling of future events: and this is manifestly a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and for this reason <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in his commentary on <a href="../bible/mic003.htm#verse9">Micah 3:9, seqq.</a> that "<a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is always taken in an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> sense."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Divination takes its name not from a rightly ordered share of something divine, but from an undue usurpation thereof, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There are certain arts for the foreknowledge of future events that occur of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> or frequently, and these do not pertain to <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>. But there are no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> arts or <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of other future events, but only vain inventions of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> deceit, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Man has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> means, but not by the undue means of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether divination is a species of superstition?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. The same thing cannot be a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of diverse genera. Now <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is apparently a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of curiosity, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Vera Relig. xxxviii) [Cf. De Doctr. Christ. ii, 23,24; De Divin. Daem. 3. Therefore it is not, seemingly, a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as religion is due worship, so is superstition undue worship. But <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> does not seem to pertain to undue worship. Therefore it does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, superstition is opposed to religion. But in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion nothing is to be found corresponding as a contrary to <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says in his Peri Archon [The quotation is from his sixteenth <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on the <a href="../bible/num000.htm">Book of Numbers</a>]: "There is an operation of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in the administering of foreknowledge, comprised, seemingly, under the head of certain arts exercised by those who have enslaved themselves to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, by means of lots, omens, or the observance of shadows. I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that all these things are done by the operation of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>." Now, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 20,23), "whatever results from fellowship between <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and men is <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1; Q92,94), superstition denotes undue divine worship. Now a thing pertains to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in two ways: in one way, it is something offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as a sacrifice, an oblation, or something of the kind: in another way, it is something divine that is assumed, as stated above with regard to an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> (89, 4, ad 2). Wherefore superstition includes not only idolatrous <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but also recourse to the help of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> for the purpose of doing or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> something. But all <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> results from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' operation, either because the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are expressly invoked that the future may be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, or because the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> thrust themselves into futile searchings of the future, in order to entangle men's minds with vain conceits. Of this kind of vanity it is written (<a href="../bible/psa039.htm#verse5">Psalm 39:5</a>): "Who hath not regard to vanities and lying follies." Now it is vain to seek <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future, when one tries to get it from a source whence it cannot be foreknown. Therefore it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Divination is a kind of curiosity with regard to the end in view, which is foreknowledge of the future; but it is a kind of superstition as regards the mode of operation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This kind of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> pertains to the worship of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, inasmuch as one enters into a compact, tacit or express with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind is restrained from solicitude about temporal things: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> contains no institution for the foreknowledge of future events in temporal matters. On the other hand in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, which contained earthly promises, there were consultations about the future in connection with religious matters. Hence where it is written (<a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse19">Isaiah 8:19</a>): "And when they shall say to you: Seek of pythons and of diviners, who mutter in their enchantments," it is added by way of answer: "Should not the people seek of their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a vision for the living and the dead? [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'seek of their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the living of the dead?']"

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, however, there were some possessed of the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, who foretold many things about future events.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, however, there were some possessed of the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, who foretold many things about future events.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether we ought to distinguish several species of divination?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we should not distinguish several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>. Where the formality of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the same, there are not seemingly several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now there is one formality of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in all divinations, since they consist in entering into compact with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future. Therefore there are not several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> takes it <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its end, as stated above (I-II, 01, 3; I-II, 18, 6). But all <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is directed to one end, namely, the foretelling of the future. Therefore all divinations are of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, signs do not vary the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for whether one detracts by word writing or gestures, it is the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now divinations seem to differ merely according to the various signs whence the foreknowledge of the future is derived. Therefore there are not several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> enumerates various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> (Etym. viii, 9).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), all divinations seek to acquire foreknowledge of future events, by means of some counsel and help of a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, who is either expressly called upon to give his help, or else thrusts himself in secretly, in order to foretell certain future things unknown to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him in such manners as have been explained in I, 57, 3. When <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are expressly invoked, they are wont to foretell the future in many ways. Sometimes they offer themselves to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sight and hearing by mock apparitions in order to foretell the future: and this <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is called "prestigiation" because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> eyes are blindfolded [praestringuntur]. Sometimes they make use of dreams, and this is called "<a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by dreams": sometimes they employ apparitions or utterances of the dead, and this <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is called "necromancy," for as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> observes (Etym. viii) in Greek, <em>nekron</em> "means dead and <em>manteia</em> <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, because after certain incantations and the sprinkling of blood, the dead seem to come to life, to divine and to answer questions." Sometimes they foretell the future through living men, as in the case of those who are possessed: this is <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by "pythons," of whom <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says that "pythons are so called from Pythius Apollo, who was said to be the inventor of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>." Sometimes they foretell the future by means of shapes or signs which appear in inanimate beings. If these signs appear in some earthly body such as wood, iron or polished stone, it is called "geomancy," if in water "hydromancy," if in the air "aeromancy," if in fire "pyromancy," if in the entrails of animals sacrificed on the altars of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, "aruspicy."

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> which is practiced without express invocation of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> is of two kinds. The first is when, with a view to obtain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future, we take observations in the disposition of certain things. If one endeavor to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future by observing the position and movements of the stars, this belongs to "astrologers," who are also called "genethliacs," because they take note of the days on which people are born. If one observe the movements and cries of birds or of any animals, or the sneezing of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or the sudden movements of limbs, this belongs in general to "augury," which is so called from the chattering of birds [avium garritu], just as "auspice" is derived from watching birds [avium inspectione]. These are chiefly wont to be observed in birds, the former by the ear, the latter by the eye. If, however, these observations have for their object men's words uttered unintentionally, which someone twist so as to apply to the future that he wishes to foreknow, then it is called an "omen": and as Valerius Maximus [De Dict. Fact. Memor. i, 5 remarks, "the observing of omens has a touch of religion mingled with it, for it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be founded not on a chance movement, but on <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>. It was thus that when the Romans were deliberating whether they would change their position, a centurion happened to exclaim at the time: 'Standard-bearer, fix the banner, we had best stand here': and on hearing these words they took them as an omen, and abandoned their <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of advancing further." If, however, the observation regards the dispositions, that occur to the eye, of figures in certain bodies, there will be another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> that is taken from observing the lines of the hand is called "chiromancy," i.e. <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> of the hand (because <em>cheir</em> is the Greek for hand): while the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> which is taken from signs appearing in the shoulder-blades of an animal is called "spatulamancy."

<p>To this second <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, which is without express invocation of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, belongs that which is practiced by observing certain things done seriously by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the research of the occult, whether by drawing lots, which is called "geomancy"; or by observing the shapes resulting from molten lead poured into water; or by observing which of several sheets of paper, with or without writing upon them, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may happen to draw; or by holding out several unequal sticks and noting who takes the greater or the lesser. or by throwing dice, and observing who throws the highest score; or by observing what catches the eye when one opens a book, all of which are named "sortilege."

<p>Accordingly it is clear that there are three kinds of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>. The first is when the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are invoked openly, this comes under the head of "necromancy"; the second is merely an observation of the disposition or movement of some other being, and this belongs to "augury"; while the third consists in doing something in order to discover the occult; and this belongs to "sortilege." Under each of these many others are contained, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In all the aforesaid there is the same general, but not the same special, character of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for it is much more grievous to invoke the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> than to do things that deserve the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' interference.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> of the future or of the occult is the ultimate end whence <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> takes its general formality. But the various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are distinguished by their proper objects or matters, according as the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the occult is sought in various things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The things observed by diviners are considered by them, not as signs expressing what they already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, as happens in detraction, but as principles of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now it is evident that diversity of principles diversifies the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, even in demonstrative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether divination practiced by invoking the demons is unlawful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> practiced by invoking the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> is not unlawful. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did nothing unlawful, according to <a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse22">1 Peter 2:22</a>, "Who did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> asked the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>: "What is thy name?" and the latter replied: "My name is Legion, for we are many" (<a href="../bible/mar005.htm#verse9">Mark 5:9</a>). Therefore it seems lawful to question the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> about the occult.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> do not encourage those who ask unlawfully. Yet Samuel appeared to Saul when the latter inquired of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that had a divining spirit, concerning the issue of the coming <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> (<a href="../bible/1sa028.htm#verse8">1 Samuel 28:8, sqq.</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> that consists in questioning <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> is not unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems lawful to seek the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, if it be useful to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. But it is sometimes useful to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is hidden from us, and can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, as in the discovery of thefts. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by questioning <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> is not unlawful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 18:10-11</a>): "Neither let there be found among you . . . anyone that consulteth soothsayers . . . nor . . . that consulteth pythonic spirits."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by invoking <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> is unlawful for two reasons. The first is gathered from the principle of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, which is a compact made expressly with a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> by the very fact of invoking him. This is altogether unlawful; wherefore it is written against certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (<a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse15">Isaiah 28:15</a>): "You have said: We have entered into a league with death, and we have made a covenant with <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>." And still more grievous would it be if sacrifice were offered or reverence paid to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> invoked. The second reason is gathered from the result. For the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> who intends <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perdition endeavors, by his answers, even though he sometimes tells the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to accustom men to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him, and so to lead him on to something prejudicial to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, commenting on the words of <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse35">Luke 4:35</a>, "He rebuked him, saying: Hold thy peace," says: "Although the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> confessed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> put a stop to his speech, lest together with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he should publish his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and accustom us to care little for such things, however much he may seem to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, while we have the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, to seek <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede's</a> commentary on <a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse30">Luke 8:30</a>, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> inquired, not through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but in order that the disease, which he tolerated, being made public, the power of the Healer might shine forth more graciously." Now it is one thing to question a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> who comes to us of his own accord (and it is lawful to do so at times for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others, especially when he can be compelled, by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>) and another to invoke a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> in order to gain from him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things hidden from us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Ad Simplic. ii, 3), "there is nothing absurd in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that the spirit of the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, being about to smite the king with the divine sentence, was permitted to appear to him, not by the sway of magic art or power, but by some occult dispensation of which neither the witch nor Saul was aware. Or else the spirit of Samuel was not in reality aroused from his rest, but some phantom or mock apparition formed by the machinations of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and styled by <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> under the name of Samuel, just as the images of things are wont to be called by the names of those things."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> No temporal utility can compare with the harm to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> health that results from the research of the unknown by invoking the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether divination by the stars is unlawful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by the stars is not unlawful. It is lawful to foretell effects by observing their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: thus a physician foretells death from the disposition of the disease. Now the heavenly bodies are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of what takes place in the world, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by the stars is not unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> science originates from experiments, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. i, 1). Now it has been discovered through many experiments that the observation of the stars is a means whereby some future events may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> beforehand. Therefore it would seem not unlawful to make use of this kind of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is declared to be unlawful in so far as it is based on a compact made with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by the stars contains nothing of the kind, but merely an observation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures. Therefore it would seem that this <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is not unlawful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iv, 3): "Those astrologers whom they call mathematicians, I consulted without scruple; because they seemed to use no sacrifice, nor to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to any spirit for their divinations which art, however, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> piety rejects and condemns."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1 and 2), the operation of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> thrusts itself into those divinations which are based on <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and vain opinions, in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind may become entangled in vanity and falsehood. Now one makes use of a vain and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion if, by observing the stars, one desires to foreknow the future that cannot be forecast by their means. Wherefore we must consider what things can be foreknown by observing the stars: and it is evident that those things which happen of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> can be foreknown by this mean,: even so astrologers forecast a future eclipse.

<p>However, with regard to the foreknowledge of future events acquired by observing the stars there have been various opinions. For some have stated that the stars signify rather than <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the things foretold by means of their observation. But this is an unreasonable statement: since every corporeal sign is either the effect of that for which it stands (thus smoke signifies fire whereby it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>), or it proceeds from the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, so that by signifying the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in consequence it signifies the effect (thus a rainbow is sometimes a sign of fair weather, in so far as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fair weather). Now it cannot be said that the dispositions and movements of the heavenly bodies are the effect of future events; nor again can they be ascribed to some common higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, although they are referable to a common higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>. on the contrary the appointment of the movements and positions of the heavenly bodies by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> is on a different principle from the appointment of the occurrence of future contingencies, because the former are appointed on a principle of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, so that they always occur in the same way, whereas the latter are appointed on a principle of contingency, so that the manner of their occurrence is variable. Consequently it is impossible to acquire foreknowledge of the future from an observation of the stars, except in so far as effects can be foreknown from their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p>Now two kinds of effects escape the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of heavenly bodies. On the first place all effects that occur <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, whether in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs or in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, since, as it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Metaph. vi [Ed. Did. v, 3, an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> being has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, least of all a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, such as is the power of a heavenly body, because what occurs <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, neither is a "being" properly speaking, nor is "one"--for instance, that an earthquake occur when a stone falls, or that a treasure be discovered when a man digs a grave--for these and like occurrences are not one thing, but are simply several things. Whereas the operation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has always some one thing for its term, just as it proceeds from some one principle, which is the form of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing.

<p>In the second place, acts of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, which is the faculty of will and reason, escape the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of heavenly bodies. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or reason is not a body, nor the act of a bodily organ, and consequently neither is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, since it is in the reason, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> shows (De Anima iii, 4,9). Now no body can make an impression on an incorporeal body. Wherefore it is impossible for heavenly bodies to make a direct impression on the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will: for this would be to deny the difference between <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and sense, with which position <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> reproaches (De Anima iii, 3) those who held that "such is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as is the day which the father of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of gods," i.e. the sun or the heavens, "brings on" [Odyssey xviii, 135].

<p>Hence the heavenly bodies cannot be the direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> operations. Nevertheless they can be a dispositive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of an inclination to those operations, in so far as they make an impression on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, and consequently on the sensitive powers which are acts of bodily organs having an inclination for <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. Since, however, the sensitive powers obey reason, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> shows (De Anima iii, 11; Ethic. i, 13), this does not impose any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> on the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is able, by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, to act counter to the inclination of the heavenly bodies.

<p>Accordingly if anyone take observation of the stars in order to foreknow casual or fortuitous future events, or to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> future <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, his conduct is based on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and vain opinion; and so the operation of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> introduces itself therein, wherefore it will be a <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and unlawful <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>. On the other hand if one were to apply the observation of the stars in order to foreknow those future things that are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by heavenly bodies, for instance, drought or rain and so forth, it will be neither an unlawful nor a <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>.

<p>Wherefore the Reply to the First Objection is evident.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That astrologers not unfrequently forecast the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by observing the stars may be explained in two ways. First, because a great number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> follow their bodily <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, so that their actions are for the most part disposed in accordance with the inclination of the heavenly bodies: while there are few, namely, the wise alone, who moderate these inclinations by their reason. The result is that astrologers in many cases foretell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, especially in public occurrences which depend on the multitude. Secondly, because of the interference of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 17): "When astrologers tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it must be allowed that this is due to an instinct that, unknown to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, lies hidden in his mind. And since this happens through the action of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> and lying spirits who desire to deceive <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for they are permitted to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> certain things about temporal affairs." Wherefore he concludes: "Thus a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> should beware of astrologers, and of all impious diviners, especially of those who tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, lest his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> become the dupe of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and by making a compact of partnership with them enmesh itself in their fellowship."

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Third Objection.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether divination by dreams is unlawful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by dreams is not unlawful. It is not unlawful to make use of divine instruction. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are instructed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in dreams, for it is written (<a href="../bible/job033.htm#verse15">Job 33:15-16</a>): "By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, and they are sleeping in their beds, then He," <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to wit, "openeth the ears of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn." Therefore it is not unlawful to make use of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by dreams.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those who <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpret dreams</a>, properly speaking, make use of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by dreams. Now we read of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men interpreting dreams: thus <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> interpreted the dreams of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> butler and of his chief baker (<a href="../bible/gen040.htm">Genesis 40</a>), and <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> interpreted the dream of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> (<a href="../bible/dan002.htm">Daniel 2</a> and <a href="../bible/dan004.htm">4</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by dreams is not unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is unreasonable to deny the common experiences of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Now it is the experience of all that dreams are significative of the future. Therefore it is useless to deny the efficacy of dreams for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, and it is lawful to listen to them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>): "Neither let there be found among you any one that . . . observeth dreams."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (A2,6), <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and unlawful when it is based on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion. Wherefore we must consider what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of foreknowing the future from dreams. Now dreams are sometimes the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of future occurrences; for instance, when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> mind becomes anxious through what it has seen in a dream and is thereby led to do something or avoid something: while sometimes dreams are signs of future happenings, in so far as they are referable to some common <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of both dreams and future occurrences, and in this way the future is frequently <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from dreams. We must, then, consider what is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of dreams, and whether it can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of future occurrences, or be cognizant of them.

<p>Accordingly it is to be observed that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of dreams is sometimes in us and sometimes outside us. The inward <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of dreams is twofold: one regards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in so far as those things which have occupied a man's thoughts and affections while awake recur to his <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> while asleep. A such like <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of dreams is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of future occurrences, so that dreams of this kind are related <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> to future occurrences, and if at any time they concur it will be by chance. But sometimes the inward <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of dreams regards the body: because the inward disposition of the body leads to the formation of a movement in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> consistent with that disposition; thus a man in whom there is abundance of cold humors dreams that he is in the water or snow: and for this reason physicians say that we should take note of dreams in order to discover internal dispositions.

<p>In like manner the outward <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of dreams is twofold, corporal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. It is corporal in so far as the sleeper's <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is affected either by the surrounding air, or through an impression of a heavenly body, so that certain images appear to the sleeper, in keeping with the disposition of the heavenly bodies. The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is sometimes referable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who reveals certain things to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in their dreams by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according <a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse6">Numbers 12:6</a>, "If there be among you a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream." Sometimes, however, it is due to the action of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> that certain images appear to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in their sleep, and by this means they, at times, reveal certain future things to those who have entered into an unlawful compact with them.

<p>Accordingly we must say that there is no unlawful <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> in making use of dreams for the foreknowledge of the future, so long as those dreams are due to <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a>, or to some <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> inward or outward, and so far as the efficacy of that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> extends. But it will be an unlawful and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> if it be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, with whom a compact has been made, whether explicit, through their being invoked for the purpose, or implicit, through the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> extending beyond its possible limits.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether divination by auguries, omens, and by like observations of external things is unlawful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by auguries, omens, and by like observations of external things is not unlawful. If it were unlawful <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men would not make use thereof. Now we read of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> that he paid attention to auguries, for it is related (<a href="../bible/gen044.htm#verse5">Genesis 44:5</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph's</a> steward said: "The cup which you have stolen is that in which my lord drinketh and in which he is wont to divine [augurari]": and he himself afterwards said to his brethren (<a href="../bible/gen044.htm#verse15">Genesis 44:15</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not that there is no one like me in the science of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divining</a>?" Therefore it is not unlawful to make use of this kind of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, birds <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> certain things regarding future occurrences of the seasons, according to <a href="../bible/jer008.htm#verse7">Jeremiah 8:7</a>, "The kite in the air hath <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> her time; the turtle, the swallow, and the stork have observed the time of their coming." Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> and comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it seems not unlawful to make use of the birds' <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future, and this is <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by augury.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Gedeon is numbered among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse32">Hebrews 11:32</a>). Yet Gedeon made use of an omen, when he listened to the relation and interpreting of a dream (<a href="../bible/jdg007.htm#verse15">Judges 7:15</a>): and Eliezer, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> servant, acted in like manner (<a href="../bible/gen024.htm#verse24">Genesis 24</a>). Therefore it seems that this kind of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> is not unlawful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>): "Neither let there be found among you anyone . . . that observeth omens."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The movements or cries of birds, and whatever dispositions one may consider in such things, are manifestly not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of future events: wherefore the future cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> therefrom as from its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. It follows therefore that if anything future can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from them, it will be because the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> from which they proceed are also the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of future occurrences or are cognizant of them. Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of dumb animals' actions is a certain instinct whereby they are inclined by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement, for they are not masters of their actions. This instinct may proceed from a twofold <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. On the first place it may be due to a bodily <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For since dumb animals have naught but a sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, every power of which is the act of a bodily organ, their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is subject to the disposition of surrounding bodies, and primarily to that of the heavenly bodies. Hence nothing prevents some of their actions from being signs of the future, in so far as they are conformed to the dispositions of the heavenly bodies and of the surrounding air, to which certain future events are due. Yet in this matter we must observe two things: first, that such observations must not be applied to the foreknowledge of future things other than those which can be foreknown from the movements of heavenly bodies, as stated above (A5,6): secondly, that they be not applied to other matters than those which in some way may have reference to these animals (since they acquire through the heavenly bodies a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and instinct about things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their life--such as changes resulting from rain and wind and so forth).

<p>In the second place, this instinct is produced by a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, namely, either by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as may be seen in the dove that descended upon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the raven that fed Elias, and the whale that swallowed and vomited <a href="../cathen/08497b.htm">Jonas</a>, or by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who make use of these actions of dumb animals in order to entangle our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> with vain opinions. This seems to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of all such like things; except omens, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> words which are taken for an omen are not subject to the disposition of the stars, yet are they ordered according to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> and sometimes according to the action of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p>Accordingly we must say that all such like divinations are <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and unlawful, if they be extended beyond the limits set according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [QQ. in Genes., qu. cxlv], when <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> said that there was no one like him in the science of divining, he spoke in joke and not seriously, referring perhaps to the common opinion about him: in this sense also spoke his steward.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The passage quoted refers to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that birds have about things concerning them; and in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things it is not unlawful to observe their cries and movements: thus from the frequent cawing of crows one might say that it will rain soon.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Gedeon listened to the recital and interpretation of a dream, seeing therein an omen, ordered by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> for his instruction. On like manner Eliezer listened to the damsel's words, having previously <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether divination by drawing lots is unlawful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by drawing lots is not unlawful, because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> on <a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse16">Psalm 30:16</a>, "My lots are in Thy hands," says: "It is not wrong to cast lots, for it is a means of ascertaining the divine will when a man is in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> There is, seemingly, nothing unlawful in the observances which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> relate as being practiced by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men. Now both in the Old and in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> we find <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men practicing the casting of lots. For it is related (<a href="../bible/jos007.htm#verse14">Joshua 7:14, sqq.</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a>, at the Lord's command, pronounced sentence by lot on Achan who had stolen of the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. Again Saul, by drawing lots, found that his son Jonathan had eaten honey (<a href="../bible/1sa014.htm#verse58">1 Samuel 14:58, sqq.</a>): <a href="../cathen/08497b.htm">Jonas</a>, when fleeing from the face of the Lord, was discovered and thrown into the sea (<a href="../bible/jon001.htm#verse7">Jonah 1:7, sqq.</a>): Zacharias was chosen by lot to offer <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse9">Luke 1:9</a>): and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> by drawing lots elected <a href="../cathen/10066a.htm">Matthias</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostleship</a> (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse26">Acts 1:26</a>). Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by lots is not unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fighting with the fists, or "monomachy," i.e. single combat as it is called, and trial by fire and water, which are called "popular" trials, seem to come under the head of sortilege, because something unknown is sought by their means. Yet these practices seem to be lawful, because David is related to have engaged in single combat with the Philistine (<a href="../bible/1sa017.htm#verse32">1 Samuel 17:32, sqq.</a>). Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by lot is not unlawful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written in the Decretals (XXVI, qu. v, can. Sortes): "We decree that the casting of lots, by which means you make up your mind in all your undertakings, and which the Fathers have condemned, is nothing but <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> and witchcraft. For which reason we wish them to be condemned altogether, and henceforth not to be mentioned among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and we forbid the practice thereof under pain of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), sortilege consists, properly speaking, in doing something, that by observing the result one may come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of something unknown. If by casting lots one seeks to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is to be given to whom, whether it be a possession, an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, a dignity, a punishment, or some action or other, it is called "sortilege of allotment"; if one seeks to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what ought to be done, it is called "sortilege of consultation"; if one seeks to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is going to happen, it is called "sortilege of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>." Now the actions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that are required for sortilege and their results are not subject to the dispositions of the stars. Wherefore if anyone practicing sortilege is so minded as though the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> requisite for sortilege depended for their result on the dispositions of the stars, his opinion is vain and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, and consequently is not free from the interference of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, so that a <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> of this kind is <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and unlawful.

<p>Apart from this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, however, the result of sortilegious acts must needs be ascribed to chance, or to some directing <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. If we ascribe it to chance, and this can only take place in "sortilege of allotment," it does not seem to imply any <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> other than vanity, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who, being unable to agree upon the division of something or other, are willing to draw lots for its division, thus leaving to chance what portion each is to receive.

<p>If, on the other hand, the decision by lot be left to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it is sometimes ascribed to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Thus we read (<a href="../bible/eze021.htm#verse21">Ezekiel 21:21</a>) that "the king of Babylon stood in the highway, at the head of two ways, seeking <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, shuffling arrows; he inquired of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and consulted entrails": sortilege of this kind is unlawful, and forbidden by the canons.

<p>Sometimes, however, the decision is left to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse33">Proverbs 16:33</a>, "Lots are cast into the lap, but they are disposed of by the Lord": sortilege of this kind is not wrong in itself, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares [Enarr. ii in Ps. xxx, serm. 2; cf. Objection 1.

<p>Yet this may happen to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in four ways. First, if one have recourse to lots without any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>: for this would seem to amount to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, commenting on the words of <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse8">Luke 1:8</a>, says: "He that is chosen by lot is not bound by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." Secondly, if even in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> one were to have recourse to lots without reverence. Hence, on the <a href="../cathen/01117a.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says (Super Act. Apost. i): "But if anyone, compelled by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, thinks that he ought, after the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> example, to consult <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by casting lots, let him take note that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves did not do so, except after calling together the assembly of the brethren and pouring forth <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Thirdly, if the Divine oracles be misapplied to earthly business. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad inquisit. Januar. ii; Ep. lv): "Those who tell fortunes from the Gospel pages, though it is to be hoped that they do so rather than have recourse to consulting the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, yet does this custom also displease me, that anyone should wish to apply the Divine oracles to worldly matters and to the vain things of this life." Fourthly, if anyone resort to the drawing of lots in ecclesiastical elections, which should be carried out by the inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Wherefore, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says (Super Act. Apost. i): "Before Pentecost the ordination of <a href="../cathen/10066a.htm">Matthias</a> was decided by lot," because as yet the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was not yet poured forth into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: "whereas the same <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> were ordained not by lot but by the choice of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>." It is different with earthly honors, which are directed to the disposal of earthly things: in elections of this kind men frequently have recourse to lots, even as in the distribution of earthly possessions.

<p>If, however, there be urgent <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> it is lawful to seek the divine judgment by casting lots, provided due reverence be observed. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Honor. ccxxviii), "If, at a time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do not agree as to which of them is to remain at his post lest all should flee, and which of them is to flee, lest all die and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be forsaken, should there be no other means of coming to an agreement, so far as I can see, they must be chosen by lot." Again he says (De Doctr. Christ. xxviii): "If thou aboundest in that which it behooves thee to give to him who hath not, and which cannot be given to two; should two come to you, neither of whom surpasses the other either in need or in some claim on thee, thou couldst not act more <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> than in choosing by lot to whom thou shalt give that which thou canst not give to both."

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First and Second Objections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The trial by hot iron or boiling water is directed to the investigation of someone's hidden <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by means of something done by a man, and in this it agrees with the drawing of lots. But in so far as a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> result is expected from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it surpasses the common generality of sortilege. Hence this kind of trial is rendered unlawful, both because it is directed to the judgment of the occult, which is reserved to the divine judgment, and because such like trials are not sanctioned by divine authority. Hence we read in a decree of Pope Stephen V [II, qu. v., can. Consuluist i]: "The sacred canons do not approve of extorting a confession from anyone by means of the trial by hot iron or boiling water, and no one must presume, by a <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> innovation, to practice what is not sanctioned by the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers. For it is allowable that public crimes should be judged by our authority, after the culprit has made spontaneous confession, or when <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> have been approved, with due regard to the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but hidden and unknown crimes must be left to Him Who alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the hearts of the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." The same would seem to apply to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> concerning duels, save that it approaches nearer to the common kind of sortilege, since no <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> effect is expected thereupon, unless the combatants be very unequal in strength or skill.
