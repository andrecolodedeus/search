<h1>Question 95. The gifts, or dowry, of the blessed</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5095.htm#article1"> Should any gifts be assigned to the blessed?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5095.htm#article2"> Does a gift differ from beatitude?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5095.htm#article3"> Is it fitting for Christ to have gifts?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5095.htm#article4"> Is this competent to the angels?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5095.htm#article5"> Are three gifts of the soul rightly assigned?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether any gifts should be assigned as dowry to the blessed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> should be assigned as <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> to the blessed. For a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> (Cod. v, 12, De jure dot. 20: Dig. xxiii, 3, De jure dot.) is given to the bridegroom for the upkeep of the burdens of marriage. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> resemble not the bridegroom but the bride, as being members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore they receive no <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is given not by the bridegroom's father, but by the father of the bride (Cod. v, 11, De dot. promiss., 1: Dig. xxiii, 2, De rit. nup.). Now all the beatific <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are bestowed on the blessed by the father of the bridegroom, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: "Every best <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> and every perfect <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is from above coming down from the Father of lights." Therefore these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> which are bestowed on the blessed should not be called a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in carnal marriage a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is given that the burdens of marriage may be the more easily borne. But in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage there are no burdens, especially in the state of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> triumphant. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> should be assigned to that state.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is not given save on the occasion of marriage. But a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage is contracted with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the state of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant. Therefore if a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is befitting the blessed, for the same reason it will be befitting the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are wayfarers. But it is not befitting the latter: and therefore neither is it befitting the blessed.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> pertains to external goods, which are styled goods of fortune: whereas the reward of the blessed will consist of internal goods. Therefore they should not be called a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse32">Ephesians 5:32</a>): "This is a great sacrament: but I speak in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." Hence it follows that the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage is signified by the carnal marriage. But in a carnal marriage the dowered bride is brought to the dwelling of the bridegroom. Therefore since the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are brought to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> dwelling when they are beatified, it would seem that they are dowered with certain <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p>Further, a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is appointed to carnal marriage for the ease of marriage. But the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage is more <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">blissful</a> than the carnal marriage. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> should be especially assigned thereto.

<p>Further, the adornment of the bride is part of the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are adorned when they are taken into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse10">Isaiah 61:10</a>, "He hath clothed me with the garments of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> . . . as a bride adorned with her jewels." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> have a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the blessed when they are brought into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are dowered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with certain <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> for their adornment, and this adornment is called their <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> by the masters. Hence the dower of which we speak now is defined thus: "The <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is the everlasting adornment of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body adequate to life, lasting for ever in <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">eternal bliss</a>." This description is taken from a likeness to the material <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> whereby the bride is adorned and the husband provided with an adequate support for his wife and children, and yet the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> remains inalienable from the bride, so that if the marriage union be severed it reverts to her. As to the reason of the name there are various opinions. For some say that the name "<a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>" is taken not from a likeness to the corporeal marriage, but according to the manner of speaking whereby any perfection or adornment of any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whatever is called an endowment; thus a man who is proficient in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is said to be endowed with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and in this sense ovid employed the word "endowment" (De Arte Amandi i, 538): "By whatever endowment thou canst please, strive to please." But this does not seem quite fitting, for whenever a term is employed to signify a certain thing principally, it is not usually transferred to another save by reason of some likeness. Wherefore since by its primary signification a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> refers to carnal marriage, it follows that in every other application of the term we must observe some kind of likeness to its principal signification. Consequently others say that the likeness consists in the fact that in carnal marriage a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is properly a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> bestowed by the bridegroom on the bride for her adornment when she is taken to the bridegroom's dwelling: and that this is shown by the words of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a> to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> and his sons (<a href="../bible/gen034.htm#verse12">Genesis 34:12</a>): "Raise the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>, and ask <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>," and from <a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse16">Exodus 22:16</a>: "If a man <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduce</a> a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> . . . and lie with her, he shall endow her, and have her to wife." Hence the adornment bestowed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, when they are brought into the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">abode of glory</a>, is called a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>. But this is clearly contrary to what jurists say, to whom it belongs to treat of these matters. For they say that a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>, properly speaking, is a donation on the part of the wife made to those who are on the part of the husband, in view of the marriage burden which the husband has to bear; while that which the bridegroom gives the bride is called "a donation in view of marriage." In this sense <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is taken (<a href="../bible/1ki009.htm#verse16">1 Kings 9:16</a>) where it is stated that "<a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, took Gezer . . . and gave it for a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> to his daughter, <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon's</a> wife." Nor do the authorities quoted <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> anything to the contrary. For although it is customary for a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> to be given by the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maiden</a>'s parents, it happens sometimes that the bridegroom or his father gives the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> instead of the bride's father; and this happens in two ways: either by reason of his very great love for the bride as in the case of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>'s father Hemor, who on account of his son's great love for the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maiden</a> wished to give the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> which he had a right to receive; or as a punishment on the bridegroom, that he should out of his own possessions give a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduced</a> by him, whereas he should have received it from the girl's father. In this sense <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> speaks in the passage quoted above. Wherefore in the opinion of others we should hold that in carnal marriage a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>, properly speaking, is that which is given by those on the wife's side to those on the husband's side, for the bearing of the marriage burden, as stated above. Yet the difficulty remains how this signification can be adapted to the case in point, since the heavenly adornments are given to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> spouse by the Father of the Bridegroom. This shall be made clear by replying to the objections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although in carnal marriage the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is given to the bridegroom for his use, yet the ownership and control belong to the bride: which is evident by the fact that if the marriage be dissolved, the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> reverts to the bride according to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (Cap. 1,2,3, De donat. inter virum et uxorem). Thus also in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage, the very adornments bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> bride, namely the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in her members, belong indeed to the Bridegroom, in so far as they conduce to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, yet to the bride as adorned thereby.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Father of the Bridegroom, that is of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> of the Father alone: while the Father of the bride is the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, since that which is effected in creatures belongs to the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. Hence in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage these endowments, properly speaking, are given by the Father of the bride rather than by the Father of the Bridegroom. Nevertheless, although this endowment is made by all the Persons, it may be in a manner appropriated to each Person. To the Person of the Father, as endowing, since He possesses authority; and fatherhood in relation to creatures is also appropriated to Him, so that He is Father of both Bridegroom and bride. To the Son it is appropriated, inasmuch as it is made for His sake and through Him: and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, inasmuch as it is made in Him and according to Him, since love is the reason of all giving [Cf. I, 38, 2].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which is effected by the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and that is the ease of marriage: while that which the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> removes, namely the marriage burden which is lightened thereby, belongs to it <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>: thus it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to make a man righteous, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> to make an ungodly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> righteous. Accordingly, though there are no burdens in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage, there is the greatest <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">gladness</a>; and that this gladness may be perfected the bride is dowered with <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, so that by their means she may be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happily</a> united with the bridegroom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is usually settled on the bride not when she is espoused, but when she is taken to the bridegroom's dwelling, so as to be in the presence of the bridegroom, since "while we are in the body we are absent from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>" (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 5:6</a>). Hence the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in this life are not called a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>, but those which are bestowed on them when they are received into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, where the Bridegroom delights them with <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">His presence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage inward comeliness is required, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/psa044.htm#verse14">Psalm 44:14</a>): "All the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the king's daughter is within," etc. But in carnal marriage outward comeliness is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Hence there is no need for a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> of this kind to be appointed in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage as in carnal marriage.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the dowry is the same as beatitude?</h2> <span class="stiki">Cf. I, 12, 7, ad 1; I-II, 4, 3</span>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is the same as beatitude. For as appears from the definition of <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> (1), the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is "the everlasting adornment of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is an adornment thereof. Therefore beatitude is a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> signifies something whereby the union of bride and bridegroom is rendered delightful. Now such is beatitude in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage. Therefore beatitude is a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (In Ps. 92) vision is "the whole <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of beatitude." Now vision is accounted one of the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a>. Therefore beatitude is a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, fruition gives <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Now fruition is a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> gives <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and thus beatitude is a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Consol. iii), "beatitude is a state made perfect by the aggregate of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things." Now the state of the blessed is perfected by the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> are part of beatitude.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> are given without <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>: whereas beatitude is not given, but is awarded in return for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Therefore beatitude is not a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p>Further, beatitude is one only, whereas the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> are several. Therefore beatitude is not a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p>Further, beatitude is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to that which is principal in him (Ethic. x, 7): whereas a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is also appointed to the body. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> and beatitude are not the same.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two opinions on this question. For some say that beatitude and <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> are the same in reality but differ in aspect: because <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whereas beatitude does not. But seemingly this will not stand, since beatitude consists in an operation, whereas a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is not an operation, but a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> or disposition. Wherefore according to others it must be stated that beatitude and <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> differ even in reality, beatitude being the perfect operation itself by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> or dispositions or any other <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> directed to this same perfect operation, so that they are directed to beatitude instead of being in it as parts thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Beatitude, properly speaking, is not an adornment of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but something resulting from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> adornment; since it is an operation, while its adornment is a certain comeliness of the blessed themselves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Beatitude is not directed to the union but is the union itself of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This union is by an operation, whereas the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> are <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> disposing to this same union.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Vision may be taken in two ways. First, actually, i.e. for the act itself of vision; and thus vision is not a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>, but beatitude itself. Secondly, it may be taken <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>, i.e. for the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby this act is elicited, namely the clarity of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is enlightened from above to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and thus it is a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> and the principle of beatitude, but not beatitude itself. The same answer applies to Objection 4.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Beatitude is the sum of all goods not as though they were <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> parts of beatitude, but as being in a way directed to beatitude, as stated above.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it is fitting that Christ should receive a dowry?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should receive a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, according to <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a>, "Who will reform the body of our lowness made like to the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also will have a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is given in likeness to a carnal marriage. Now there is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is peculiar to Him, namely of the two natures in one Person, in regard to which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in Him is said to have been espoused by the Word, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, De Consensu Evang. i, 40 has it on <a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse6">Psalm 18:6</a>, "He hath set His tabernacle in the sun," etc., and <a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse3">Apocalypse 21:3</a>, "Behold the tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with men." Therefore it is fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. iii) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to the Rule [Liber regularum] of <a href="../cathen/14721d.htm">Tyconius</a>, on account of the unity of the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystic body</a> that exists between the head and its members, calls Himself also the Bride and not only the Bridegroom, as may be gathered from <a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse10">Isaiah 61:10</a>, "As a bridegroom decked with a crown, and as a bride adorned with her jewels." Since then a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is due to the bride, it would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to receive a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is due to all the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the spouse. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse27">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>, "You are the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and members of member, i.e. of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is due to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has perfect vision, fruition, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Now these are the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is requisite between the bridegroom and the bride. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is nothing personally distinct from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Who is the Bridegroom, as stated in <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse29">John 3:29</a>, "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom." Therefore since the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is allotted to the bride or for the bride, it would seem unfitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to have a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p>Further, the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> does not both give and receive a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>. But it is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who gives <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a>. Therefore it is not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two opinions on this point. For some say that there is a threefold union in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. One is the union of concord, whereby He is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the bond of love; another is the union of condescension, whereby the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is united to the Divine; the third is the union whereby <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is united to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. They say, then, that as regards the first two unions it is fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to have the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> as such, but as regards the third, it is fitting for Him to have the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> in the most excellent degree, considered as to that in which they consist, but not considered as <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a>; because in this union <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the bridegroom and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the bride, and a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is given to the bride as regards property and control, although it is given to the bridegroom as to use. But this does not seem congruous. For in the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the Father by the concord of love, even if we consider Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is not said to be a marriage, since it implies no subjection such as is required in the bride towards the bridegroom. Nor again in the union of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the Divine, whether we consider the Personal union or that which regards the conformity of will, can there be a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>, properly speaking, for three reasons. First, because in a marriage where a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is given there should be likeness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> between bridegroom and bride, and this is lacking in the union of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the Divine; secondly, because there is required a distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not personally distinct from the Word; thirdly, because a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is given when the bride is first taken to the dwelling of the bridegroom and thus would seem to belong to the bride, who from being not united becomes united; whereas the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which was assumed into the unity of Person by the Word, never was otherwise than perfectly united. Wherefore in the opinion of others we should say that the notion of <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is either altogether unbecoming to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or not so properly as to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; but that the things which we call <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> befit Him in the highest degree.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This conformity must be understood to refer to the thing which is a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> and not to the notion of a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> being in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: for it is not requisite that the thing in which we are conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be in the same way in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and in us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not properly said to be a bride in its union with the Word, since the distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, which is requisite between bridegroom and bride, is not observed therein. That <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is sometimes described as being espoused in reference to its union with the Word is because it has a certain act of the bride, in that it is united to the Bridegroom inseparably, and in this union is subject to the Word and ruled by the Word, as the bride by the bridegroom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is sometimes spoken of as the Bride, this is not because He is the Bride in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but in so far as He personifies His spouse, namely the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who is united to Him spiritually. Hence nothing hinders Him, in this way of speaking, from being said to have the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a>, not that He Himself is dowered, but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The term <em>Church</em> is taken in two senses. For sometimes it denotes the body only, which is united to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as its Head. In this way alone has the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the character of spouse: and in this way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but is the Head from which all the members receive. In another sense the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> denotes the head and members united together; and thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, inasmuch as He fulfills an office distinct from all others, by pouring forth life into the other members: although He is not very properly called a member, since a member implies a certain restriction, whereas in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not restricted but is absolutely entire [Cf. III, 8, 1, so that He is the entire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, nor is He together with others anything greater than He is by Himself. Speaking of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in this sense, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> denotes not only the bride, but the bridegroom and bride, in so far as one thing results from their <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> union. Consequently although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be called a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in a certain sense, He can by no means be called a member of the bride; and therefore the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is not becoming to Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> There is here a fallacy of "accident"; for these things are not befitting to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> if we consider them under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the angels receive the dowries?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> receive <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse8">Canticle of Canticles 6:8</a>, "One is my dove," says: "One is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the bride, wherefore it is fitting for the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to have the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse36">Luke 12:36</a>, "And you yourselves like to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who wait for their lord, when he shall return from the wedding," says: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> went to the wedding when after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> the new Man espoused to Himself the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> host." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> hosts are the spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and consequently it is fitting that they should have the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage consists in a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> union. Now the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> union between the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is no less than between beatified men and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> of which we treat now are assigned by reason of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage, it would seem that they are becoming to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage demands a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> bridegroom and a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> bride. Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> more conformed than men to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as the supreme spirit. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage is more possible between the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> than between men and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a greater conformity is required between the head and members than between bridegroom and bride. Now the conformity between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> suffices for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be called the Head of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore for the same reason it suffices for Him to be called their bridegroom.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> at the beginning of the prologue to his commentary on the Canticles, distinguishes four <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, namely "the bridegroom with the bride, the young <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maidens</a>, and the companions of the bridegroom": and he says that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are the companions of the bridegroom." Since then the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is due only to the bride, it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> are not becoming to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> espoused the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: wherefore this is foreshadowed in the words (<a href="../bible/exo004.htm#verse25">Exodus 4:25</a>), "A bloody spouse thou art to me." Now by His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not otherwise united to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> than before. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if we consider the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as spouse. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> are not becoming to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, whatever pertains to the endowments of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is befitting to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as it is to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But considered under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> they are not as becoming to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because the character of bride is not so properly becoming to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For there is required a conformity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> between bridegroom and bride, to wit that they should be of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are in conformity with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in this way, since He took <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and by so doing became conformed to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. on the other hand, He is not conformed to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in unity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, neither as to His Divine nor as to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently the notion of <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is not so properly becoming to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Since, however, in metaphorical expressions, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a likeness in every respect, we must not argue that one thing is not to be said of another metaphorically on account of some lack of likeness; and consequently the argument we have adduced does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> are simply unbecoming to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but only that they are not so properly befitting to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, on account of the aforesaid lack of likeness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are included in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they are not members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> according to conformity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, if we consider the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as bride: and thus it is not properly fitting for them to have the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Espousal is taken there in a broad sense, for union without conformity of specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and in this sense nothing prevents our saying that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> taking these in a broad sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage although there is no other than a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> union, those whose union answers to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a perfect marriage should agree in specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence espousal does not properly befit the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The conformity between the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not such as suffices for the notion of a perfect marriage, since so far are they from agreeing in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> that there is still an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> distance between them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Not even is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> properly called the Head of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, if we consider the head as requiring conformity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the members. We must observe, however, that although the head and the other members are parts of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, if we consider each one by itself, it is not of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as another member, for a hand is another specific part from the head. Hence, speaking of the members in themselves, the only conformity required among them is one of proportion, so that one receive from another, and one serve another. Consequently the conformity between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> suffices for the notion of head rather than for that of bridegroom.

Now love regards the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and vision the understanding. Therefore there should be something corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, since fruition regards not the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the beatific <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> are said to correspond to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the way, which united us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and these are <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is the object. Now love corresponds to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and vision to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore there should be something corresponding to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, since fruition corresponds rather to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by love and vision only, since "we are said to enjoy those things which we love for their own sake," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 4). Therefore fruition should not be reckoned a distinct <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> from love.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, comprehension is required for the perfection of beatitude: "So run that you may comprehend" (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>). Therefore we should reckon a fourth <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (De Simil. xlviii) that the following pertain to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> beatitude: "wisdom, friendship, concord, power, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, security, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>": and consequently the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> are reckoned unsuitably.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxii) that "in that beatitude <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be seen unendingly, loved without wearying, praised untiringly." Therefore praise should be added to the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> reckons five things pertaining to beatitude (De Consol. iii) and these are: Sufficiency which <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> offers, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which pleasure offers, celebrity which fame offers, security which power offers, reverence which dignity offers. Consequently it seems that these should be reckoned as <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> rather than the aforesaid.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All agree in reckoning three <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in different ways however. For some say that the three <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are vision, love, and fruition. others reckon them to be vision, comprehension, and fruition; others, vision, delight, and comprehension. However, all these reckonings come to the same, and their number is assigned in the same way. For it has been said (2) that a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> is something inherent to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and directing it to the operation in which beatitude consists. Now two things are requisite in this operation: its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> which is vision, and its perfection which is delight: since beatitude must needs be a perfect operation. Again, a vision is delightful in two ways: first, on the part of the object, by reason of the thing seen being delightful; secondly, on the part of the vision, by reason of the seeing itself being delightful, even as we delight in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, although the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things themselves delight us not. And since this operation wherein ultimate beatitude consists must needs be most perfect, this vision must needs be delightful in both ways. Now in order that this vision be delightful on the part of the vision, it needs to be made connatural to the seer by means of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; while for it to be delightful on the part of the visible object, two things are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, namely that the visible object be suitable, and that it be united to the seer. Accordingly for the vision to be delightful on its own part a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is required to elicit the vision, and thus we have one <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>, which all call vision. But on the part of the visible object two things are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. First, suitableness, which regards the affections--and in this respect some reckon love as a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>, others fruition (in so far as fruition regards the affective part) since what we love most we deem most suitable. Secondly, union is required on the part of the visible object, and thus some reckon comprehension, which is nothing else than to have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> present and to hold Him within ourself [Cf. I-II, 4, 3]; while others reckon fruition, not of hope, which is ours while on the way, but of possession [Literally "of the reality: non spei . . . sed rei"] which is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p>Thus the three <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> correspond to the three theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, namely vision to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, comprehension (or fruition in one sense) to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, and fruition (or delight according to another reckoning to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>). For perfect fruition such as will be had in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> includes delight and comprehension, for which reason some take it for the one, and some for the other.

<p>Others, however, ascribe these three <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> to the three powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, namely vision to the rational, delight to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, and fruition to the irascible, seeing that this fruition is acquired by a victory. But this is not said properly, because the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers are not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> but in the sensitive part, whereas the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are assigned to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">Memory</a> and understanding have but one act: either because understanding is itself an act of <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, or--if understanding denote a power--because <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> does not proceed to act save through the medium of the understanding, since it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> to retain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Consequently there is only one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, corresponding to <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> and understanding: wherefore only one <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>, namely vision, corresponds to both.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fruition corresponds to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, in so far as it includes comprehension which will take the place of <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>: since we <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> for that which we have not yet; wherefore <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> chafes somewhat on account of the distance of the beloved: for which reason it will not remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> [Cf. II-II, 18, 2] but will be succeeded by comprehension.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Fruition as including comprehension is distinct from vision and love, but otherwise than love from vision. For love and vision denote different <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, the one belonging to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the other to the affective faculty. But comprehension, or fruition as denoting comprehension, does not signify a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> distinct from those two, but the removal of the obstacles which made it impossible for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by actual vision. This is brought about by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> freeing the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from all defects; for instance by making it capable of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> without phantasms, of complete control over the body, and so forth, thus removing the obstacles which result in our being <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4</strong> is clear from what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Properly speaking, the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> are the immediate principles of the operation in which perfect beatitude consists and whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The things mentioned by <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> do not answer to this description; but they are such as in any way accompany or follow beatitude, not only in relation to the Bridegroom, to Whom "wisdom" alone of the things mentioned by him refers, but also in relation to others. They may be either one's equals, to whom "friendship" refers as regards the union of affections, and "concord" as regards consent in actions, or one's inferiors, to whom "power" refers, so far as inferior things are ordered by superior, and "<a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>" as regards that which inferiors offer to their superiors. Or again (they may accompany or follow beatitude) in relation to oneself: to this "security" refers as regards the removal of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>" as regards the attainment of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Praise, which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> mentions as the third of those things which will obtain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, is not a disposition to beatitude but rather a sequel to beatitude: because from the very fact of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherein beatitude consists, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> breaks forth into praise. Hence praise has not the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The five things aforesaid mentioned by <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> are certain <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of beatitude, but not dispositions to beatitude or to its act, because beatitude by reason of its perfection has of itself alone and undividedly all that men seek in various things, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. i, 7; x, 7,8). Accordingly <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> shows that these five things obtain in perfect beatitude, because they are what men seek in temporal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For they pertain either, as "security," to immunity from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or to the attainment either of the suitable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>," or of the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as "sufficiency," or to the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as "celebrity," inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to others, or as "reverence," as indicating that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> thereof, for reverence is the showing of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which bears witness to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence it is evident that these five should not be called <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a>, but <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of beatitude.
