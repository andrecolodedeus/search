<h1>Question 95. Things pertaining to the first man's will--namely, grace and righteousness</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1095.htm#article1"> Was the first man created in grace?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1095.htm#article2"> In the state of innocence, did he have passions of the soul?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1095.htm#article3"> Did he have all virtues?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1095.htm#article4"> Would what he did have been as meritorious as now?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the first man was created in grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, distinguishing between <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse45">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>): "The first <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was made into a living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; the last <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> into a quickening spirit." But the spirit is quickened by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone was made in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. Vet. et Nov. Test., qu. 123) [Work of an anonymous author, among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>] that "<a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> did not possess the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." But whoever possesses <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Correp. et Grat. x) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so ordered the life of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men, as to show first what they could do by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, then what they could do by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and by the discernment of righteousness." <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> thus first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the state of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> only; and afterwards bestowed <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on them.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. ii, D, xxiv): "When <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> he was given sufficient help to stand, but not sufficient to advance." But whoever has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can advance by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Therefore the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the reception of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> requires the consent of the recipient, since thereby a kind of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage takes place between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But consent presupposes <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did not receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the first moment of his creation.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is more distant from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which is but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> consummaed. But in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore much more did <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> precede <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Man and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> are both ordained to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xii, 9): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at the same time fashioned their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and endowed them with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but that it was bestowed on him subsequently before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and many authorities of the Saints declare that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> possessed <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the state of innocence.

<p>But the very rectitude of the primitive state, wherewith <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was endowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seems to require that, as others say, he was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse30">Ecclesiastes 7:30</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> right." For this rectitude consisted in his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> being subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the lower powers to reason, and the body to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and the first subjection was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of both the second and the third; since while reason was subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the lower powers remained subject to reason, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says [Cf. De Civ. Dei xiii, 13; De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i, 16. Now it is clear that such a subjection of the body to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of the lower powers to reason, was not from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; otherwise it would have remained after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; since even in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> remained after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declared (Div. Nom. iv). Hence it is clear that also the primitive subjection by virtue of which reason was subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was not a merely <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> endowment of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for it is not possible that the effect should be of greater efficiency than the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiii, 13) that, "as soon as they disobeyed the Divine command, and forfeited <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, they were ashamed of their nakedness, for they felt the impulse of disobedience in the flesh, as though it were a punishment corresponding to their own disobedience." Hence if the loss of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> dissolved the obedience of the flesh to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, we may gather that the inferior powers were subjected to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> therein.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> in these words means to show that there is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> body, if there is an animal body, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life of the body began in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is "the firstborn of the dead," as the body's animal life began in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. From the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> words, therefore, we cannot gather that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but that he had not <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life as regards the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the same passage, it is not disputed that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, like other just <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, was in some degree gifted with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; but "he did not possess the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as the faithful possess Him now," who are admitted to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> directly after death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This passage from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> does not assert that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or men were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> before they possessed <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shows first what their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> could do before being confirmed in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and what they acquired afterwards by being so confirmed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> here speaks according to the opinion of those who held that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but only in a state of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. We may also say that, though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, yet it was not by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> wherein he was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> that he could advance by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, but by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which was added.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As the motion of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not continuous there is nothing against the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> having consented to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> even in the first moment of his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> We <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by an act of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but we do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by an act of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; hence the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether passions existed in the soul of the first man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> "the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusteth</a> against the spirit" (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse7">Galatians 5:7</a>). But this did not happen in the state of innocence. Therefore in the state of innocence there were no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was nobler than his body. But his body was impassible. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> were in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are restrained by the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were perfect. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> were entirely excluded from him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10) that "in our first parents there was undisturbed love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are in the sensual <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, the object of which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Wherefore some <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are directed to what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as love and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; others to what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as fear and sorrow. And since in the primitive state, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was neither present nor imminent, nor was any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> wanting which a good-will could desire to have then, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10), therefore <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had no passion with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as its object; such as fear, sorrow, and the like; neither had he <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not possessed, but to be possessed then, as burning <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. But those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which regard present <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and love; or which regard future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be had at the proper time, as desire and hope that casteth not down, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the state of innocence; otherwise, however, than as they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in ourselves. For our sensual <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, wherein the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> reside, is not entirely subject to reason; hence at times our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> forestall and hinder reason's judgment; at other times they follow reason's judgment, accordingly as the sensual <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> obeys reason to some extent. But in the state of innocence the inferior <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> was wholly subject to reason: so that in that state the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> only as consequent upon the judgment of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The flesh lusts against the spirit by the rebellion of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> against reason; which could not occur in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was impassible in the state of innocence as regards the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which alter the disposition of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as will be explained later on (97, 2); likewise the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was impassible as regards the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which impede the free use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Perfection of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not wholly take away the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but regulates them; for the temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires as he ought to desire, and what he ought to desire, as stated in Ethic. iii, 11.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Adam had all the virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had not all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are directed to curb <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: thus immoderate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is restrained by <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and immoderate fear by <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. But in the state of innocence no immoderation <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore neither did these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> then <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are concerned with the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which have <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as their object; as meekness with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> with fear. But these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the state of innocence, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore neither did those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> then.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, penance is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that regards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed. Mercy, too, is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> concerned with unhappiness. But in the state of innocence neither <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> nor unhappiness <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. Therefore neither did those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, perseverance is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> possessed it not; as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by his subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore he possessed not every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But it did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the state of innocence; for it implies an obscurity of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which seems to be incompatible with the perfection of the primitive state.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (Serm. contra Judaeos): "The prince of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> overcame <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> who was made from the slime of the earth to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, adorned with modesty, restrained by <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, refulgent with brightness."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in a certain sense possessed all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and this can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from what precedes. For it was shown above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) that such was the rectitude of the primitive state, that reason was subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the lower powers to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are nothing but those perfections whereby reason is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the inferior powers regulated according to the dictate of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as will be explained in the Treatise on the Virtues (I-II, 63, 2). Wherefore the rectitude of the primitive state required that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should in a sense possess every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>It must, however, be noted that some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> do not involve imperfection, such as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> did <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the primitive state absolutely, both in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and in act. But other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are of such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to imply imperfection either in their act, or on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. If such imperfection be consistent with the perfection of the primitive state, such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in that state; as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is of things not seen, and hope which is of things not yet possessed. For the perfection of that state did not extend to the vision of the Divine Essence, and the possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the enjoyment of final beatitude. Hence <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope could <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the primitive state, both as to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and as to act. But any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which implies imperfection incompatible with the perfection of the primitive state, could <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in that state as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but not as to the act; for instance, penance, which is sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed; and mercy, which is sorrow for others' unhappiness; because sorrow, guilt, and unhappiness are incompatible with the perfection of the primitive state. Wherefore such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> as <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but not as to their acts; for he was so disposed that he would repent, if there had been a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to repent for; and had he seen unhappiness in his neighbor, he would have done his best to remedy it. This is in accordance with what the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says, "Shame, which regards what is ill done, may be found in a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but only conditionally; as being so disposed that he would be ashamed if he did wrong" (Ethic. iv, 9).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to subdue superabundant passion, in so far as they are in a subject which happens to have superabundant <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and yet those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are 'per se' competent to moderate the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Passions which have <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for their object were incompatible with the perfection of the primitive state, if that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be in the one affected by the passion; such as fear and sorrow. But <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which relate to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in another are not incompatible with the perfection of the primitive state; for in that state <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, as he could love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which relate to such <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> could <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the primitive state, in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and in act. <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">Virtues</a>, however, relating to <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which regard <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the same subject, if relating to such <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> only, could not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the primitive state in act, but only in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as we have said above of penance and of mercy. But other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> there are which have relation not to such <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> only, but to others; such as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which relates not only to sorrow, but also to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which relates not only to fear, but also to daring and hope. Thus the act of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> could <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the primitive state, so far as it moderates pleasure; and in like manner, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, as moderating daring and hope, but not as moderating sorrow and fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> appears from what has been said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Perseverance may be taken in two ways: in one sense as a particular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, signifying a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby a man makes a choice of persevering in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; in that sense <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> possessed perseverance. In another sense it is taken as a circumstance of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; signifying a certain uninterrupted continuation of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; in which sense <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> did not possess perseverance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> appears from what has been said above.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the actions of the first man were less meritorious than ours are?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the actions of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were less <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> than ours are. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given to us through the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who succors most those who are most in need. Now we are more in need of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the state of innocence. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is more copiously poured out upon us; and since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the source of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, our actions are more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, struggle and difficulty are required for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse5">2 Timothy 2:5</a>): "He . . . is not crowned except he strive lawfully" and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 3): "The object of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the difficult and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But there is more strife and difficulty now. Therefore there is greater efficacy for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. ii., D, xxiv) that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not have <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> in resisting <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; whereas he does <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> now, when he resists." Therefore our actions are more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> than in the primitive state.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> if such were the case, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would be better off after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Merit as regards degree may be gauged in two ways.

<p>First, in its root, which is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Merit thus measured corresponds in degree to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, which consists in the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the greater the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whence our actions proceed, the more perfectly shall we enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Secondly, the degree of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is measured by the degree of the action itself. This degree is of two kinds, absolute and proportional. The <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who put two mites into the treasury performed a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> of absolutely less degree than the others who put great sums therein. But in proportionate degree the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> gave more, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said; because she gave more in proportion to her means. In each of these cases the degree of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward, which consists in rejoicing for <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>We conclude therefore that in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> works were more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> than after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was committed, if we consider the degree of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> on the part of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which would have been more copious as meeting with no obstacle in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and in like manner, if we consider the absolute degree of the work done; because, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have had greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, he would have performed greater works. But if we consider the proportionate degree, a greater reason for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, on account of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> weakness; because a small <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is more beyond the capacity of one who works with difficulty than a great <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is beyond one who performs it easily.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> After <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> requires <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for more things than before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but he does not need <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> more; forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> even before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> required <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to obtain <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, which is the chief reason for the need of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> required <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> also for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and for the support of his weakness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Difficulty and struggle belong to the degree of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> according to the proportionate degree of the work done, as above explained. It is also a sign of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> promptitude striving after what is difficult to itself: and the promptitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the intensity of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Yet it may happen that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> performs an easy <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> with as prompt a will as another performs an arduous <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>; because he is ready to do even what may be difficult to him. But the actual difficulty, by its penal character, enables the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> to satisfy for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not have gained <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in resisting <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, according to the opinion of those who say that he did not possess <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; even as now there is no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to those who have not <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But in this point there is a difference, inasmuch as in the primitive state there was no interior impulse to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as in our present state. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was more able then than now to resist <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> even without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.
