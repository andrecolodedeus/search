<h1>Question 96. Superstition in observances</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it be unlawful to practice the observances of the magic art?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not unlawful to practice the observances of the magic art. A thing is said to be unlawful in two ways. First, by reason of the genus of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>: secondly, through being directed to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end, as when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> gives an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for the sake of vainglory. Now the observances of the magic art are not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as to the genus of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, for they consist in certain fasts and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; moreover, they are directed to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end, namely, the acquisition of science. Therefore it is not unlawful to practice these observances.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/dan001.htm#verse17">Daniel 1:17</a>) that "to the children" who abstained, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and understanding in every book, and wisdom." Now the observances of the magic art consist in certain fasts and abstinences. Therefore it seems that this art achieves its results through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and consequently it is not unlawful to practice it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, seemingly, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the reason why it is wrong to inquire of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> concerning the future is because they have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it, this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> being proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> scientific <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>: because <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are about things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and invariable, and such things are subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and much more to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who are of keener <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says [Gen. ad lit. ii, 17; De Divin. Daemon. 3,4. Therefore it seems to be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to practice the magic art, even though it achieve its result through the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 18:10-11</a>): "Neither let there be found among you . . . anyone . . . that seeketh the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the dead": which search relies on the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' help. Now through the observances of the magic art, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is sought "by means of certain signs agreed upon by compact with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, De Doctr. Christ. ii, 20; see above (92, 2). Therefore it is unlawful to practice the notary art.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The magic art is both unlawful and futile. It is unlawful, because the means it employs for acquiring <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> have not in themselves the power to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> science, consisting as they do in gazing certain shapes, and muttering certain strange words, and so forth. Wherefore this art does not make use of these things as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, but as signs; not however as signs instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as are the sacramental signs. It follows, therefore, that they are empty signs, and consequently a kind of "agreement or covenant made with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> for the purpose of consultation and of compact by tokens" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, De Doctr. Christ. ii, 20; see above (92, 2). Wherefore the magic art is to be absolutely repudiated and avoided by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, even as other arts of vain and noxious superstition, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 23). This art is also useless for the acquisition of science. For since it is not intended by means of this art to acquire science in a manner connatural to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, namely, by discovery and instruction, the consequence is that this effect is expected either from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Now it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that some have received wisdom and science infused into them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as related of Solomon (<a href="../bible/1ki003.htm">1 Kings 3</a> and <a href="../bible/2ch001.htm">2 Chronicles 1</a>). Moreover, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse15">Luke 21:15</a>): "I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to resist and gainsay." However, this <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is not granted to all, or in connection with any particular observance, but according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>, "To one indeed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is given the word of wisdom, to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to the same Spirit," and afterwards it is said (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 12:11</a>): "All these things one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to everyone according as He will." On the other hand it does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to enlighten the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as stated in I, 109, 3. Now the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and wisdom is effected by the enlightening of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, wherefore never did anyone acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by means of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x, 9): "Porphyry confesses that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in no way cleansed by theurgic inventions," i.e. the operations "of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, so as to be fitted to see its <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and discern what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>," such as are all scientific conclusions. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> may, however, be able by speaking to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to express in words certain teachings of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, but this is not what is sought by means of magic.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing to acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but it is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to acquire it by undue means, and it is to this end that the magic art tends.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The abstinence of these children was not in accordance with a vain observance of the notary art, but according to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>, for they refused to be defiled by the meat of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Hence as a reward for their obedience they received <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse100">Psalm 118:100</a>, "I have had understanding above the ancients, because I have sought Thy commandments."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To seek <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not only because they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the future, but also on account of the fellowship entered into with them, which also applies to the case in point.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether observances directed to the alteration of bodies, as for the purpose of acquiring health or the like, are unlawful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that observances directed to the alteration of bodies, as for the purpose of acquiring health, or the like, are lawful. It is lawful to make use of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forces of bodies in order to produce their proper effects. Now in the physical order things have certain occult forces, the reason of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is unable to assign; for instance that the magnet attracts iron, and many like instances, all of which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> enumerates (De Civ. Dei xxi, 5,7). Therefore it would seem lawful to employ such like forces for the alteration of bodies.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, artificial bodies are subject to the heavenly bodies, just as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies are. Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies acquire certain occult forces resulting from their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> through the influence of the heavenly bodies. Therefore artificial bodies, e.g. images, also acquire from the heavenly bodies a certain occult force for the production of certain effects. Therefore it is not unlawful to make use of them and of such like things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> too are able to alter bodies in many ways, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Trin. iii, 8,9). But their power is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it is lawful to make use of their power for the purpose of producing these alterations.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 20) that "to superstition belong the experiments of magic arts, amulets and nostrums condemned by the medical faculty, consisting either of incantations or of certain cyphers which they call characters, or of any kind of thing worn or fastened on."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In things done for the purpose of producing some bodily effect we must consider whether they seem able to produce that effect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>: for if so it will not be unlawful to do so, since it is lawful to employ <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in order to produce their proper effects. But, if they seem unable to produce those effects <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, it follows that they are employed for the purpose of producing those effects, not as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> but only as signs, so that they come under the head of "compact by tokens entered into with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, De Doctr. Christ.; see above (92, 2). Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 6): "The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are allured by means of creatures, which were made, not by them, but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They are enticed by various objects differing according to the various things in which they delight, not as animals by meat, but as spirits by signs, such as are to each one's liking, by means of various kinds of stones, herbs, trees, animals, songs and rites."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is nothing <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> or unlawful in employing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things simply for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> certain effects such as they are thought to have the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of producing. But if in addition there be employed certain characters, words, or any other vain observances which clearly have no efficacy by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it will be <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and unlawful.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forces of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies result from their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms which they acquire through the influence of heavenly bodies; wherefore through this same influence they acquire certain active forces. On the other hand the forms of artificial bodies result from the conception of the craftsman; and since they are nothing else but composition, order and shape, as stated in Phys. i, 5, they cannot have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> active force. Consequently, no force accrues to them from the influence of heavenly bodies, in so far as they are artificial, but only in respect of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, what Porphyry held, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei x, 11), that "by herbs, stones, animals, certain particular sounds, words, shapes and devices, or again by certain movements of the stars observed in the course of the heavens it is possible for men to fashion on earth forces capable of carrying into effect the various dispositions of the stars," as though the results of the magic arts were to be ascribed to the power of the heavenly bodies. On fact as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> adds (De Civ. Dei x, 11), "all these things are to be ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who delude the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are subject to them."

<p>Wherefore those images called astronomical also derive their efficacy from the actions of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>: a sign of this is that it is requisite to inscribe certain characters on them which do not conduce to any effect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, since shape is not a principle of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> action. Yet astronomical images differ from necromantic images in this, that the latter include certain explicit invocations and trickery, wherefore they come under the head of explicit agreements made with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>: whereas in the other images there are tacit agreements by means of tokens in certain shapes or characters.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It belongs to the domain of the divine majesty, to Whom the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are subject, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should employ them to whatever purpose He will. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has not been entrusted with power over the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, to employ them to whatsoever purpose he will; on the contrary, it is appointed that he should wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Hence in no way is it lawful for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to make use of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' help by compacts either tacit or express.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether observances directed to the purpose of fortune-telling are unlawful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that observances directed to the purpose of fortune-telling are not unlawful. Sickness is one of the misfortunes that occur to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now sickness in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is preceded by certain symptoms, which the physician observes. Therefore it seems not unlawful to observe such like signs.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is unreasonable to deny that which nearly everybody experiences. Now nearly everyone experiences that certain times, or places, hearing of certain words meetings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> or animals, uncanny or ungainly actions, are presages of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to come. Therefore it seems not unlawful to observe these things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions and occurrences are disposed by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> in a certain order: and this order seems to require that precedent events should be signs of subsequent occurrences: wherefore, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>), the things that happened to the fathers of old are signs of those that take place in our time. Now it is not unlawful to observe the order that proceeds from <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>. Therefore it is seemingly not unlawful to observe these presages.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 20) that "a thousand vain observances are comprised under the head of compacts entered into with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>: for instance, the twitching of a limb; a stone, a dog, or a boy coming between friends walking together; kicking the door-post when anyone passes in front of one's house; to go back to bed if you happen to sneeze while putting on your shoes; to return home if you trip when going forth; when the rats have gnawed a hole in your clothes, to fear superstitiously a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> rather than to regret the actual damage."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Men attend to all these observances, not as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> but as signs of future events, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Nor do they observe them as signs given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since these signs are brought forward, not on divine authority, but rather by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> vanity with the cooperation of the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who strive to entangle men's minds with such like trifles. Accordingly it is evident that all these observances are <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and unlawful: they are apparently remains of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, which authorized the observance of auguries, of lucky and unlucky days which is allied to <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by the stars, in respect of which one day differentiated from another: except that these observances are devoid of reason and art, wherefore they are yet more vain and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of sickness are seated in us, and they produce certain signs of sickness to come, which physicians lawfully observe. Wherefore it is not unlawful to consider a presage of future events as proceeding from its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; as when a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> a flogging when he sees his master's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Possibly the same might be said if one were to fear for child lest it take harm from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> eye, of which we have spoken in I, 117, 3, ad 2. But this does not apply to this kind of observances.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That men have at first experienced a certain degree of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in these observances is due to chance. But afterwards when a man begins to entangle his mind with observances of this kind, many things occur in connection with them through the trickery of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, "so that men, through being entangled in these observances, become yet more curious, and more and more embroiled in the manifold snares of a pernicious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 23).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Among the Jewish people of whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to be born, not only words but also <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> were <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Contra Faust. iv, 2; xxii, 24). Wherefore it is lawful to apply those <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> to our instruction, as signs given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Not all things, however, that occur through <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> are ordered so as to be signs of the future. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is unlawful to wear divine words at the neck?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not unlawful to wear divine words at the neck. Divine words are no less efficacious when written than when uttered. But it is lawful to utter sacred words for the purpose of producing certain effects; (for instance, in order to heal the sick), such as the "Our Father" or the "Hail Mary," or in any way whatever to call on the Lord's name, according to <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse17">Mark 16:17-18</a>, "In My name they shall cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a>, they shall speak with new tongues, they shall take up serpents." Therefore it seems to be lawful to wear sacred words at one's neck, as a remedy for sickness or for any kind of distress.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sacred words are no less efficacious on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body than on the bodies of serpents and other animals. Now certain incantations are efficacious in checking serpents, or in healing certain other animals: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/psa057.htm#verse5">Psalm 57:5</a>): "Their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is according to the likeness of a serpent, like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ears, which will not hear the voice of the charmers, nor of the wizard that charmeth wisely." Therefore it is lawful to wear sacred words as a remedy for men.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word is no less <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> than the relics of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Lib. L. Hom. xxvi) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word is of no less account than the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Now it is lawful for one to wear the relics of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> at one's neck, or to carry them about one in any way for the purpose of self-protection. Therefore it is equally lawful to have recourse to the words of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, whether uttered or written, for one's protection.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xliii in Matth.) [Cf. the Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum, among <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom's</a> works, and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to him]: "Some wear round their necks a passage in writing from the Gospel. Yet is not the Gospel read in church and heard by all every day? How then, if it does a man no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to have the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> in his ears, will he find <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by wearing them round his neck? Moreover, where is the power of the Gospel? In the shapes of the letters or in the understanding of the sense? If in the shapes, you do well to wear them round your neck; if in the understanding, you will then do better to bear them in your heart than to wear them round your neck."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In every incantation or wearing of written words, two points seem to demand caution. The first is the thing said or written, because if it is connected with invocation of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> it is clearly <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and unlawful. On like manner it seems that one should beware lest it contain strange words, for fear that they conceal something unlawful. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Cf. the Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum, among <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom's</a> works, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to him] that "many now after the example of the Pharisees who enlarged their fringes, invent and write Hebrew names of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and fasten them to their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Such things seem fearsome to those who do not understand them." Again, one should take care lest it contain anything <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because in that case also the effect could not be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who does not bear witness to a falsehood.

<p>In the second place, one should beware lest besides the sacred words it contain something vain, for instance certain written characters, except the sign of the Cross; or if hope be placed in the manner of writing or fastening, or in any like vanity, having no connection with reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because this would be pronounced <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>: otherwise, however, it is lawful. Hence it is written in the Decretals (XXVI, qu. v, cap. Non liceat Christianis): "In blending together medicinal herbs, it is not lawful to make use of observances or incantations, other than the divine symbol, or the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, so as to give <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to none but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> of all."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is indeed lawful to pronounce divine words, or to invoke the divine name, if one do so with a mind to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, from Whom the result is expected: but it is unlawful if it be done in connection with any vain observance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even in the case of incantations of serpents or any animals whatever, if the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> attend exclusively to the sacred words and to the divine power, it will not be unlawful. Such like incantations, however, often include unlawful observances, and rely on the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> for their result, especially in the case of serpents, because the serpent was the first instrument employed by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in order to deceive <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the passage quoted says: "Note that <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> does not commend everything whence it draws its comparisons, as in the case of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judge who scarcely heard the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> request."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The same applies to the wearing of relics, for if they be worn out of confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> whose relics they are, it will not be unlawful. But if account were taken in this matter of some vain circumstance (for instance that the casket be three-cornered, or the like, having no bearing on the reverence due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>), it would be <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and unlawful.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> is speaking the case in which more attention is paid the written characters than to the understanding of the words.
