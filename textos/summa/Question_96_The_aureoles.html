<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the aureole is the same as the essential reward which is called the aurea?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the aureole is not distinct from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward which is called the "aurea." For the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward is beatitude itself. Now according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Consol. iii), beatitude is "a state rendered perfect by the aggregate of all goods." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward includes every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> possessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; so that the aureole is included in the "aurea."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "more" and "less" do not change a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But those who keep the counsels and commandments receive a greater reward than those who keep the commandments only, nor seemingly does their reward differ, except in one reward being greater than another. Since then the aureole denotes the reward due to works of perfection it would seem that it does not signify something distinct from the "aurea."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, reward corresponds to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Since then the "aurea" corresponds to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it would seem that there will be no reward in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> other than the "aurea."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, "All the blessed are taken into the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders" as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> declares (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.). Now as regards the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, "though some of them receive certain <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> in a higher degree, nothing is possessed by any of them exclusively, for all <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are in all of them, though not equally, because some are endowed more highly than others with <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> which, however, they all possess," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.). Therefore as regards the blessed, there will be no reward other than that which is common to all. Therefore the aureole is not a distinct reward from the "aurea."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a higher reward is due to higher <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. If, then, the "aurea" is due to works which are of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and the aureole to works of counsel, the aureole will be more perfect than the "aurea," and consequently should not be expressed by a diminutive ["Aureola," i.e. a little "aurea"]. Therefore it would seem that the aureole is not a distinct reward from the "aurea."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Ven. Bede</a>, De Tabernaculis i, 6 on <a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse24">Exodus 25:24-25</a>, "Thou shalt make . . . another little golden crown [coronam aureolam]," says: "This crown denotes the new <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> which the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> alone sing in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>." Wherefore apparently the aureole is a crown awarded, not to all, but especially to some: whereas the aurea is awarded to all the blessed. Therefore the aureole is distinct from the "aurea."

<p>Further, a crown is due to the fight which is followed by victory: "He . . . is not crowned except he strive lawfully" (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse5">2 Timothy 2:5</a>). Hence where there is a special kind of conflict, there should be a special crown. Now in certain works there is a special kind of conflict. Therefore they deserve a special kind of crown, which we call an aureole.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant comes down from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> triumphant: "I saw the Holy City," etc. (<a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse2">Apocalypse 21:2</a>). Now in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant special rewards are given to those who perform special <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, for instance a crown to the conqueror, a prize to the runner. Therefore the same should obtain in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> triumphant.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, which is his beatitude, consists in the perfect union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as it enjoys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perfectly as seen and loved perfectly. Now this reward is called a "crown" or "aurea" metaphorically, both with reference to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> which is gained by a kind of conflict--since "the life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> upon earth is a warfare" (<a href="../bible/job007.htm#verse1">Job 7:1</a>)--and with reference to the reward whereby in a way <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made a participator of the Godhead, and consequently endowed with regal power: "Thou hast made us to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a kingdom," etc. (<a href="../bible/rev005.htm#verse10">Apocalypse 5:10</a>); for a crown is the proper sign of regal power.

<p>In like manner the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward which is added to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> has the character of a crown. For a crown signifies some kind of perfection, on account of its circular shape, so that for this very reason it is becoming to the perfection of the blessed. Since, however, nothing can be added to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, but what is less than it, the additional reward is called an "aureole." Now something may be added in two ways to this <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward which we call the "aurea." First, in consequence of a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> attaching to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the one rewarded: thus the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body is added to the beatitude of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, wherefore this same <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body is sometimes called an "aureole." Thus a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> on <a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse25">Exodus 25:25</a>, "Thou . . . shalt make another little golden crown," says that "finally the aureole is added, when it is stated in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that a higher degree of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is in store for us when our bodies are resumed." But it is not in this sense that we speak of an aureole now. Secondly, in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act. Now this has the character of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> on two counts, whence also it has the character of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. First, to wit, from its root which is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since it is referred to the last end, and thus there is due to it the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, namely the attainment of the end, and this is the "aurea." Secondly, from the very genus of the act which derives a certain praiseworthiness from its due circumstances, from the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> eliciting it and from its proximate end, and thus is due to it a kind of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward which we call an "aureole": and it is in this sense that we regard the aureole now. Accordingly it must be said that an "aureole" denotes something added to the "aurea," a kind of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, to wit, in the works one has done, in that they have the character of a signal victory: for this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in being united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is called the "aurea." Some, however, affirm that the common reward, which is the "aurea," receives the name of "aureole," according as it is given to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, or <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>: even as money receives the name of debt through being due to some one, though the money and the debt are altogether the same. And that nevertheless this does not imply that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward is any greater when it is called an "aureole"; but that it corresponds to a more excellent act, more excellent not in intensity of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> but in the manner of meriting; so that although two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may have the Divine vision with equal clearness, it is called an "aureole" in one and not in the other in so far as it corresponds to higher <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> as regards the way of meriting. But this would seem contrary to the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> quoted above. For if "aurea" and "aureole" were the same, the "aureole" would not be described as added to the "aurea." Moreover, since reward corresponds to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, a more excellent reward must needs correspond to this more excellent way of meriting: and it is this excellence that we call an "aureole." Hence it follows that an "aureole" differs from the "aurea."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Beatitude includes all the goods <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfect life consisting in his perfect operation. Yet some things can be added, not as being <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for that perfect operation as though it were impossible without them, but as adding to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of beatitude. Hence they regard the well-being of beatitude and a certain fitness thereto. Even so civic <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is embellished by nobility and bodily beauty and so forth, and yet it is possible without them as stated in Ethic. i, 8: and thus is the aureole in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He who keeps the counsels and the commandments always <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> more than he who keeps the commandments only, if we gather the notion of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in works from the very genus of those works; but not always if we gauge the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> from its root, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: since sometimes a man keeps the commandments alone out of greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> than one who keeps both commandments and counsels. For the most part, however, the contrary happens, because the "<a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of love is in the performance of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxx in Evang.). Wherefore it is not the more excellent <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward that is called an aureole, but that which is added to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward without reference to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward of the possessor of an aureole being greater, or less than, or equal to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward of one who has no aureole.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is the first principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>: but our actions are the instruments, so to speak, whereby we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Now in order to obtain an effect there is requisite not only a due disposition in the first mover, but also a right disposition in the instrument. Hence something principal results in the effect with reference to the first mover, and something secondary with reference to the instrument. Wherefore in the reward also there is something on the part of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, namely the "aurea," and something on the part of the kind of work, namely the "aureole."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> All the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> their beatitude by the same kind of act namely by turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and consequently no particular reward is found in anyone which another has not in some way. But men <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> beatitude by different kinds of acts: and so the comparison fails.

<p>Nevertheless among men what one seems to have specially, all have in common in some way, in so far as each one, by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, deems another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> his own. Yet this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> whereby one shares another's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> cannot be called an aureole, because it is not given him as a reward for his victory, but regards more the victory of another: whereas a crown is awarded the victors themselves and not to those who rejoice with them in the victory.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> arising from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is more excellent than that which arises from the kind of action: just as the end to which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> directs us is more excellent than the things directed to that end, and with which our actions are concerned. Wherefore the reward corresponding to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by reason of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, however little it may be, is greater than any reward corresponding to an action by reason of its genus. Hence "aureole" is used as a diminutive in comparison with "aurea."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the aureole differs from the fruit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the aureole does not differ from the fruit. For different rewards are not due to the same <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Now the aureole and the hundredfold fruit correspond to the same <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse8">Matthew 13:8</a>, "Some a hundredfold." Therefore the aureole is the same as the fruit.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virgin xlv) that the "hundredfold fruit is due to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and also to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>." Therefore the fruit is a reward common to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. But the aureole also is due to them. Therefore the aureole is the same as the fruit.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there are only two rewards in beatitude, namely the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> which is added to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>. Now that which is added to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward is called an aureole, as evidenced by the statement (<a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse25">Exodus 25:25</a>) that the little crown [aureola] is added to the crown. But the fruit is not the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, for in that case it would be due to all the blessed. Therefore it is the same as the aureole.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Things which are not divided in the same way are not of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now fruit and aureole are not divided in the same way, since aureole is divided into the aureole of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>: whereas fruit is divided into the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>, of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. Therefore fruit and aureole are not the same.

<p>Further, if fruit and aureole were the same, the aureole would be due to whomsoever the fruit is due. But this is manifestly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, since a fruit is due to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a>, while an aureole is not. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Metaphorical expressions can be taken in various ways, according as we find resemblances to the various properties of the thing from which the comparison is taken. Now since fruit, properly speaking, is applied to material things born of the earth, we employ it variously in a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense, with reference to the various conditions that obtain in material fruits. For the material fruit has sweetness whereby it refreshes so far as it is used by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: again it is the last thing to which the operation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> attains: moreover it is that to which husbandry looks forward as the result of sowing or any other process. Accordingly fruit is taken in a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense sometimes for that which refreshes as being the last end: and according to this signification we are said to enjoy [frui] <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perfectly in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and imperfectly on the way. From this signification we have fruition which is a <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>: but we are not speaking of fruit in this sense now. Sometimes fruit signifies spiritually that which refreshes only, though it is not the last end; and thus the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are called fruits, inasmuch as "they refresh the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> with genuine sweetness," as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says [De Parad. xiii]. In this sense fruit is taken (<a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse22">Galatians 6:22</a>): "The fruit of the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>," etc. Nor again is this the sense in which we speak of fruit now; for we have treated of this already [Cf. I-II, 70, 1, ad 2].

<p>We may, however, take <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fruit in another sense, in likeness to material fruit, inasmuch as material fruit is a profit expected from the labor of husbandry: so that we call fruit that reward which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquires from his labor in this life: and thus every reward which by our labors we shall acquire for the future life is called a "fruit." In this sense fruit is taken (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse22">Romans 6:22</a>): "You have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life everlasting." Yet neither in this sense do we speak of fruit now, but we are treating of fruit as being the product of seed: for it is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> speaks of fruit (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse23">Matthew 13:23</a>), where He divides fruit into thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and hundredfold. Now fruit is the product of seed in so far as the seed power is capable of transforming the humors of the soil into its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and the more efficient this power, and the better prepared the soil, the more plentiful fruit will result. Now the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> seed which is sown in us is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>: wherefore the more a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is transformed into a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by withdrawing from carnal things, the greater is the fruit of the Word in him. Accordingly the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> differs from the aurea and the aureole, in that the "aurea" consists in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> one has in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the "aureole" in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> one has in the perfection of one's works, whereas the "fruit" consists in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> that the worker has in his own disposition as to his degree of spirituality to which he has attained through the seed of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God's Word</a>.

<p>Some, however, distinguish between aureole and fruit, by saying that the aureole is due to the fighter, according to <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse5">2 Timothy 2:5</a>, "He . . . shall not be crowned, except he strive lawfully"; whereas the fruit is due to the laborer, according to the saying of <a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse15">Wisdom 3:15</a>, "The fruit of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> labors is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>." Others again say that the "aurea" regards conversion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the "aureole" and the "fruit" regard things directed to the end; yet so that the fruit regards the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> rather, and the aureole the body. Since, however, labor and strife are in the same subject and about the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and since the body's reward depends on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a>, these explanations of the difference between fruit, aurea and aureole would only imply a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> difference: and this cannot be, since fruit is assigned to some to whom no aureole is assigned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is nothing incongruous if various rewards correspond to the same <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> according to the various things contained therein. Wherefore to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> corresponds the aurea in so far as <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is kept for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake at the command of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; the aureole, in so far as <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is a work of perfection having the character of a signal victory; and the fruit, in so far as by <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> acquires a certain spirituality by withdrawing from carnal things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fruit, according to the proper acceptation as we are speaking of it now, does not denote the reward common to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, by that which corresponds to the three degrees of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>. This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> which states that the hundredfold fruit corresponds to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> takes fruit in a broad sense, according as any reward is called a fruit, the hundredfold fruit thus denoting the reward due to any perfect works whatever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the aureole is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward added to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, nevertheless not every <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward is an aureole, but only that which is assigned to works of perfection, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is most conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the achievement of a perfect victory. Hence it is not unfitting that another <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward, which is called the fruit, be due sometimes to the withdrawal from a carnal life.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a fruit is due to the virtue of continence alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a fruit is not due to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> alone. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse41">1 Corinthians 15:41</a>, "One is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the sun," says that "the worth of those who have the hundredfold fruit is compared to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the sun; to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the moon those who have the sixtyfold fruit; and to the stars those who have the thirtyfold fruit." Now this difference of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, regards any difference whatever of beatitude. Therefore the various fruits should correspond to none but the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, fruits are so called from fruition. But fruition belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward which corresponds to all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fruit is due to labor: "The fruit of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> labors is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>" (<a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse15">Wisdom 3:15</a>). Now there is greater labor in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> than in <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> or <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>. Therefore fruit does not correspond to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is more difficult not to exceed the measure in food which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for life, than in sexual matters without which life can be sustained: and thus the labor of frugality is greater than that of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>. Therefore fruit corresponds to frugality rather than to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, fruit implies delight, and delight regards especially the end. Since then the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have the end for their object, namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, it would seem that to them especially the fruit should correspond.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> is the statement of the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse23">Matthew 13:23</a>, "The one a hundredfold," which assigns the fruits to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a>, and conjugal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, which are parts of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A fruit is a reward due to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in that he passes from the carnal to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life. Consequently a fruit corresponds especially to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which more than any other frees <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from subjection to the flesh. Now this is the effect of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, since it is by sexual pleasures that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is especially subject to the flesh; so much so that in the carnal act, according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Ep. ad Ageruch.), "not even the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> touches the heart of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>," nor "is it possible to understand anything in the midst of that pleasure," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 11). Therefore fruit corresponds to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> rather than to another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> takes fruit in a broad sense, according as any reward is called a fruit.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fruition does not take its name from fruit by reason of any comparison with fruit in the sense in which we speak of it now, as evidenced by what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Fruit, as we speak of it now, corresponds to labor not as resulting in fatigue, but as resulting in the production of fruit. Hence a man calls his crops his labor, inasmuch as he labored for them, or produced them by his labor. Now the comparison to fruit, as produced from seed, is more adapted to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> than to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not subjected to the flesh by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, as he is by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> with which <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is concerned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the pleasures of the table are more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> than the pleasures of sex, they are not so strong: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not so much subjected to the flesh thereby.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Fruit is not taken here in the sense in which fruition applies to delight in the end; but in another sense as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Hence the argument proves nothing.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether three fruits are fittingly assigned to the three parts of continence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that three fruits are unfittingly assigned to the three parts of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>: because twelve fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> are assigned, "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace," etc. (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians 5:22</a>). Therefore seemingly we should reckon only three.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, fruit denotes a special reward. Now the reward assigned to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is not a special reward, because all who are to be saved are comprised under one of these three, since no one is saved who lacks <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is adequately divided by these three. Therefore three fruits are unfittingly assigned to the three aforesaid.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a> surpasses conjugal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, so does <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> surpass <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a>. But the excess of sixtyfold over thirtyfold is not as the excess of a hundredfold over sixtyfold; neither in arithmetical proportion, since sixty exceeds thirty by thirty, and a hundred exceeds sixty by forty; nor in geometrical proportion, since sixty is twice thirty and a hundred surpasses sixty as containing the whole and two-thirds thereof. Therefore the fruits are unfittingly adapted to the degrees of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the statements contained in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> stand for all time: "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away" (<a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse33">Luke 21:33</a>): whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> institutions are liable to change every day. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> institutions are not to be taken as a criterion of the statements of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>: and it would seem in consequence that the explanation of these fruits given by <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> is unfitting. For he says (Expos. in Luc. iii, 8) that "the thirtyfold fruit is assigned to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, because in the signs drawn on the 'abacus' the number 30 is denoted by the thumb and index finger touching one another at the tips as though <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> one another: so that the number 30 denotes the embraces of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The number 60 is denoted by the contact of the index finger above the middle joint of the thumb, so that the index finger by lying over the thumb and weighing on it, signifies the burden which <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> have to bear in this world. When, however, in the course of enumeration we come to the number 100 we pass from the left to the right hand, so that the number 100 denotes <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, which has a share in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> excellence; for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are on the right hand, i.e. in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, while we are on the left on account of the imperfection of the present life."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, to which the fruit corresponds, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is brought to a kind of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, by withdrawing from carnal things. Consequently various fruits are distinguished according to the various manners of the spirituality resulting from <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>. Now there is a certain spirituality which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and one which is superabundant. The spirituality that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> consists in the rectitude of the spirit not being disturbed by the pleasures of the flesh: and this obtains when one makes use of carnal pleasures according to the order of right reason. This is the spirituality of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Spirituality is superabundant when a man withdraws himself entirely from those carnal pleasures which stifle the spirit. This may be done in two ways: either in respect of all time past, present, and future, and this is the spirituality of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>; or in respect of a particular time, and this is the spirituality of widows. Accordingly to those who keep conjugal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, the thirtyfold fruit is awarded; to those who keep the <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, the sixtyfold fruit; and to those who keep virginal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, the hundredfold fruit: and this for the reason given by <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> quoted above, although another motive may be found in the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the numbers. For 30 is the product of 3 multiplied by 10. Now 3 is the number of everything, as stated in De Coelo et Mundo i, and contains a certain perfection common to all, namely of beginning, middle, and end. Wherefore the number 30 is fittingly assigned to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, in whom no other perfection is added to the observance of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>, signified by the number 10, than the common perfection without which there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The number six the multiplication of which by 10 amounts to 60 has perfection from its parts, being the aggregate of all its parts taken together; wherefore it corresponds fittingly to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a>, wherein we find perfect withdrawal from carnal pleasures as to all its circumstances (which are the parts so to speak of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act), since <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a> uses no carnal pleasures in connection with any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, place, or any other circumstance; which was not the case with conjugal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>. The number 100 corresponds fittingly to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>; because the number 10 of which 100 is a multiple is the limit of numbers: and in like manner <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> occupies the limit of spirituality, since no further spirituality can be added to it. The number 100 also being a square number has perfection from its figure: for a square figure is perfect through being equal on all sides, since all its sides are equal: wherefore it is adapted to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> wherein incorruption is found equally as to all times.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fruit is not taken there in the sense in which we are taking it now.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliges</a> us to hold that fruit is a reward that is not common to all who will be saved. For not only the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward is common to all, but also a certain <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward, such as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in those works without which one cannot be saved. Yet it may be said that the fruits are not becoming to all who will be saved, as is evidently the case with those who repent in the end after leading an incontinent life, for to such no fruit is due but only the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The distinction of the fruits is to be taken according to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and figures of the numbers rather than according to their <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Nevertheless even if we regard the excess in point of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, we may find an explanation. For the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> abstains only from one that is not his, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> from both hers and not hers, so that in the latter case we find the notion of double, just as 60 is the double of 30. Again 100 is 60 X 40, which latter number is the product of 4 X 10, and the number 4 is the first solid and square number. Thus the addition of this number is fitting to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, which adds perpetual incorruption to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although these numerical signs are a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> institution, they are founded somewhat on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things, in so far as the numbers are denoted in gradation, according to the order of the aforesaid joints and contacts.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether an aureole is due on account of virginity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an aureole is not due on account of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. For where there is greater difficulty in the work, a greater reward is due. Now <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> have greater difficulty than <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in abstaining from the works of the flesh. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. ad Ageruch.) that the greater difficulty certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> experience in abstaining from the allurements of pleasure, the greater their reward, and he is speaking in praise of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anim. Hist. vii) that "young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who have been deflowered desire sexual intercourse the more for the recollection of the pleasure." Therefore the aureole which is the greatest reward is due to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> more than to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if an aureole were due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, it would be especially found where there is the most perfect <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Now the most perfect <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, wherefore she is called theVirgin of virgins: and yet no aureole is due to her because she experienced no conflict in being continent, for she was not infected with the corruption of the fomes [Cf. III, 27, 3]. Therefore an aureole is not due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a special reward is not due to that which has not been at all times praiseworthy. Now it would not have been praiseworthy to observe <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> in the state of innocence, since then was it commanded: "Increase and multiply and fill the earth" (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis 1:28</a>): nor again during the time of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, since the barren were <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">accursed</a>. Therefore an aureole is not due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the same reward is not due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> observed, and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> lost. Yet an aureole is sometimes due to lost <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>; for instance if a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maiden</a> be violated unwillingly at the order of a tyrant for confessing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore an aureole is not due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a special reward is not due to that which is in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is inborn in every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Therefore an aureole is not due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a> is to the sixtyfold fruit, so is <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> to the hundredfold fruit, and to the aureole. Now the sixtyfold fruit is not due to every <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, but only, as some say, to one who <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to remain a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. Therefore it would seem that neither is the aureole due to any kind of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, but only to that which is observed by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, reward is not given to that which is done of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, since all <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But some are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, such as those who are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> cold-blooded, and eunuchs. Therefore an aureole is not always due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse25">Exodus 25:25</a>: "Thou shalt also make a little golden crown [coronam aureolam]" says: "This crown denotes the new <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> which the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> sing in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>, those, to wit, who follow the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> whithersoever He goeth." Therefore the reward due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is called an aureole.

<p>Further, It is written (<a href="../bible/isa056.htm#verse4">Isaiah 56:4</a>): "Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to the eunuchs": and the text continues (<a href="../bible/isa056.htm#verse5">Isaiah 56:5</a>): "I will give to them . . . a name better than sons and daughters": and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, De Virginit. xxv] says: "This refers to their peculiar and transcendent <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Now the eunuchs "who have made themselves eunuchs for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew 19:12</a>) denote <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. Therefore it would seem that some special reward is due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and this is called the aureole.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Where there is a notable kind of victory, a special crown is due. Wherefore since by <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> wins a signal victory over the flesh, against which a continuous battle is waged: "The flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusteth</a> against the spirit," etc. (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians 5:17</a>), a special crown called the aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. This indeed is the common opinion of all; but all are not agreed as to the kind of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> to which it is due. For some say that the aureole is due to the act. So that she who actually remains a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> will have the aureole provided she be of the number of the saved. But this would seem unreasonable, because in this case those who have the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to marry and nevertheless die before marrying would have the aureole. Hence others hold that the aureole is due to the state and not to the act: so that those <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> alone <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the aureole who by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> have placed themselves in the state of observing perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. But this also seems unreasonable, because it is possible to have the same <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of observing <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> without a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> as with a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Hence it may be said otherwise that <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is due to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act commanded by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> comes under the genus of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in so far as perpetual incorruption of mind and body is an object of choice, as appears from what has been said above (Sent. iv, D, 33, 3, 1,2) [Cf. III, 152, 1,3]. Consequently the aureole is due to those <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> alone, who had the purpose of observing perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, whether or no they have confirmed this purpose by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>--and this I say with reference to the aureole in its proper signification of a reward due to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>--although this purpose may at some time have been interrupted, integrity of the flesh remaining withal, provided it be found at the end of life, because <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> may be restored, although <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of the flesh cannot. If, however, we take the aureole in its broad sense for any <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> added to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, the aureole will be applicable even to those who are incorrupt in flesh, although they had not the purpose of observing perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. For without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they will rejoice in the incorruption of their body, even as the innocent will rejoice in having been free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although they had no opportunity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> children. But this is not the proper meaning of an aureole, although it is very commonly taken in this sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In some respects <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> experience a greater conflict in remaining continent; and in other respects, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, other things being equal. For <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> are inflamed by <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, and by the desire of experience, which arises from a certain curiosity as it were, which makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> more willing to see what he has never seen. Sometimes, moreover, this <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is increased by their esteeming the pleasure to be greater than it is in reality, and by their failing to consider the grievances attaching to this pleasure. In these respects <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> experience the lesser conflict, yet theirs is the greater conflict by reason of their recollection of the pleasure. Moreover, in different subjects one motive is stronger than another, according to the various <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> and dispositions of the subject, because some are more susceptible to one, and others to another. However, whatever we may say of the degree of conflict, this is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>--that the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> victory is more perfect than the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a>, for the most perfect and most brilliant kind of victory is never to have yielded to the foe: and the crown is due, not to the battle but to the victory gained by the battle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There are two opinions about this. For some say that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> has not an aureole in reward of her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, if we take aureole in the proper sense as referring to a conflict, but that she has something more than an aureole, on account of her most perfect purpose of observing <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Others say that she has an aureole even in its proper signification, and that a most transcendent one: for though she experienced no conflict, she had a certain conflict of the flesh, but owing to the exceeding strength of her <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, her flesh was so subdued that she did not feel this conflict. This, however, would seem to be said without reason, for since we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> to have been altogether immune from the inclination of the fomes on account of the perfection of her sanctification, it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to suppose that there was in her any conflict with the flesh, since such like conflict is only from the inclination of the fomes, nor can <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> from the flesh be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as declared by a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, De Civ. Dei xix, 4 on <a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>, "There was given me a sting of my flesh." Hence we must say that she has an aureole properly speaking, so as to be conformed in this to those other members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in whom <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is found: and although she had no conflict by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> which is of the flesh, she had the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> which is of the enemy, who feared not even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm">Matthew 4</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The aureole is not due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> except as adding some excellence to the other degrees of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>. If <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> would have had no perfection over conjugal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, since in that case marriage would have been honorable, and the marriage-bed unsullied, for it would not have been dishonored by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: hence <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> would not then have been observed, nor would an aureole have been due to it. But the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> being changed, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> has a special beauty of its own, and consequently a special reward is assigned to it. During the time of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic law</a>, when the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was to be continued by means of the carnal act, it was not altogether praiseworthy to abstain from carnal intercourse: wherefore no special reward would be given for such a purpose unless it came from a Divine inspiration, as is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been the case with <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> and Elias, of whose marriage we do not read.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> If a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> is violated, she does not forfeit the aureole, provided she retain unfailingly the purpose of observing perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and nowise consent to the act. Nor does she forfeit <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> thereby; and be this said, whether she be violated for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or for any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whatever. But if she suffer this for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, this will count to her for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, and will be a kind of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/09414a.htm">Lucy</a> said: "If thou <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causest</a> me to be violated against my will, my <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> will receive a double crown" [<a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> of S. Lucy; lect. vi of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, December 13th]; not that she has two aureoles of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, but that she will receive a double reward, one for observing <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, the other for the outrage she has suffered. Even supposing that one thus violated should conceive, she would not for that reason forfeit her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>: nor would she be equal to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Christ's mother</a>, in whom there was integrity of the flesh together with integrity of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> [Cf. II-II, 64, 3, ad 3; II-II, 124, 4, ad 2; II-II, 152, 1].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">Virginity</a> is inborn in us as to that which is material in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>: but the purpose of observing perpetual incorruption, whence <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> derives its <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, is not inborn, but comes from the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The sixtyfold fruit is due, not to every <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, but only to those who retain the purpose of remaining <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, even though they do not make it the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, even as we have said in regard to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> If cold-blooded <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and eunuchs have the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to observe perpetual incorruption even though they were capable of sexual intercourse, they must be called <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the aureole: for they make a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. If, on the other hand, they have the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to marry if they could, they do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the aureole. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Sancta Virgin. xxiv): "For those like eunuchs whose bodies are so formed that they are unable to beget, it suffices when they become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and keep the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they have a mind to have a wife if they could, in order to rank with the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who are <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether an aureole is due to martyrs?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an aureole is not due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. For an aureole is a reward given for works of supererogation, wherefore <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse25">Exodus 25:25</a>, "Thou shalt also make another . . . crown," says: "This may be rightly referred to the reward of those who by freely choosing a more perfect life go beyond the general commandments." But to die for confessing the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is sometimes an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and not a work of supererogation as appears from the words of <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse10">Romans 10:10</a>, "With the heart, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unto <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but with the mouth confession is made unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>." Therefore an aureole is not always due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. ix [Cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, De Adult. Conjug. i, 14) "the freer the service, the more acceptable it is." Now <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> has a minimum of freedom, since it is a punishment inflicted by another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with force. Therefore an aureole is not due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, since it is accorded to surpassing <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> consists not only in suffering death externally, but also in the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a> distinguishes three kinds of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>--in will and not in death, as <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>; in both will and death, as <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">Stephen</a>; in death and not in will, as the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Innocents</a>. Accordingly if an aureole were due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, it would be due to <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> rather than external <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, since <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> proceeds from will. Yet such is not the case. Therefore an aureole is not due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, bodily suffering is less than <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a>, which consists of internal sorrow and affliction of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But internal suffering is also a kind of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Assumption</a> [Ep. ad Paul. et Eustoch.]: "I should say rightly that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> was both <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, although she ended her days in peace, wherefore: Thine own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a sword hath pierced--namely for her <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Son's</a> death." Since then no aureole corresponds to interior sorrow, neither should one correspond to outward suffering.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, penance itself is a kind of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. iii in Evang.): "Although <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> has ceased to offer the opportunity, yet the peace we enjoy is not without its <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>; since even if we no longer yield the life of the body to the sword, yet do we slay fleshly desires in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the sword of the spirit." But no aureole is due to penance which consists in external works. Neither therefore is an aureole due to every external <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, an aureole is not due to an unlawful work. Now it is unlawful to <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">lay hands on oneself</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Civ. Dei i), and yet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrates the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of some who <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">laid hands upon themselves</a> in order to escape the fury of tyrants, as in the case of certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, Eccles. Hist. viii, 24). Therefore an aureole is not always due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, it happens at times that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is wounded for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and survives for some time. Now it is clear that such a one is a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and yet seemingly an aureole is not due to him, since his conflict did not last until death. Therefore an aureole is not always due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, some suffer more from the loss of temporal goods than from the affliction even of their own body and this is shown by their bearing many afflictions for the sake of gain. Therefore if they be despoiled of their temporal goods for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake they would seem to be <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and yet an aureole is not apparently due to them. Therefore the same conclusion follows as before.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> would seem to be no other than one who dies for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, wherefore <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. vii): "They are called <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in Greek, <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> in Latin: because they suffered in order to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and strove unto death for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now there are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> more excellent than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and so forth, since these cannot be without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and yet no aureole is due to them. Therefore seemingly neither is an aureole due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 10.</strong> Further, even as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so is all other <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [Spurious work on <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>: "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can say," etc.] declares, since "every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by whomsoever uttered is from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore if an aureole is due to one who suffers death for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in like manner it is also due to those who suffer death for any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and yet apparently this is not the case.

<p><strong>Objection 11.</strong> Further, the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Now if a man die in a just <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in order to save his country, an aureole is not due to him. Therefore even though he be put to death in order to keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that is in himself, no aureole is due to him: and consequently the same conclusion follows as above.

<p><strong>Objection 12.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. Yet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrates the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">some</a> who had not the use of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. Therefore they did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> an aureole: and consequently an aureole is not due to all <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Sancta Virgin. xlvi): "No one, methinks, would dare prefer <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>." Now an aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and consequently also to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p>Further, the crown is due to one who has striven. But in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> the strife presents a special difficulty. Therefore a special aureole is due thereto.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as in the spirit there is a conflict with the internal <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, so is there in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a conflict with the passion that is inflicted from without. Wherefore, just as a special crown, which we call an aureole, is due to the most perfect victory whereby we triumph over the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> of the flesh, in a word to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, so too an aureole is due to the most perfect victory that is won against external assaults. Now the most perfect victory over passion <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> from without is considered from two points of view. First from the greatness of the passion. Now among all <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> inflicted from without, death holds the first place, just as sexual <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> are chief among internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Consequently, when a man conquers death and things directed to death, his is a most perfect victory. Secondly, the perfection of victory is considered from the point of view of the motive of conflict, when, to wit, a man strives for the most honorable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. Both these things are to be found in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, which is death suffered for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake: for "it is not the pain but the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that makes the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Crescon. iii). Consequently an aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> as well as to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To suffer death for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, is absolutely speaking, a work of supererogation; since every one is not bound to confess his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the face of a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutor</a>: yet in certain cases it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, when, to wit, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is seized by a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutor</a> and interrogated as to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he is then bound to confess. Nor does it follow that he does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> an aureole. For an aureole is due to a work of supererogation, not as such, but as having a certain perfection. Wherefore so long as this perfection remains, even though the supererogation cease, one <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> the aureole.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A reward is due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, not in respect of the exterior infliction, but because it is suffered <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>: since we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> only through that which is in us. And the more that which one suffers <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> is difficult and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> the more is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that suffers it for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake shown to be firmly established in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and consequently a higher reward is due to him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There are certain acts which, in their very selves, contain intense pleasure or difficulty: and in such the act always adds to the character of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit, for as much as in the performance of the act the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, on account of the aforesaid intensity, must needs undergo an alteration from the state in which it was before. Consequently, other things being equal, one who performs an act of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more than one who merely consents in the act, because in the very act the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is increased. In like manner since in the act of suffering <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> there is a very great difficulty, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to suffer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> does not reach the degree of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> due to actual <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> by reason of its difficulty: although, indeed it may possibly attain to a higher reward, if we consider the root of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to suffer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> may possibly proceed from a greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> than another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> act of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Hence one who is willing to be a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> may by his will <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward equal to or greater than that which is due to an actual <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. But the aureole is due to the difficulty inherent to the conflict itself of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>: wherefore it is not due to those who are <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> only in will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Just as pleasures of touch, which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, hold the chief place among all pleasures both internal and external, so pains of touch surpass all other pains. Consequently an aureole is due to the difficulty of suffering pains of touch, for instance, from blows and so forth, rather than to the difficulty of bearing internal sufferings, by reason of which, however, one is not properly called a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, except by a kind of comparison. It is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> speaks.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The sufferings of penance are not a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> properly speaking, because they do not consist in things directed to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> of death, since they are directed merely to the taming of the flesh: and if any one go beyond this measure, such afflictions will be deserving of blame. However such afflictions are spoken of as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> by a kind of comparison. and they surpass the sufferings of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in duration but not in intensity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei i) it is lawful to no one to <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">lay hands on himself</a> for any reason whatever; unless perchance it be done by Divine instinct as an example of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> that others may despise death. Those to whom the objection refers are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have brought death on themselves by Divine instinct, and for this reason the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrates their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> [Cf. II-II, 64, 5].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> If any one receive a mortal wound for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and survive, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> the aureole: as instanced in <a href="../cathen/03471b.htm">blessed Cecilia</a> who survived for three days, and many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. But, even if the wound he receives be not mortal, yet be the occasion of his dying, he is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the aureole: although some say that he does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the aureole if he happen to die through his own carelessness or neglect. For this neglect would not have occasioned his death, except on the supposition of the wound which he received for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: and consequently this wound previously received for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the original occasion of his death, so that he would not seem to lose. the aureole for that reason, unless his neglect were such as to involve a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which would deprive him of both aurea and aureole. If, however, by some chance or other he were not to die of the mortal wound received, or again if the wounds received were not mortal, and he were to die while in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, he would still <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the aureole. Hence the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of some <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for that they died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, having been wounded long before, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/09640b.htm">Pope Marcellus</a>. Accordingly in whatever way suffering for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake be continued unto death, whether death ensue or not, a man becomes a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> the aureole. If, however, it be not continued unto death, this is not a reason for calling a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, as in the case of the <a href="../cathen/14370a.htm">blessed Sylvester</a>, whose feast the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not solemnize as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a>, since he ended his days in peace, although previously he had undergone certain sufferings.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> Even as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not about pleasures of money, honors, and the like, but only about pleasures of touch as being the principal of all, so <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about dangers of death as being the greatest of all (Ethic. iii, 6). Consequently the aureole is due to such injuries only as are inflicted on a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> own body and are of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> death. Accordingly whether a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> lose his temporalities, or his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, or anything else of the kind, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, he does not for that reason become a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the aureole. Nor is it possible to love ordinately external things more than one's body; and inordinate love does not help one to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> an aureole: nor again can sorrow for the loss of corporeal things be equal to the sorrow for the slaying of the body and other like things [Cf. II-II, 124, 5].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> The sufficient motive for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is not only confession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not civic but infused, that has <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for its end. For one becomes a witness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act, inasmuch as the works which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> perfects in us bear witness to His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Hence some <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> were slain for <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> which they desired to keep, for instance <a href="../cathen/01214a.htm">blessed Agnes</a> and others whose <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is celebrated by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 10.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for end and object; and therefore the confession thereof, if suffering be added thereto, merits an aureole, not only on the part of the end but also on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But the confession of any other <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a sufficient motive for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but only on the part of the end; for instance if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> were willing to be slain for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake rather than <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against Him by telling any lie whatever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 11.</strong> The uncreated <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> surpasses all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> end, whether it be the common or a private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, cannot confer so great a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> on an act as can the uncreated end, when, to wit, an act is done for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake. Hence when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> dies for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> without referring it to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he will not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the aureole; but if he refer it to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> he will <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the aureole and he will be a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; for instance, if he defend his country from the attack of an enemy who designs to corrupt the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and suffer death in that defense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 12.</strong> Some say that the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> was by the Divine power accelerated in the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Innocents</a> slain for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, even as in <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> while yet in his <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">mother's</a> womb: and in that case they were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in both act and will, and have the aureole. Others say, however, that they were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in act only and not in will: and this seems to be the opinion of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a>, who distinguishes three kinds of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, as stated above (Objection 3). In this case the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Innocents</a>, even as they do not fulfill all the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and yet are <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in a sense, in that they died for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so too they have the aureole, not in all its perfection, but by a kind of participation, in so far as they rejoice in having. been slain in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> service; thus it was stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>) in reference to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> children, that they will have a certain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in their innocence and carnal integrity [Cf. II-II, 124, 1, ad 1, where <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> declares that the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a> were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.]

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether an aureole is due to doctors?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an aureole is not due to <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>. For every reward to be had in the life to come will correspond to some act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But preaching or teaching is not the act of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore an aureole is not due to teaching or preaching.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, teaching and preaching are the result of studying and being taught. Now the things that are rewarded in the future life are not acquired by a man's study, since we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> not by our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and acquired <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. Therefore no aureole will be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> in the future life for teaching and preaching.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, exaltation in the life to come corresponds to humiliation in the present life, because "he that humbleth himself shall be exalted" (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse12">Matthew 23:12</a>). But there is no humiliation in teaching and preaching, in fact they are occasions of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; for a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse5">Matthew 4:5</a>, "Then the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> took Him up," says that "the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> deceives many who are puffed up with the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the master's chair." Therefore it would seem that an aureole is not due to preaching and teaching.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse18">Ephesians 1:18-19</a>, "That you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> . . . what is the exceeding greatness," etc. says: "The holy <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> will have an increase of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> above that which all have in common." Therefore, etc.

<p>Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/son008.htm#verse12">Canticle of Canticles 8:12</a>, "My vineyard is before me," says: "He describes the peculiar reward which He has prepared for His <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> will have a peculiar reward: and we call this an aureole.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as by <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> wins a most perfect victory over the flesh and the world, so is a most perfect victory gained over the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> not only refuses to yield to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> assaults, but also drives him out, not from himself alone, but from others also. Now this is done by preaching and teaching: wherefore an aureole is due to preaching and teaching, even as to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Nor can we admit, as some affirm, that it is due to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> only, who are competent to preach and teach by virtue of their office. but it is due to all whosoever exercise this act lawfully. Nor is it due to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, although they have the office of preaching, unless they actually preach, since a crown is due not to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but to the actual strife, according to <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse5">2 Timothy 2:5</a>, "He . . . shall not be [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'is not'] crowned, except he strive lawfully."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Preaching and teaching are acts of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, namely mercy, wherefore they are reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> [Cf. II-II, 32, 2].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although ability to preach and teach is sometimes the outcome of study, the practice of teaching comes from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is informed with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> infused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and thus its act can be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Exaltation in this life does not lessen the reward of the other life, except for him who seeks his own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from that exaltation: whereas he who turns that exaltation to the profit of others acquires thereby a reward for himself. Still, when it is stated that an aureole is due to teaching, this is to be understood of the teaching of things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, by which teaching the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is expelled from men's hearts, as by a kind of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> weapon, of which it is said (<a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>): "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal but <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'but mighty to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'].

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether an aureole is due to Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For an aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and teaching. Now these three were pre-eminently in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore an aureole is especially due to Him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is most perfect in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things must ne especially ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now an aureole is due as the reward of most excellent merits. Therefore it is also due to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says (De Habit. Virg.) that "<a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> bears a likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore the exemplar of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it would seem that an aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> An aureole is described as "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in being conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Now no one is conformed or likened to himself, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph., lib. ix, 3). Therefore an aureole is not due to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> reward was never increased. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had no aureole from the moment of His conception, since then He had never fought. Therefore He never had an aureole afterwards.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two opinions on this point. For some say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has an aureole in its strict sense, seeing that in Him there is both conflict and victory, and consequently a crown in its proper acceptation. But if we consider the question carefully, although the notion of aurea or crown is becoming to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the notion of aureole is not. For from the very fact that aureole is a diminutive term it follows that it denotes something possessed by participation and not in its fulness. Wherefore an aureole is becoming to those who participate in the perfect victory by imitating Him in Whom the fulness of perfect victory is realized. And therefore, since in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the notion of victory is found chiefly and fully, for by His victory others are made victors--as shown by the words of <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John 16:33</a>, "Have confidence, I have overcome the world," and <a href="../bible/rev005.htm#verse5">Apocalypse 5:5</a>, "Behold the lion of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a> . . . hath prevailed"--it is not becoming for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to have an aureole, but to have something from which all aureoles are derived. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse21">Apocalypse 3:21</a>): "To him that shall overcome, I will give to sit with Me in My throne, as I also have overcome, and am set down in My Father's throne [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'With My Father in His throne']." Therefore we must say with others that although there is nothing of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an aureole in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, there is nevertheless something more excellent than any aureole.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctor</a>; yet the corresponding <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a negligible <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in comparison with the greatness of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward. Hence He has not an aureole in its proper sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the aureole is due to a most perfect work, yet with regard to us, so far as it is a diminutive term, it denotes the participation of a perfection derived from one in whom that perfection is found in its fulness. Accordingly it implies a certain inferiority, and thus it is not found in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in Whom is the fulness of every perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although in some way <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> has its exemplar in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that exemplar is not homogeneous. For the incorruption of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> imitates is not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the same way as in a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether an aureole is due to the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an aureole is due to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Serm. de Assump. [Ep. ad Paul. et Eustoch. ix]) speaking of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> says: "To live without the flesh while living in the flesh is to live as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> rather than as a man": and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse26">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>, "For the present <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>," says that "<a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is the portion of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." Since then an aureole corresponds to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, it would seem due to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, incorruption of the spirit is more excellent than incorruption of the flesh. Now there is incorruption of spirit in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, since they never <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Therefore an aureole is due to them rather than to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> incorrupt in the flesh and who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> at some time.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an aureole is due to teaching. Now <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> teach us by cleansing, enlightening, and perfecting [Cf. I, 111, 1] us, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Hier. Eccles. vi). Therefore at least the aureole of <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> is due to them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse5">2 Timothy 2:5</a>): "He . . . shall not be [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'is not'] crowned, except he strive lawfully." But there is no conflict in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore an aureole is not due to them.

<p>Further, an aureole is not due to an act that is not performed through the body: wherefore it is not due to lovers of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> or teaching, if they do not practice them outwardly. But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are incorporeal spirits. Therefore they have no aureole.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An aureole is not due to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The reason of this is that an aureole, properly speaking, corresponds to some perfection of surpassing <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Now those things which make for perfect <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are connatural to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or belong to their state in general, or to their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have not an aureole in the same sense as an aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">Virginity</a> is said to be an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> life, in so far as <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> imitate by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> what <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For it is not owing to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> abstain altogether from pleasures of the flesh, since they are incapable of such pleasures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Perpetual incorruption of the spirit in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward: because it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, since in them recovery is impossible after they have fallen [Cf. I, 64, 2].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The acts whereby the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> teach us belong to their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and their common state: wherefore they do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> an aureole thereby.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether an aureole is also due to the body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an aureole is also due to the body. For the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward is greater than the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowries</a> which belong to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward are not only in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but also in the body. Therefore there is also an aureole which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, punishment in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body corresponds to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through the body. Therefore a reward both in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and in body is due to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> gained through the body. But the aureole is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> through works of the body. Therefore an aureole is also due to the body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a certain fulness of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> will shine forth in the bodies of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and will be seen in their bodily scars: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxii): "We feel an undescribable love for the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> so as to desire to see in that kingdom the scars of the wounds in their bodies, which they bore for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name. Perchance indeed we shall see them, for this will not make them less comely, but more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>. A certain beauty will shine in them, a beauty, though in the body, yet not of the body but of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> aureole is also in his body; and in like manner the aureoles of others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> now in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> have aureoles; and yet they have no body. Therefore the proper subject of an aureole is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and not the body.

<p>Further, all <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the whole reward should be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Properly speaking the aureole is in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>: since it is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the works to which an aureole is due. But even as from the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, which is the aurea, there results a certain comeliness in the body, which is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body, so from the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the aureole there results a certain bodily comeliness: so that the aureole is chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but by a kind of overflow it shines forth in the body.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections. It must be observed, however, that the beauty of the scars which will appear in the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> cannot be called an aureole, since some of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> will have an aureole in which such scars will not appear, for instance those who were put to death by drowning, starvation, or the squalor of prison.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether three aureoles are fittingly assigned, those of virgins, of martyrs, and of doctors?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the three aureoles of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> are unfittingly assigned. For the aureole of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> corresponds to their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, the aureole of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and the aureole of <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore it seems that there should be a fourth aureole corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse25">Exodus 25:25</a>: "A polished crown, etc. says that a golden [aurea] crown is added, when the Gospel promises eternal life to those who keep the commandments: 'If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments' (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse17">Matthew 19:17</a>). To this is added the little golden crown [aureola] when it is said: 'If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor'" (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>). Therefore an aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man subjects himself wholly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a>: wherefore the greatest perfection consists in the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a>. Therefore it would seem that an aureole is due thereto.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, there are also many other works of supererogation in which one will rejoice in the life to come. Therefore there are many aureoles besides the aforesaid three.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, just as a man spreads the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by preaching and teaching, so does he by publishing written works. Therefore a fourth aureole is due to those who do this.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An aureole is an exceptional reward corresponding to an exceptional victory: wherefore the three aureoles are assigned in accordance with the exceptional victories in the three conflicts which beset every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For in the conflict with the flesh, he above all wins the victory who abstains altogether from sexual pleasures which are the chief of this kind; and such is a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. Wherefore an aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. In the conflict with the world, the chief victory is to suffer the world's <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> even until death: wherefore the second aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who win the victory in this battle. In the conflict with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, the chief victory is to expel the enemy not only from oneself but also from the hearts of others: this is done by teaching and preaching, and consequently the third aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> and preachers.

<p>Some, however, distinguish the three aureoles in accordance with the three powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by saying that the three aureoles correspond to the three chief acts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> three highest powers. For the act of the rational power is to publish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> even to others, and to this act the aureole of <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> is due: the highest act of the irascible power is to overcome even death for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, and to this act the aureole of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> is due: and the highest act of the concupiscible power is to abstain altogether from the greatest carnal pleasures, and to this act the aureole of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> is due.

<p>Others again, distinguish the three aureoles in accordance with those things whereby we are most signally conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For He was the mediator between the Father and the world. Hence He was a <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctor</a>, by manifesting to the world the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which He had received from the Father; He was a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, by suffering the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the world; and He was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, by His personal purity. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> are most perfectly conformed to Him: and for this reason an aureole is due to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is no conflict to be observed in the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> as in the acts of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Nor is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that to teach is an act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>: in fact rather is it an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> or mercy--inasmuch as it is by such like <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> that we are inclined to the practice of such an act--or again of wisdom, as directing it.

<p>We may also reply, with others, that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> embraces all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, wherefore a special aureole is not due to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> is a work of perfection, it does not take the highest place in a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> conflict, because the love of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">temporalities</a> assails a man less than carnal <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> or <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> whereby his own body is broken. Hence an aureole is not due to <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>; but judicial power by reason of the humiliation consequent upon <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> quoted takes aureole in the broad sense for any reward given for excellent <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p>We reply in the same way to the Third and Fourth Objections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> An aureole is due to those who commit the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> to writing: but it is not distinct from the aureole of <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, since the compiling of writing is a way of teaching.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether the virgin's aureole is the greatest of all?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> aureole is the greatest of all. For it is said of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> (<a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse4">Apocalypse 14:4</a>) that they "follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth," and (<a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse3">Apocalypse 14:3</a>) that "no" other "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could say the <a href="../cathen/03301a.htm">canticle</a>" which the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> sang. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> have the most excellent aureole.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> (De Habit. Virg.) says of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> that they are "the more illustrious portion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flock." Therefore the greater aureole is due to them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Again, it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> aureole is the greatest. For Aymo, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse3">Apocalypse 14:3</a>, "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could say the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>," says that "<a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> do not all take precedence of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> folk; but only those who in addition to the observance of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> are by the tortures of their passion on a par with <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> gives <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> its precedence over other states: and consequently a greater aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Again, it would seem that the greatest aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant is modelled after the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> triumphant. Now in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant the greatest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse17">1 Timothy 5:17</a>): "Let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that rule well be esteemed worthy of double <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine." Therefore a greater aureole is due to them in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> triumphant.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Precedence of one aureole over another may be considered from two standpoints. First, from the point of view of the conflicts, that aureole being considered greater which is due to the more strenuous battle. Looking at it thus the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> aureole takes precedence of the others in one way, and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> in another. For the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> battle is more strenuous in itself, and more intensely painful; while the conflict with the flesh is fraught with greater danger, inasmuch as it is more lasting and threatens us at closer quarters. Secondly, from the point of view of the things about which the battle is fought: and thus the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctor</a>'s aureole takes precedence of all others, since this conflict is about intelligible goods. while the other conflicts are about sensible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Nevertheless, the precedence that is considered in view of the conflict is more <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the aureole; since the aureole, according to its proper character, regards the victory and the battle, and the difficulty of fighting which is viewed from the standpoint of the battle is of greater importance than that which is considered from our standpoint through the conflict being at closer quarters. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> aureole is simply the greatest of all: for which reason a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse10">Matthew 5:10</a>, says that "all the other <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are perfected in the eighth, which refers to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>," namely, "<a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">Blessed</a> are they that suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>." For this reason, too, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in enumerating the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> together places the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> before the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. Yet nothing hinders the other aureoles from being more excellent in some particular way. And this suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article13">Article 13. Whether one person has an aureole more excellently than another person?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has not the aureole either of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, or of doctrine more perfectly than another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For things which have reached their term are not subject to intension or remission. Now the aureole is due to works which have reached their term of perfection. Therefore an aureole is not subject to intension or remission.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not subject to being more or less, since it denotes a kind of privation; and privations are not subject to intension or remission. Therefore neither does the reward of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> aureole to wit, receive intension or remission.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The aureole is added to the aurea. But the aurea is more intense in one than in another. Therefore the aureole is also.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is somewhat the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of reward, rewards must needs be diversified, according as <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> are diversified: for the intension or remission of a thing follows from the intension or remission of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of the aureole may be greater or lesser: wherefore the aureole may also be greater or lesser.

<p>We must observe, however, that the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of an aureole may be intensified in two ways: first, on the part of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, secondly on the part of the work. For there may happen to be two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, one of whom, out of lesser <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, suffers greater torments of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, or is more constant in preaching, or again withdraws himself more from carnal pleasures. Accordingly, intension not of the aureole but of the aurea corresponds to the intension of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> derived from its root; while intension of the aureole corresponds to intension of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> derived from the kind of act. Consequently it is possible for one who <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> less in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> as to his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, to receive a greater aureole for his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The merits to which an aureole is due do not reach the term of their perfection simply, but according to their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: even as fire is specifically the most subtle of bodies. Hence nothing hinders one aureole being more excellent than another, even as one fire is more subtle than another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of one may be greater than the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of another, by reason of a greater withdrawal from that which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>: so that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is stated to be greater in one who avoids more the occasions of corruption. For in this way privations may increase, as when a man is said to be more blind, if he be removed further from the possession of sight.
