<h1>Question 96. The mastership belonging to man in the state of innocence</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1096.htm#article1"> Was man in the state of innocence master over the animals?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1096.htm#article2"> Was he master over all creatures?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1096.htm#article3"> In the state of innocence, were all men equal?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1096.htm#article4"> Would man in that state have been master over men?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Adam in the state of innocence had mastership over the animals?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had no mastership over the animals. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 14), that the animals were brought to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, to receive their names from him. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> need not have intervened thus, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself were master over the animals. Therefore in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had no mastership of the animals.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is unfitting that elements hostile to one another should be brought under the mastership of one. But many animals are hostile to one another, as the sheep and the wolf. Therefore all animals were not brought under the mastership of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says [The words quoted are not in <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> works. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> may have had in mind <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, Hexaem., as quoted in the Glossa ordinaria on <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> mastership over the animals, although before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he had no need of them: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foresaw that after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> animals would become useful to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore, at least before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it was unfitting for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to make use of his mastership.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is proper to a master to command. But a command is not given rightly save to a rational being. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had no mastership over the irrational animals.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>): "Let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the beasts of the earth" [Vulg."and the whole earth"].

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As above stated (95, 1) for his disobedience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was punished by the disobedience of those creatures which should be subject to him. Therefore in the state of innocence, before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had disobeyed, nothing disobeyed him that was <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> subject to him. Now all animals are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. This can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in three ways.

<p>First, from the order observed by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for just as in the generation of things we perceive a certain order of procession of the perfect from the imperfect (thus <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is for the sake of form; and the imperfect form, for the sake of the perfect), so also is there order in the use of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things; thus the imperfect are for the use of the perfect; as the plants make use of the earth for their nourishment, and animals make use of plants, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes use of both plants and animals. Therefore it is in keeping with the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be master over animals. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 5) that the hunting of wild animals is just and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> thereby exercises a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right.

<p>Secondly, this is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the order of Divine Providence which always governs inferior things by the superior. Wherefore, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, being made to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is above other animals, these are rightly subject to his government.

<p>Thirdly, this is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from a property of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and of other animals. For we see in the latter a certain participated <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, in regard to certain particular acts; whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> possesses a universal <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> as regards all practical matters. Now whatever is participated is subject to what is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> and universal. Therefore the subjection of other animals to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A higher power can do many things that an inferior power cannot do to those which are subject to them. Now an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> higher than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore certain things in regard to animals could be done by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which could not be done by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for instance, the rapid gathering together of all the animals.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the opinion of some, those animals which now are fierce and kill others, would, in that state, have been tame, not only in regard to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but also in regard to other animals. But this is quite unreasonable. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of animals was not changed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as if those whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> now it is to devour the flesh of others, would then have lived on herbs, as the lion and falcon. Nor does <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede's</a> <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse30">Genesis 1:30</a>, say that trees and herbs were given as food to all animals and birds, but to some. Thus there would have been a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> antipathy between some animals. They would not, however, on this account have been excepted from the mastership of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: as neither at present are they for that reason excepted from the mastership of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose Providence has ordained all this. Of this Providence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have been the executor, as appears even now in regard to domestic animals, since fowls are given by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as food to the trained falcon.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not have had any bodily need of animals--neither for clothing, since then they were naked and not ashamed, there being no inordinate motions of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>--nor for food, since they fed on the trees of paradise--nor to carry him about, his body being strong enough for that purpose. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needed animals in order to have experimental <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. This is signified by the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> led the animals to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that he might give them names expressive of their respective <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> All animals by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> instinct have a certain participation of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and reason: which accounts for the fact that cranes follow their leader, and bees obey their queen. So all animals would have obeyed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of their own accord, as in the present state some domestic animals obey him.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether man had mastership over all other creatures?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not have had mastership over all other creatures. For an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> has a greater power than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 8), "corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> would not have obeyed even the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." Much less therefore would it have obeyed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the only powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in plants are nutritive, augmentative, and generative. Now these doe not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> obey reason; as we can see in the case of any one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore, since it is by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is competent to have mastership, it seems that in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had no dominion over plants.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whosoever is master of a thing, can change it. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not have changed the course of the heavenly bodies; for this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Ep. ad Polycarp. vii). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had no dominion over them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>): "That he may have dominion over . . . every creature."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Man in a certain sense contains all things; and so according as he is master of what is within himself, in the same way he can have mastership over other things. Now we may consider four things in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: his "reason," which makes him like to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>'; his "sensitive powers," whereby he is like the animals; his "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forces," which liken him to the plants; and "the body itself," wherein he is like to inanimate things. Now in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> reason has the position of a master and not of a subject. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had no mastership over the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the primitive state; so when we read "all creatures," we must understand the creatures which are not made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image. Over the sensitive powers, as the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, which obey reason in some degree, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has mastership by commanding. So in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had mastership over the animals by commanding them. But of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers and the body itself <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is master not by commanding, but by using them. Thus also in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mastership over plants and inanimate things consisted not in commanding or in changing them, but in making use of them without hindrance.

<p>The answers to the objections appear from the above.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether men were equal in the state of innocence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the state of innocence all would have been equal. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxi): "Where there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there is no inequality." But in the state of innocence there was no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore all were equal.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, likeness and equality are the basis of mutual love, according to <a href="../bible/sir013.htm#verse19">Sirach 13:19</a>, "Every beast loveth its like; so also every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> him that is nearest to himself." Now in that state there was among men an abundance of love, which is the bond of peace. Therefore all were equal in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> ceasing, the effect also ceases. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of present inequality among men seems to arise, on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from the fact that He rewards some and punishes others; and on the part of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, from the fact that some, through a defect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, are born weak and deficient, others strong and perfect, which would not have been the case in the primitive state. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>): "The things which are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are well ordered" [Vulg."Those that are, are ordained of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"]. But order chiefly consists in inequality; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 13): "Order disposes things equal and unequal in their proper place." Therefore in the primitive state, which was most proper and orderly, inequality would have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must needs admit that in the primitive state there would have been some inequality, at least as regards sex, because generation depends upon diversity of sex: and likewise as regards age; for some would have been born of others; nor would sexual union have been sterile.

<p>Moreover, as regards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, there would have been inequality as to righteousness and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> worked not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, but of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, by virtue of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can apply himself, more or less, to action, desire, or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; hence some would have made a greater advance in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than others.

<p>There might also have been bodily disparity. For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was not entirely exempt from the laws of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so as not to receive from exterior sources more or less advantage and help: since indeed it was dependent on food wherewith to sustain life.

<p>So we may say that, according to the climate, or the movement of the stars, some would have been born more robust in body than others, and also greater, and more beautiful, and all ways better disposed; so that, however, in those who were thus surpassed, there would have been no defect or fault either in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By those words <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> means to exclude such inequality as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> between <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>; the result of which is that some are placed in subjection to others as a penalty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Equality is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of equality in mutual love. Yet between those who are unequal there can be a greater love than between equals; although there be not an equal response: for a father <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> loves his son more than a brother loves his brother; although the son does not love his father as much as he is loved by him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of inequality could be on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not indeed that He would punish some and reward others, but that He would exalt some above others; so that the beauty of order would the more shine forth among men. Inequality might also arise on the part of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as above described, without any defect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether in the state of innocence man would have been master over man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not have been master over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 15): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> willed that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who was endowed with reason and made to His image, should rule over none but irrational creatures; not over men, but over cattle."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what came into the world as a penalty for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would not have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the state of innocence. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as a penalty; for after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> it was said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis 3:16</a>): "Thou shalt be under thy husband's power." Therefore in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not have been subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, subjection is opposed to liberty. But liberty is one of the chief blessings, and would not have been lacking in the state of innocence, "where nothing was wanting that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> good-will could desire," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not have been master over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the state of innocence was not more exalted than the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> some rule over others; and so one order is called that of "Dominations." Therefore it was not beneath the dignity of the state of innocence that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be subject to another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Mastership has a twofold meaning.

<p>First, as opposed to slavery, in which sense a master means one to whom another is subject as a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>. In another sense mastership is referred in a general sense to any kind of subject; and in this sense even he who has the office of governing and directing free men, can be called a master. In the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could have been a master of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not in the former but in the latter sense. This distinction is founded on the reason that a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> differs from a free <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in that the latter has the disposal of himself, as is stated in the beginning of the Metaphysics, whereas a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is ordered to another. So that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is master of another as his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> when he refers the one whose master he is, to his own--namely the master's use. And since every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is desirable to himself, and consequently it is a grievous <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to anyone to yield to another what ought to be one's own, therefore such dominion implies of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> a pain inflicted on the subject; and consequently in the state of innocence such a mastership could not have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>But a man is the master of a free subject, by directing him either towards his proper welfare, or to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Such a kind of mastership would have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the state of innocence between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for two reasons.

<p>First, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> a social being, and so in the state of innocence he would have led a social life. Now a social life cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> among a number of people unless under the presidency of one to look after the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for many, as such, seek many things, whereas one attends only to one. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says, in the beginning of the Politics, that wherever many things are directed to one, we shall always find one at the head directing them.

<p>Secondly, if one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> surpassed another in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, this would not have been fitting unless these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> conduced to the benefit of others, according to <a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse10">1 Peter 4:10</a>, "As every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, ministering the same one to another." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 14): "Just men command not by the love of domineering, but by the service of counsel": and (De Civ. Dei xix, 15): "The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order of things requires this; and thus did <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p>From this appear the replies to the objections which are founded on the first-mentioned mode of mastership.
