<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether human law should be framed for the community rather than for the individual?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should be framed not for the community, but rather for the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 7) that "the legal just . . . includes all particular acts of legislation . . . and all those matters which are the subject of decrees," which are also <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> matters, since decrees are framed about <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> actions. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is framed not only for the community, but also for the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is the director of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, as stated above (90, A1,2). But <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are about <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> matters. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws should be framed, not for the community, but rather for the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is a rule and measure of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, as stated above (90, A1,2). But a measure should be most certain, as stated in Metaph. x. Since therefore in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> no general proposition can be so certain as not to fail in some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> cases, it seems that laws should be framed not in general but for <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> cases.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The jurist says (Pandect. Justin. lib. i, tit. iii, art. ii; De legibus, etc.) that "laws should be made to suit the majority of instances; and they are not framed according to what may possibly happen in an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> case."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whatever is for an end should be proportionate to that end. Now the end of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; because, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 21) that "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should be framed, not for any private benefit, but for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of all the citizens." Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws should be proportionate to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> comprises many things. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should take account of many things, as to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as to matters, and as to times. Because the community of the state is composed of many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is procured by many actions; nor is it established to endure for only a short time, but to last for all time by the citizens succeeding one another, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ii, 21; xxii, 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 7) divides the legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, i.e. positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, into three parts. For some things are laid down simply in a general way: and these are the general laws. Of these he says that "the legal is that which originally was a matter of indifference, but which, when enacted, is so no longer": as the fixing of the ransom of a captive. Some things affect the community in one respect, and <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> in another. These are called "privileges," i.e. "private laws," as it were, because they regard private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, although their power extends to many matters; and in regard to these, he adds, "and further, all particular acts of legislation." Other matters are legal, not through being laws, but through being applications of general laws to particular cases: such are decrees which have the force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; and in regard to these, he adds "all matters subject to decrees."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A principle of direction should be applicable to many; wherefore (Metaph. x, text. 4) the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that all things belonging to one genus, are measured by one, which is the principle in that genus. For if there were as many rules or measures as there are things measured or ruled, they would cease to be of use, since their use consists in being applicable to many things. Hence <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> would be of no use, if it did not extend further than to one single act. Because the decrees than to one single act. Because the decrees of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> men are made for the purpose of directing <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> actions; whereas <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is a general precept, as stated above (92, 2, Objection 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> "We must not seek the same degree of <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> in all things" (Ethic. i, 3). Consequently in contingent matters, such as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things, it is enough for a thing to be certain, as being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the greater number of instances, though at times and less frequently it fail.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it belongs to the human law to repress all vices?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to repress all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 20) that "laws were made in order that, in fear thereof, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> audacity might be held in check." But it would not be held in check sufficiently, unless all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> were repressed by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws should repress all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver is to make the citizens <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. But a man cannot be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> unless he forbear from all kinds of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Therefore it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to repress all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, as stated above (Question 95, Article 2). But all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should repress all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We read in De Lib. Arb. i, 5: "It seems to me that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which is written for the governing of the people rightly permits these things, and that <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> punishes them." But <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> punishes nothing but <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> rightly allows some <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, by not repressing them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (90, A1,2), <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is framed as a rule or measure of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. Now a measure should be homogeneous with that which it measures, as stated in Metaph. x, text. 3,4, since different things are measured by different measures. Wherefore laws imposed on men should also be in keeping with their <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, for, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 21), <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should be "possible both according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and according to the customs of the country." Now possibility or faculty of action is due to an interior <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or disposition: since the same thing is not possible to one who has not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as is possible to one who has. Thus the same is not possible to a child as to a full-grown <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for which reason the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for children is not the same as for adults, since many things are permitted to children, which in an adult are punished by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> or at any rate are open to blame. In like manner many things are permissible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> not perfect in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which would be intolerable in a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is framed for a number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, the majority of whom are not perfect in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws do not forbid all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, from which the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> abstain, but only the more grievous <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, from which it is possible for the majority to abstain; and chiefly those that are to the hurt of others, without the prohibition of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society could not be maintained: thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> prohibits <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and such like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Audacity seems to refer to the assailing of others. Consequently it belongs to those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> chiefly whereby one's neighbor is injured: and these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forbidden by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The purpose of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is to lead men to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not suddenly, but gradually. Wherefore it does not lay upon the multitude of imperfect men the burdens of those who are already <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, viz. that they should abstain from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Otherwise these imperfect ones, being unable to bear such precepts, would break out into yet greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: thus it is written (<a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse33">Psalm 30:33</a>): "He that violently bloweth his nose, bringeth out blood"; and (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse17">Matthew 9:17</a>) that if "new wine," i.e. precepts of a perfect life, "is put into old bottles," i.e. into imperfect men, "the bottles break, and the wine runneth out," i.e. the precepts are despised, and those men, from contempt, break into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> worse still.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is a participation in us of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: while <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> falls short of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5): "The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which is framed for the government of states, allows and leaves unpunished many things that are punished by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>. Nor, if this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not attempt to do everything, is this a reason why it should be blamed for what it does." Wherefore, too, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not prohibit everything that is forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether human law prescribes acts of all the virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not prescribe acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> acts are contrary to acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not prohibit all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore neither does it prescribe all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the end of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; so that whatever is from a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, cannot come under a precept of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not prescribe all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (Question 90, Article 2). But some acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are ordained, not to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but to private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not prescribe all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1) that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> "prescribes the performance of the acts of a brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> . . . and the acts of the temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> . . . and the acts of the meek <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and in like manner as regards the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, prescribing the former, forbidding the latter."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are distinguished by their objects, as explained above (54, 2; 60, 1; 62, 2). Now all the objects of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can be referred either to the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, or to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the multitude: thus matters of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> may be achieved either for the safety of the state, or for upholding the rights of a friend, and in like manner with the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (Question 90, Article 2) is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whose acts cannot be prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not prescribe concerning all the acts of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: but only in regard to those that are ordainable to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--either immediately, as when certain things are done directly for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--or mediately, as when a lawgiver prescribes certain things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> order, whereby the citizens are directed in the upholding of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and peace.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not forbid all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> acts, by the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a precept, as neither does it prescribe all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But it forbids certain acts of each <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, just as it prescribes some acts of each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An act is said to be an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in two ways. First, from the fact that a man does something <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>; thus the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is to do what is right, and an act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is to do brave things: and in this way <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> prescribes certain acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Secondly an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is when a man does a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> thing in a way in which a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does it. Such an act always proceeds from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and it does not come under a precept of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but is the end at which every lawgiver aims.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whose act is not ordainable to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above, either mediately or immediately.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether human law binds a man in conscience?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not bind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. For an inferior power has no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in a court of higher power. But the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which frames <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, is beneath the Divine power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> cannot impose its precept in a Divine court, such as is the court of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the judgment of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> depends chiefly on the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But sometimes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandments are made void by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws, according to <a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse6">Matthew 15:6</a>: "You have made void the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for your tradition." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not bind a man in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws often bring loss of character and injury on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa010.htm#verse1">Isaiah 10:1 et seqq.</a>: "Woe to them that make <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> laws, and when they write, write <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; to oppress the poor in judgment, and do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> of My people." But it is lawful for anyone to avoid oppression and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws do not bind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse19">1 Peter 2:19</a>): "This is thankworthy, if for <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> . . . a man endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Laws framed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are either just or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. If they be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, they have the power of binding in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> whence they are derived, according to <a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse15">Proverbs 8:15</a>: "By Me kings reign, and lawgivers decree just things." Now laws are said to be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, both from the end, when, to wit, they are ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--and from their author, that is to say, when the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that is made does not exceed the power of the lawgiver--and from their form, when, to wit, burdens are laid on the subjects, according to an equality of proportion and with a view to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For, since one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a part of the community, each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in all that he is and has, belongs to the community; just as a part, in all that it is, belongs to the whole; wherefore <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inflicts a loss on the part, in order to save the whole: so that on this account, such laws as these, which impose proportionate burdens, are just and binding in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and are legal laws.

<p>On the other hand laws may be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> in two ways: first, by being contrary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, through being opposed to the things mentioned above--either in respect of the end, as when an authority imposes on his subjects burdensome laws, conducive, not to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but rather to his own cupidity or vainglory--or in respect of the author, as when a man makes a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that goes beyond the power committed to him--or in respect of the form, as when burdens are imposed unequally on the community, although with a view to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. The like are acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> rather than laws; because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5), "a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that is not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, seems to be no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at all." Wherefore such laws do not bind in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, except perhaps in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> or disturbance, for which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a man should even yield his right, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse40">Matthew 5:40-41</a>: "If a man . . . take away thy coat, let go thy cloak also unto him; and whosoever will force thee one mile, go with him other two."

<p>Secondly, laws may be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> through being opposed to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: such are the laws of tyrants inducing to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, or to anything else contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>: and laws of this kind must nowise be observed, because, as stated in <a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse29">Acts 5:29</a>, "we ought to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1-2</a>), all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . "therefore he that resisteth the power," in matters that are within its scope, "resisteth the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; so that he becomes guilty according to his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of laws that are contrary to the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is beyond the scope of (<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>) power. Wherefore in such matters <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should not be obeyed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that inflicts <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> hurt on its subjects. The power that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> holds from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not extend to this: wherefore neither in such matters is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> bound to obey the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, provided he avoid giving <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> or inflicting a more grievous hurt.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether all are subject to the law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not all are subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For those alone are subject to a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for whom a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is made. But the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse9">1 Timothy 1:9</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not made for the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore the just are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Pope Urban says [Decretals. caus. xix, qu. 2]: "He that is guided by a private <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> need not for any reason be bound by the public <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." Now all <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> men are led by the private <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for they are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of whom it is said (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse14">Romans 8:14</a>): "Whosoever are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, they are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore not all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the jurist says [Pandect. Justin. i, ff., tit. 3, De Leg. et Senat.] that "the sovereign is exempt from the laws." But he that is exempt from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not bound thereby. Therefore not all are subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>): "Let every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be subject to the higher powers." But subjection to a power seems to imply subjection to the laws framed by that power. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should be subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (90, A1,2; 3, ad 2), the notion of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> contains two things: first, that it is a rule of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>; secondly, that it has coercive power. Wherefore a man may be subject to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in two ways. First, as the regulated is subject to the regulator: and, in this way, whoever is subject to a power, is subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> framed by that power. But it may happen in two ways that one is not subject to a power. In one way, by being altogether free from its authority: hence the subjects of one city or kingdom are not bound by the laws of the sovereign of another city or kingdom, since they are not subject to his authority. In another way, by being under a yet higher <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; thus the subject of a proconsul should be ruled by his command, but not in those matters in which the subject receives his orders from the emperor: for in these matters, he is not bound by the mandate of the lower authority, since he is directed by that of a higher. In this way, one who is simply subject to a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, may not be a subject thereto in certain matters, in respect of which he is ruled by a higher <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p>Secondly, a man is said to be subject to a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> as the coerced is subject to the coercer. In this way the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and righteous are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but only the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Because coercion and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> are contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, whereas the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is discordant from it. Wherefore in this sense the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but only the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of subjection by way of coercion: for, in this way, "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not made for the just men": because "they are a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to themselves," since they "show the work of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> written in their hearts," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse14">Romans 2:14-15</a>). Consequently the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not enforce itself upon them as it does on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is above all <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> framed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> men, in so far as they are led by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in those matters that are inconsistent with the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Nevertheless the very fact that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> men are subject to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, is due to the leading of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse13">1 Peter 2:13</a>: "Be ye subject . . . to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> creature for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The sovereign is said to be "exempt from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>," as to its coercive power; since, properly speaking, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is coerced by himself, and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has no coercive power save from the authority of the sovereign. Thus then is the sovereign said to be exempt from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, because none is competent to pass sentence on him, if he acts against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Wherefore on <a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse6">Psalm 50:6</a>: "To Thee only have I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that "there is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who can judge the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of a king." But as to the directive force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, the sovereign is subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> by his own will, according to the statement (Extra, De Constit. cap. Cum omnes) that "whatever <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> a man makes for another, he should keep himself. And a wise authority [Dionysius Cato, Dist. de Moribus] says: 'Obey the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that thou makest thyself.'" Moreover the Lord reproaches those who "say and do not"; and who "bind heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders, but with a finger of their own they will not move them" (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse3">Matthew 23:3-4</a>). Hence, in the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the sovereign is not exempt from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as to its directive force; but he should fulfil it to his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> and not of constraint. Again the sovereign is above the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in so far as, when it is expedient, he can change the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and dispense in it according to time and place.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether he who is under a law may act beside the letter of the law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that he who is subject to a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> may not act beside the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. 31): "Although men judge about temporal laws when they make them, yet when once they are made they must pass judgment not on them, but according to them." But if anyone disregard the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, saying that he observes the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver, he seems to pass judgment on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore it is not right for one who is under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to disregard the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in order to observe the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he alone is competent to interpret the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> who can make the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But those who are subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> cannot make the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore they have no right to interpret the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver, but should always act according to the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to explain his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> by words. But those who framed the laws should be reckoned wise: for Wisdom says (<a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse15">Proverbs 8:15</a>): "By Me kings reign, and lawgivers decree just things." Therefore we should not judge of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver otherwise than by the words of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. iv): "The meaning of what is said is according to the motive for saying it: because things are not subject to speech, but speech to things." Therefore we should take account of the motive of the lawgiver, rather than of his very words.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is directed to the common weal of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and derives the force and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> accordingly. Hence the jurist says [Pandect. Justin. lib. i, ff., tit. 3, De Leg. et Senat.]: "By no reason of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, or favor of equity, is it allowable for us to interpret harshly, and render burdensome, those useful measures which have been enacted for the welfare of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Now it happens often that the observance of some point of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> conduces to the common weal in the majority of instances, and yet, in some cases, is very hurtful. Since then the lawgiver cannot have in view every single case, he shapes the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> according to what happens most frequently, by directing his attention to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore if a case arise wherein the observance of that <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> would be hurtful to the general welfare, it should not be observed. For instance, suppose that in a besieged city it be an established <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that the gates of the city are to be kept closed, this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for public welfare as a general rule: but, it were to happen that the enemy are in pursuit of certain citizens, who are defenders of the city, it would be a great loss to the city, if the gates were not opened to them: and so in that case the gates ought to be opened, contrary to the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in order to maintain the common weal, which the lawgiver had in view.

<p>Nevertheless it must be noted, that if the observance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> according to the letter does not involve any sudden risk needing instant remedy, it is not competent for everyone to expound what is useful and what is not useful to the state: those alone can do this who are in authority, and who, on account of such like cases, have the power to dispense from the laws. If, however, the peril be so sudden as not to allow of the delay involved by referring the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to authority, the mere <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> brings with it a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, since <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He who in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> acts beside the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, does not judge the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; but of a particular case in which he sees that the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not to be observed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He who follows the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver, does not interpret the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> simply; but in a case in which it is evident, by reason of the manifest harm, that the lawgiver intended otherwise. For if it be a matter of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, he must either act according to the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, or consult those in power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is so wise as to be able to take account of every single case; wherefore he is not able sufficiently to express in words all those things that are suitable for the end he has in view. And even if a lawgiver were able to take all the cases into consideration, he ought not to mention them all, in order to avoid confusion: but should frame the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> according to that which is of most common occurrence.
