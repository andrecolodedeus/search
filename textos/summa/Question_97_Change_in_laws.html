<h1>Question 97. Change in laws</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2097.htm#article1"> Is human law changeable?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2097.htm#article2"> Should it be always changed, whenever anything better occurs?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2097.htm#article3"> Is it abolished by custom, and does custom obtain the force of law?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2097.htm#article4"> Should the application of human law be changed by dispensation of those in authority?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether human law should be changed in any way?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should not be changed in any way at all. Because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, as stated above (Question 95, Article 2). But the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> endures unchangeably. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should also remain without any change.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 5), a measure should be absolutely stable. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is the measure of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, as stated above (90, A1,2). Therefore it should remain without change.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to be just and right, as stated above (Question 95, Article 2). But that which is right once is right always. Therefore that which is <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> once, should be always <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 6): "A temporal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, however <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, may be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> changed in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 91, Article 3), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is a dictate of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are directed. Thus there may be two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> for the just change of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: one on the part of reason; the other on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whose acts are regulated by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on the part of reason is that it seems <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> to advance gradually from the imperfect to the perfect. Hence, in speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, we see that the teaching of the early <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> was imperfect, and that it was afterwards perfected by those who succeeded them. So also in practical matters: for those who first endeavored to discover something useful for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> community, not being able by themselves to take everything into consideration, set up certain institutions which were deficient in many ways; and these were changed by subsequent lawgivers who made institutions that might <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> less frequently deficient in respect of the common weal.

<p>On the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whose acts are regulated by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can be rightly changed on account of the changed <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to whom different things are expedient according to the difference of his condition. An example is proposed by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Lib. Arb. i, 6): "If the people have a sense of moderation and responsibility, and are most careful guardians of the common weal, it is right to enact a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> allowing such a people to choose their own magistrates for the government of the commonwealth. But if, as time goes on, the same people become so corrupt as to sell their votes, and entrust the government to scoundrels and criminals; then the right of appointing their public officials is rightly forfeit to such a people, and the choice devolves to a few <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is a participation of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (Question 91, Article 2), and therefore endures without change, owing to the unchangeableness and perfection of the Divine <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>, the Author of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the reason of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is changeable and imperfect: wherefore his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is subject to change. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> contains certain universal precepts, which are everlasting: whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> contains certain particular precepts, according to various emergencies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A measure should be as enduring as possible. But nothing can be absolutely unchangeable in things that are subject to change. And therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> cannot be altogether unchangeable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In corporal things, right is predicated absolutely: and therefore, as far as itself is concerned, always remains right. But right is predicated of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> with reference to the common weal, to which one and the same thing is not always adapted, as stated above: wherefore rectitude of this kind is subject to change.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether human law should always be changed, whenever something better occurs?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should be changed, whenever something better occurs. Because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws are devised by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, like other arts. But in the other arts, the tenets of former times give place to others, if something better occurs. Therefore the same should apply to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by taking note of the past we can provide for the future. Now unless <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws had been changed when it was found possible to improve them, considerable inconvenience would have ensued; because the laws of old were crude in many points. Therefore it seems that laws should be changed, whenever anything better occurs to be enacted.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws are enacted about single acts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But we cannot acquire perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in singular matters, except by experience, which "requires time," as stated in Ethic. ii. Therefore it seems that as time goes on it is possible for something better to occur for legislation.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated in the Decretals (Dist. xii, 5): "It is absurd, and a detestable shame, that we should suffer those traditions to be changed which we have received from the fathers of old."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is rightly changed, in so far as such change is conducive to the common weal. But, to a certain extent, the mere change of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is of itself prejudicial to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: because custom avails much for the observance of laws, seeing that what is done contrary to general custom, even in slight matters, is looked upon as grave. Consequently, when a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is changed, the binding power of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is diminished, in so far as custom is abolished. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should never be changed, unless, in some way or other, the common weal be compensated according to the extent of the harm done in this respect. Such compensation may arise either from some very great and every evident benefit conferred by the new enactment; or from the extreme urgency of the case, due to the fact that either the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is clearly <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, or its observance extremely harmful. Wherefore the jurist says [Pandect. Justin. lib. i, ff., tit. 4, De Constit. Princip.] that "in establishing new laws, there should be evidence of the benefit to be derived, before departing from a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which has long been considered just."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Rules of art derive their force from reason alone: and therefore whenever something better occurs, the rule followed hitherto should be changed. But "laws derive very great force from custom," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Polit. ii, 5): consequently they should not be quickly changed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument proves that laws ought to be changed: not in view of any improvement, but for the sake of a great benefit or in a case of great urgency, as stated above. This answer applies also to the Third Objection.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether custom can obtain force of law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that custom cannot obtain force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, nor abolish a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> and from the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, as stated above (93, 3; 95, 2). But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> custom cannot change either the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Therefore neither can it change <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> cannot make one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But he who first acted against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore by multiplying such acts, nothing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the result. Now a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; since it is a rule of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not abolished by custom, so that the mere custom should obtain force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the framing of laws belongs to those public men whose business it is to govern the community; wherefore private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> cannot make laws. But custom grows by the acts of private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Therefore custom cannot obtain force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, so as to abolish the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Casulan. xxxvi): "The customs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people and the institutions of our ancestors are to be considered as laws. And those who throw contempt on the customs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to be punished as those who disobey the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> proceeds from the reason and will of the lawgiver; the Divine and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> laws from the reasonable will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, regulated by reason. Now just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and will, in practical matters, may be made manifest by speech, so may they be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>: since seemingly a man chooses as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that which he carries into execution. But it is evident that by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> speech, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can be both changed and expounded, in so far as it manifests the interior movement and thought of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Wherefore by actions also, especially if they be repeated, so as to make a custom, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can be changed and expounded; and also something can be established which obtains force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in so far as by repeated external actions, the inward movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and concepts of reason are most effectually declared; for when a thing is done again and again, it seems to proceed from a deliberate judgment of reason. Accordingly, custom has the force of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, abolishes <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and is the interpreter of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and Divine laws proceed from the Divine will, as stated above. Wherefore they cannot be changed by a custom proceeding from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but only by Divine authority. Hence it is that no custom can prevail over the Divine or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> laws: for <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Synon. ii, 16): "Let custom yield to authority: <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> customs should be eradicated by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and reason."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (Question 96, Article 6), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws fail in some cases: wherefore it is possible sometimes to act beside the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; namely, in a case where the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> fails; yet the act will not be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And when such cases are multiplied, by reason of some change in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, then custom shows that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is no longer useful: just as it might be declared by the verbal promulgation of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to the contrary. If, however, the same reason remains, for which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was useful hitherto, then it is not the custom that prevails against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that overcomes the custom: unless perhaps the sole reason for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> seeming useless, be that it is not "possible according to the custom of the country" [95, 3], which has been stated to be one of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For it is not easy to set aside the custom of a whole people.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The people among whom a custom is introduced may be of two <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. For if they are free, and able to make their own laws, the consent of the whole people expressed by a custom counts far more in favor of a particular observance, that does the authority of the sovereign, who has not the power to frame laws, except as representing the people. Wherefore although each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> cannot make laws, yet the whole people can. If however the people have not the free power to make their own laws, or to abolish a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> made by a higher authority; nevertheless with such a people a prevailing custom obtains force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in so far as it is tolerated by those to whom it belongs to make laws for that people: because by the very fact that they tolerate it they seem to approve of that which is introduced by custom.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the rulers of the people can dispense from human laws?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the rulers of the people cannot dispense from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws. For the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is established for the "common weal," as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 21). But the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> should not be set aside for the private convenience of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>: because, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 2), "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the nation is more godlike than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore it seems that a man should not be dispensed from acting in compliance with the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those who are placed over others are commanded as follows (<a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy 1:17</a>): "You shall hear the little as well as the great; neither shall you respect any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, because it is the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But to allow one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to do that which is equally forbidden to all, seems to be respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Therefore the rulers of a community cannot grant such dispensations, since this is against a precept of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in order to be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, should accord with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and Divine laws: else it would not "foster religion," nor be "helpful to discipline," which is requisite to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as laid down by <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. v, 3). But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can dispense from the Divine and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> laws. Neither, therefore, can he dispense from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 9:17</a>): "A dispensation is committed to me."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Dispensation, properly speaking, denotes a measuring out to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> of some common goods: thus the head of a household is called a dispenser, because to each member of the household he distributes work and necessaries of life in due weight and measure. Accordingly in every community a man is said to dispense, from the very fact that he directs how some general precept is to be fulfilled by each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Now it happens at times that a precept, which is conducive to the common weal as a general rule, is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a particular <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, or in some particular case, either because it would hinder some greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or because it would be the occasion of some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as explained above (Question 96, Article 6). But it would be dangerous to leave this to the discretion of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, except perhaps by reason of an evident and sudden emergency, as stated above (Question 96, Article 6). Consequently he who is placed over a community is empowered to dispense in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that rests upon his authority, so that, when the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> fails in its application to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or circumstances, he may allow the precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> not to be observed. If however he grant this permission without any such reason, and of his mere will, he will be an unfaithful or an imprudent dispenser: unfaithful, if he has not the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in view; imprudent, if he ignores the reasons for granting dispensations. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse42">Luke 12:42</a>): "Who, thinkest thou, is the faithful and wise dispenser [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: steward], whom his lord setteth over his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is dispensed from observing the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, this should not be done to the prejudice of, but with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of benefiting, the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> if unequal measures are served out to those who are themselves unequal. Wherefore when the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> requires that he should reasonably receive special treatment, it is not respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> if he be the object of special favor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Natural <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, so far as it contains general precepts, which never fail, does not allow of dispensations. In other precepts, however, which are as conclusions of the general precepts, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sometimes grants a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>: for instance, that a loan should not be paid back to the betrayer of his country, or something similar. But to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stands as a private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to the public <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to which he is subject. Wherefore just as none can dispense from public <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, except the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from whom the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> derives its authority, or his delegate; so, in the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, which are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, none can dispense but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to whom He may give special power for that purpose.
