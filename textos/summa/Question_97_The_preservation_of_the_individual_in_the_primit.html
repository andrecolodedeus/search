<h1>Question 97. The preservation of the individual in the primitive state</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1097.htm#article1"> Was man in the state of innocence immortal?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1097.htm#article2"> Was he impassible?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1097.htm#article3"> Did he stand in need of food?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1097.htm#article4"> Would he have obtained immortality by the tree of life?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether in the state of innocence man would have been immortal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. For the term "mortal" belongs to the definition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But if you take away the definition, you take away the thing defined. Therefore as long as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> he could not be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, corruptible and incorruptible are generically distinct, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. x, Did. ix, 10). But there can be no passing from one genus to another. Therefore if the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was incorruptible, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not be corruptible in the present state.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> in the state of innocence, this would have been due either to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Not to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not change within the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, he would also have been <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> now. Likewise neither would this be owing to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> recovered <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by repentance, according to <a href="../bible/wis010.htm#verse2">Wisdom 10:2</a>: "He brought him out of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Hence he would have regained his <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; which is clearly not the case. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> is promised to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as a reward, according to <a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse4">Apocalypse 21:4</a>: "Death shall be no more." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the state of reward, but that he might deserve the reward. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>): "By <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> death came into the world." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may be incorruptible in three ways.

<p>First, on the part of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>--that is to say, either because it possesses no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, like an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; or because it possesses <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to one form only, like the heavenly bodies. Such things as these are incorruptible by their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Secondly, a thing is incorruptible in its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, inasmuch as being by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> corruptible, yet it has an inherent disposition which preserves it wholly from corruption; and this is called incorruptibility of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; because as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Dioscor.): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of such a powerful <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that from its fulness of beatitude, there redounds to the body a fulness of health, with the vigor of incorruption."

<p>Thirdly, a thing may be incorruptible on the part of its efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; in this sense <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was incorruptible and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> in the state of innocence. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. Vet. et Nov. Test. qu. 19 [Work of an anonymous author, among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> as long as he did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; so that he might achieve for himself life or death." For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body was indissoluble not by reason of any intrinsic vigor of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, but by reason of a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> force given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whereby it was enabled to preserve the body from all corruption so long as it remained itself subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This entirely agrees with reason; for since the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> surpasses the capacity of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as above explained (76, 1), it was most properly endowed at the beginning with the power of preserving the body in a manner surpassing the capacity of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1 and 2</strong> These objections are founded on <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> incorruptibility and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This power of preserving the body was not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but was the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> recovered <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as regards remission of guilt and the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; yet he did not recover <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, the loss of which was an effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for this was reserved for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to accomplish, by Whom the defect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was to be restored into something better, as we shall explain further on (III, 14, 4, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The promised reward of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> differs from the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> which was bestowed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the state of innocence.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether in the state of innocence man would have been passible?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was passible. For "sensation is a kind of passion." But in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have been sensitive. Therefore he would have been passible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sleep is a kind of passion. Now, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> slept in the state of innocence, according to <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse21">Genesis 2:21</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cast a deep sleep upon <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>." Therefore he would have been passible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same passage goes on to say that "He took a rib out of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>." Therefore he was passible even to the degree of the cutting out of part of his body.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body was soft. But a soft body is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> passible as regards a hard body; therefore if a hard body had come in contact with the soft body of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the latter would have suffered from the impact. Therefore the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was passible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Had <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> been passible, he would have been also corruptible, because, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Top. vi, 3): "Excessive suffering wastes the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> "<a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>" may be taken in two senses.

<p>First, in its proper sense, and thus a thing is said to suffer when changed from its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition. For passion is the effect of action; and in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> contraries are mutually active or passive, according as one thing changes another from its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition.

<p>Secondly, "passion" can be taken in a general sense for any kind of change, even if belonging to the perfecting process of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Thus understanding and sensation are said to be <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. In this second sense, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was passible in the state of innocence, and was passive both in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. In the first sense, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was impassible, both in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, as he was likewise <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; for he could curb his passion, as he could avoid death, so long as he refrained from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Thus it is clear how to reply to the first two objections; since sensation and sleep do not remove from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition, but are ordered to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> welfare.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As already explained (92, 3, ad 2), the rib was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> as the principle of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, as the semen in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is a principle through generation. Hence as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not suffer any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> deterioration by seminal issue; so neither did he through the separation of the rib.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> body in the state of innocence could be preserved from suffering injury from a hard body; partly by the use of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whereby he could avoid what was harmful; and partly also by Divine Providence, so preserving him, that nothing of a harmful <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> could come upon him unawares.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether in the state of innocence man had need of food?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did not require food. For food is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to restore what he has lost. But <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> body suffered no loss, as being incorruptible. Therefore he had no need of food.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, food is needed for nourishment. But nourishment involves passibility. Since, then, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body was impassible; it does not appear how food could be needful to him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we need food for the preservation of life. But <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> could preserve his life otherwise; for had he not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, he would not have died. Therefore he did not require food.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the consumption of food involves voiding of the surplus, which seems unsuitable to the state of innocence. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did not take food in the primitive state.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse16">Genesis 2:16</a>): "Of every tree in paradise ye shall [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> 'thou shalt'] eat."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had an animal life requiring food; but after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> he will have a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life needing no food. In order to make this clear, we must observe that the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and spirit. It is called a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by reason of what it possesses in common with other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>--that is, as giving life to the body; whence it is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse7">Genesis 2:7</a>): "Man was made into a living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"; that is, a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> giving life to the body. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is called a spirit according to what properly belongs to itself, and not to other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as possessing an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> immaterial power.

<p>Thus in the primitive state, the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> communicated to the body what belonged to itself as a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and so the body was called "animal" [From 'anima', a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; Cf. <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse44">1 Corinthians 15:44</a> seqq.], through having its life from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now the first principle of life in these inferior creatures as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 4) is the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: the operations of which are the use of food, generation, and growth. Wherefore such operations befitted <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the state of innocence. But in the final state, after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will, to a certain extent, communicate to the body what properly belongs to itself as a spirit; <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> to everyone; impassibility, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and power to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whose bodies will be called "<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>." So, after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will not require food; whereas he required it in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. Vet. et Nov. Test. qu. 19 [Works of an anonymous author, among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>): "How could <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> body, which was sustained by food? Since an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> being needs neither food nor drink." For we have explained (1) that the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the primitive state was based on a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> force in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and not on any intrinsic disposition of the body: so that by the action of heat, the body might lose part of its humid <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>; and to prevent the entire consumption of the humor, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take food.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A certain passion and alteration attends nutriment, on the part of the food changed into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the thing nourished. So we cannot thence conclude that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body was passible, but that the food taken was passible; although this kind of passion conduced to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not taken food he would have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; as he also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by taking the forbidden fruit. For he was told at the same time, to abstain from the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and to eat of every other tree of Paradise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Some say that in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not have taken more than <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> food, so that there would have been nothing superfluous; which, however, is unreasonable to suppose, as implying that there would have been no faecal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Wherefore there was need for voiding the surplus, yet so disposed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to be decorous and suitable to the state.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether in the state of innocence man would have acquired immortality by the tree of life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the tree of life could not be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. For nothing can act beyond its own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; as an effect does not exceed its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But the tree of life was corruptible, otherwise it could not be taken as food; since food is changed into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the thing nourished. Therefore the tree of life could not give incorruptibility or <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, effects <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the forces of plants and other <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agencies are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. If therefore the tree of life <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, this would have been <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this would seem to be reduced to the ancient fable, that the gods, by eating a certain food, became <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> ridicules (Metaph. iii, Did. ii, 4).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse22">Genesis 3:22</a>): "Lest perhaps he put forth his hand, and take of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever." Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. Vet. et Nov. Test. qu. 19 [Work of an anonymous author, among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>): "A taste of the tree of life warded off corruption of the body; and even after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have remained <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, had he been allowed to eat of the tree of life."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The tree of life in a certain degree was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, but not absolutely. To understand this, we must observe that in the primitive state <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> possessed, for the preservation of life, two remedies, against two defects. One of these defects was the lost of humidity by the action of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat, which acts as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> instrument: as a remedy against such loss <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was provided with food, taken from the other trees of paradise, as now we are provided with the food, which we take for the same purpose. The second defect, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Gener. i, 5), arises from the fact that the humor which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> from extraneous sources, being added to the humor already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, lessens the specific active power: as water added to wine takes at first the taste of wine, then, as more water is added, the strength of the wine is diminished, till the wine becomes watery. In like manner, we may observe that at first the active force of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is so strong that it is able to transform so much of the food as is required to replace the lost tissue, as well as what suffices for growth; later on, however, the assimilated food does not suffice for growth, but only replaces what is lost. Last of all, in old age, it does not suffice even for this purpose; whereupon the body declines, and finally dies from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Against this defect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was provided with a remedy in the tree of life; for its effect was to strengthen the force of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> against the weakness resulting from the admixture of extraneous nutriment. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 26): "Man had food to appease his hunger, drink to slake his thirst; and the tree of life to banish the breaking up of old age"; and (QQ. Vet. et Nov. Test. qu. 19 [Work of an anonymous author, among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>) "The tree of life, like a drug, warded off all bodily corruption."

<p>Yet it did not absolutely <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; for neither was the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> intrinsic power of preserving the body due to the tree of life, nor was it of such efficiency as to give the body a disposition to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, whereby it might become indissoluble; which is clear from the fact that every bodily power is finite; so the power of the tree of life could not go so far as to give the body the prerogative of living for an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> time, but only for a definite time. For it is manifest that the greater a force is, the more durable is its effect; therefore, since the power of the tree of life was finite, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life was to be preserved for a definite time by partaking of it once; and when that time had elapsed, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was to be either transferred to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, or had need to eat once more of the tree of life.

<p>From this the replies to the objections clearly appear. For the first proves that the tree of life did not absolutely <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; while the others show that it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> incorruption by warding off corruption, according to the explanation above given.
