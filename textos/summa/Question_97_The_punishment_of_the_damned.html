<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether in hell the damned are tormented by the sole punishment of fire?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> the damned are tormented by the sole punishment of fire; because <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew 25:41</a>, where their condemnation is declared, mention is made of fire only, in the words: "Depart from Me, you cursed, into everlasting fire."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, even as the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> is due to venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so is the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> due to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now no other punishment but that of fire is stated to be in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, as appears from the words of <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>: "The fire shall try every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> work, of what sort it is." Therefore neither in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> will there be a punishment other than of fire.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, variety of punishment affords a respite, as when one passes from heat to cold. But we can admit no respite in the damned. Therefore there will not be various punishments, but that of fire alone.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse7">Psalm 10:7</a>): "Fire and brimstone and storms of winds shall be the portion of their cup."

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/job024.htm#verse19">Job 24:19</a>): "Let him pass from the snow waters to excessive heat."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> (Homilia vi in Hexaemeron and Hom. i in Ps. 38), at the final cleansing of the world, there will be a separation of the elements, whatever is pure and noble remaining above for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the blessed, and whatever is ignoble and sordid being cast down for the punishment of the damned: so that just as every creature will be to the blessed a matter of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, so will all the elements conduce to the torture of the damned, according to <a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse21">Wisdom 5:21</a>, "the whole world will fight with Him against the unwise." This is also becoming to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that whereas they departed from one by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and placed their end in material things which are many and various, so should they be tormented in many ways and from many sources.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is because fire is most painful, through its abundance of active force, that the name of fire is given to any torment if it be intense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> is not intended chiefly to torment but to cleanse: wherefore it should be inflicted by fire alone which is above all possessed of cleansing power. But the punishment of the damned is not directed to their cleansing. Consequently the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The damned will pass from the most intense heat to the most intense cold without this giving them any respite: because they will suffer from external agencies, not by the transmutation of their body from its original <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition, and the contrary passion affording a respite by restoring an equable or moderate temperature, as happens now, but by a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> action, in the same way as sensible objects act on the senses being perceived by impressing the organ with their forms according to their <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and not their material being.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the worm of the damned is corporeal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the worm by which the damned are tormented is corporeal, because flesh cannot be tormented by a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> worm. Now the flesh of the damned will be tormented by a worm: "He will give fire and worms into their flesh" (<a href="../bible/jth016.htm#verse21">Judith 16:21</a>), and: "The vengeance on the flesh of the ungodly is fire and worms" (<a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse19">Sirach 7:19</a>). Therefore that worm will be corporeal.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 9): . . . "Both, namely fire and worm, will be the punishment of the body." Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xx, 22): "The unquenchable fire and the restless worm in the punishment of the damned are explained in various ways by different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Some refer both to the body, some, both to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: others refer the fire, in the literal sense, to the body, the worm to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> metaphorically: and this seems the more probable."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> After the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>, no animal or mixed body will remain in the renewed world except only the body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because the former are not directed to incorruption [Cf. 91, 5], nor after that time will there be generation or corruption. Consequently the worm ascribed to the damned must be understood to be not of a corporeal but of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and this is the remorse of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, which is called a worm because it originates from the corruption of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and torments the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as a corporeal worm born of corruption torments by gnawing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The very <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the damned are called their flesh for as much as they were subject to the flesh. Or we may reply that the flesh will be tormented by the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> worm, according as the afflictions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> overflow into the body, both here and hereafter.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks by way of comparison. For he does not wish to assert absolutely that this worm is material, but that it is better to say that both are to be understood materially, than that both should be understood only in a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense: for then the damned would suffer no bodily pain. This is clear to anyone that examines the context of his words in this passage.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the weeping of the damned will be corporeal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the weeping of the damned will be corporeal. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse28">Luke 13:28</a>, "There will be weeping," says that "the weeping with which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> threatens the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>." But this would not be the case if that weeping were merely <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the pain of the punishment corresponds to the pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rev018.htm#verse7">Apocalypse 18:7</a>: "As much as she hath glorified herself and lived in delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye to her." Now sinners had internal and external pleasure in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore they will also have external weeping.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Corporeal weeping results from dissolving into tears. Now there cannot be a continual dissolution from the bodies of the damned, since nothing is restored to them by food; for everything finite is consumed if something be continually taken from it. Therefore the weeping of the damned will not be corporeal.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things are to be observed in corporeal weeping. One is the resolution of tears: and as to this corporeal weeping cannot be in the damned, since after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>, the movement of the first movable being being at an end, there will be neither generation, nor corruption, nor bodily alteration: and in the resolution of tears that humor needs to be generated which is shed forth in the shape of tears. Wherefore in this respect it will be impossible for corporeal weeping to be in the damned. The other thing to be observed in corporeal weeping is a certain commotion and disturbance of the head and eyes, and in this respect weeping will be possible in the damned after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>: for the bodies of the damned will be tormented not only from without, but also from within, according as the body is affected at the instance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> passion towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In this sense weeping is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the body's <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, and corresponds to the pleasure of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, experienced by both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the damned are in material darkness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the damned are not in material darkness. For <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/job010.htm#verse22">Job 10:22</a>, "But everlasting horror dwelleth," <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (<a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">Moral</a>. ix): "Although that fire will give no light for comfort, yet, that it may torment the more it does give light for a purpose, for by the light of its flame the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will see their followers whom they have drawn thither from the world." Therefore the darkness there is not material.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the damned see their own punishment, for this increases their punishment. But nothing is seen without light. Therefore there is no material darkness there.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there the damned will have the power of sight after being reunited to their bodies. But this power would be useless to them unless they see something. Therefore, since nothing is seen unless it be in the light, it would seem that they are not in absolute darkness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse13">Matthew 22:13</a>): "Bind his hands and his feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness." Commenting on these words <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (<a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">Moral</a>. ix): If this fire gave any light, "he would by no means be described as cast into exterior darkness."

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> says (Hom. i in Ps. 28:7, "The voice of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> divideth the flame of fire") that "by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> might the brightness of the fire will be separated from its power of burning, so that its brightness will conduce to the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the blessed, and the heat of the flame to the torment of the damned." Therefore the damned will be in material darkness.

<p>Other points relating to the punishment of the damned have been decided above (<a href="#86">Article 86</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The disposition of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> will be such as to be adapted to the utmost unhappiness of the damned. Wherefore accordingly both light and darkness are there, in so far as they are most conducive to the unhappiness of the damned. Now seeing is in itself pleasant for, as stated in Metaph. i, "the sense of sight is most esteemed, because thereby many things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>."

<p>Yet it happens <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> that seeing is painful, when we see things that are hurtful to us, or displeasing to our will. Consequently in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> the place must be so disposed for seeing as regards light and darkness, that nothing be seen clearly, and that only such things be dimly seen as are able to bring anguish to the heart. Wherefore, simply speaking, the place is dark. Yet by Divine disposition, there is a certain amount of light, as much as suffices for seeing those things which are capable of tormenting the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> situation of the place is enough for this, since in the centre of the earth, where <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is said to be, fire cannot be otherwise than thick and cloudy, and reeky as it were.

<p>Some hold that this darkness is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the massing together of the bodies of the damned, which will so fill the place of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> with their numbers, that no air will remain, so that there will be no translucid body that can be the subject of light and darkness, except the eyes of the damned, which will be darkened utterly.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the fire of hell will be corporeal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> whereby the bodies of the damned will be tormented will not be corporeal. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv): The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and "<a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and his men" [Cf. <a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>: "And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be revealed, the son of perdition."], namely <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, "together with the ungodly and sinners will be cast into everlasting fire, not material fire, such as that which we have, but such as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>." Now everything corporeal is material. Therefore the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> will not be corporeal.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the damned when severed from their bodies are cast into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> fire. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 32): "In my opinion the place to which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is committed after death is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and not corporeal." Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, corporeal fire in the mode of its action does not follow the mode of guilt in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is burned at the stake, rather does it follow the mode of humid and dry: for in the same corporeal fire we see both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> suffer. But the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, in its mode of torture or action, follows the mode of guilt in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> punished; wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. iv, 63): "There is indeed but one <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> fire, but it does not torture all sinners equally. For each one will suffer as much pain according as his guilt deserves." Therefore this fire will not be corporeal.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> He says (Dial. iv, 29): "I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is corporeal, since it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that bodies are tortured there."

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse21">Wisdom 5:21</a>): "The . . . world shall fight . . . against the unwise." But the whole world would not fight against the unwise if they were punished with a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and not a corporeal punishment. Therefore they will be punished with a corporeal fire.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There have been many opinions about the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. For some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>, disbelieving in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, thought that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone would be punished after death. And as they considered it impossible for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, being incorporeal, to be punished with a corporeal fire, they denied that the fire whereby the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are punished is corporeal, and pretended that all statements as to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> being punished in future after death by any corporeal means are to be taken metaphorically. For just as the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will not be about any corporeal object, but about something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, namely the attainment of their end, so will the torment of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> be merely <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, in that they will be grieved at being separated from their end, the desire whereof is in them by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore, just as all descriptions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> delight after death that seem to denote bodily pleasure--for instance, that they are refreshed, that they smile, and so forth--must be taken metaphorically, so also are all such descriptions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> suffering as seem to imply bodily punishment--for instance, that they burn in fire, or suffer from the stench, and so forth. For as <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasure and pain are unknown to the majority, these things need to be declared under the figure of corporeal pleasures and pains, in order that men may be moved the more to the desire or fear thereof. Since, however, in the punishment of the damned there will be not only pain of loss corresponding to the aversion that was in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also pain of sense corresponding to the conversion, it follows that it is not enough to hold the above manner of punishment. For this reason <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> himself (Met. ix) added another explanation, by saying that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are punished after death, not by bodies but by images of bodies; just as in a dream it seems to a man that he is suffering various pains on account of such like images being in his <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Even <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> seems to hold this kind of punishment (Gen. ad lit. xii, 32), as is clear from the text. But this would seem an unreasonable statement. For the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is a power that makes use of a bodily organ: so that it is impossible for such <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> to occur in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body, as in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the dreamer. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> also that he might avoid this difficulty, said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body uses as an organ some part of the heavenly body, to which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body needs to be conformed, in order to be perfected by the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is like the movers of the heavenly body--thus following somewhat the opinion of certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of old, who maintained that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> return to the stars that are their compeers. But this is absolutely absurd according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher's</a> teaching, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> uses a definite bodily organ, even as art uses definite instruments, so that it cannot pass from one body to another, as <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoras</a> is stated (De Anima i, text. 53) to have maintained. As to the statement of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> we shall say below how it is to be answered (ad 2). However, whatever we may say of the fire that torments the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, we must admit that the fire which will torment the bodies of the damned after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is corporeal, since one cannot fittingly apply a punishment to a body unless that punishment itself be bodily. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Dial. iv) proves the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> to be corporeal from the very fact that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will be cast thither after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. Again <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, as quoted in the text of Sentent. iv, D, 44, clearly admits (De Civ. Dei xxi, 10) that the fire by which the bodies are tormented is corporeal. And this is the point at issue for the present. We have said elsewhere (70, 3) how the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the damned are punished by this corporeal fire.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> does not absolutely deny that this fire is material, but that it is material as our fire, since it differs from ours in some of its properties. We may also reply that since that fire does not alter bodies as to their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but acts on them for their punishment by a kind of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> action, it is for this reason that it is stated not to be material, not as regards its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but as to its punitive effect on bodies and, still more, on <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The assertion of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> may be taken in this way, that the place whither <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are conveyed after death be described as incorporeal, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is there, not corporeally, i.e. as bodies are in a place, but in some other <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> way, as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are in a place. Or we may reply that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is expressing an opinion without deciding the point, as he often does in those books.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That fire will be the instrument of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> inflicting punishment. Now an instrument acts not only by its own power and in its own way, but also by the power of the principal agent, and as directed thereby. Wherefore although fire is not able, of its own power, to torture certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> more or less, according to the measure of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is able to do so nevertheless in so far as its action is regulated by the ordering of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: even so the fire of the furnace is regulated by the forethought of the smith, according as the effect of his art requires.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the fire of hell is of the same species as ours?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this fire is not of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as the corporeal fire which we see. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xx, 16): "In my opinion no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of what kind is the everlasting fire, unless the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> has revealed it to anyone." But all or nearly all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this fire of ours. Therefore that fire is not of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as this.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/job010.htm#verse26">Job 10:26</a>, "A fire that is not kindled shall devour him," says (Moral. xv): "Bodily fire needs bodily fuel in order to become fire; neither can it be except by being kindled, nor live unless it be renewed. On the other hand the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, since it is a bodily fire, and burns in a bodily way the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> cast therein, is neither kindled by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> endeavor, nor kept alive with fuel, but once <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> endures unquenchably; at one and the same time it needs no kindling, and lacks not heat." Therefore it is not of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as the fire that we see.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the everlasting and the corruptible differ <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, since they agree not even in genus, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. x). But this fire of ours is corruptible, whereas the other is everlasting: "Depart from Me, you <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a>, into everlasting fire" (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew 25:41</a>). Therefore they are not of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this fire of ours to give light. But the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> gives no light, hence the saying of <a href="../bible/job018.htm#verse5">Job 18:5</a>: "Shall not the light of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> be extinguished?" Therefore . . . as above.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Topic. i, 6), "every water is of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as every other water." Therefore in like manner every fire is of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as every other fire.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse17">Wisdom 11:17</a>): "By what things a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a> by the same also he is tormented." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the sensible things of this world. Therefore it is just that they should be punished by those same things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in Meteor. iv, 1 fire has other bodies for its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, for the reason that of all the elements it has the greatest power of action. Hence fire is found under two <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>: in its own <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in its own sphere, and in a strange <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, whether of earth, as in burning coal, or of air as in the flame. Under whatever <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> however fire be found, it is always of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, so far as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of fire is concerned, but there may be a difference of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as to the bodies which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of fire. Wherefore flame and burning coal differ specifically, and likewise burning wood and red-hot iron; nor does it signify, as to this particular point, whether they be kindled by force, as in the case of iron, or by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> intrinsic principle, as happens with sulphur. Accordingly it is clear that the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as the fire we have, so far as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of fire is concerned. But whether that fire subsists in its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or if it subsists in a strange <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, what that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> may be, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. And in this way it may differ specifically from the fire we have, considered materially. It has, however, certain properties differing from our fire, for instance that it needs no kindling, nor is kept alive by fuel. But the differences do not argue a difference of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the fire.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking of that fire with regard to its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and not with regard to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This fire of ours is kept alive with fuel, and is kindled by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because it is introduced into a foreign <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by art and force. But that other fire needs no fuel to keep it alive, because either it subsists in its own <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or is in a foreign <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, not by force but by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from an intrinsic principle. Wherefore it is kindled not by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who fashioned its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This is the meaning of the words of Isaias (<a href="../bible/isa030.htm#verse33">30:33</a>): "The breath of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is as a torrent of brimstone kindling it."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even as the bodies of the damned will be of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as now, although now they are corruptible, whereas then they will be incorruptible, both by the ordering of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and on account of the cessation of the heavenly movement, so is it with the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> whereby those bodies will be punished.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> To give light does not belong to fire according to any mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, since in its own <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> it gives no light; wherefore it does not shine in its own sphere according to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>: and in like manner in certain foreign matters it does not shine, as when it is in an opaque earthly <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> such as sulphur. The same happens also when its brightness is obscured by thick smoke. Wherefore that the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> gives no light is not sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of its being of a different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the fire of hell is beneath the earth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this fire is not beneath the earth. For it is said of the damned (<a href="../bible/job018.htm#verse18">Job 18:18</a>), "And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall remove him out of the globe [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'world']." Therefore the fire whereby the damned will be punished is not beneath the earth but outside the globe.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> can be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">everlasting</a>. But this fire will be in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> for ever. Therefore it will be there, not by force but <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Now fire cannot be under the earth save by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Therefore the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is not beneath the earth.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a> the bodies of all the damned will be tormented in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Now those bodies will fill a place. Consequently, since the multitude of the damned will be exceeding great, for "the number of fools is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>" (<a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse15">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>), the space containing that fire must also be exceeding great. But it would seem unreasonable to say that there is so great a hollow within the earth, since all the parts of the earth <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> tend to the center. Therefore that fire will not be beneath the earth.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, "By what things a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a>, by the same also he is tormented" (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse17">Wisdom 11:17</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> on the earth. Therefore the fire that punishes them should not be under the earth.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse9">Isaiah 14:9</a>): "<a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a> below was in an uproar to meet Thee at Thy coming." Therefore the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is beneath us.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. iv): "I see not what hinders us from <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is beneath the earth."

<p>Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/jon002.htm#verse4">Jonah 2:4</a>, "Thou hast cast me forth . . . into the heart of the sea," says, "i.e. into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>," and in the Gospel (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse40">Matthew 12:40</a>) the words "in the heart of the earth" have the same sense, for as the heart is in the middle of an animal, so is <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> supposed to be in the middle of the earth.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xv, 16), "I am of opinion that no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> in what part of the world <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is situated, unless the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> has <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> this to some one." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Dial. iv) having been questioned on this point answers: "About this matter I dare not give a rash decision. For some have deemed <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> to be in some part of the earth's surface; others think it to be beneath the earth." He shows the latter opinion to be the more probable for two reasons. First from the very meaning of the word. These are his words: "If we call it the nether regions (infernus [The Latin for '<a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>']), for the reason that it is beneath us [inferius], what earth is in relation to heaven, such should be <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> in relation to earth." Secondly, from the words of <a href="../bible/rev005.htm#verse3">Revelation 5:3</a>: "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was able, neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth, to open the book": where the words "in heaven" refer to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, "on earth" to men living in the body, and "under the earth" to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> too (Gen. ad lit. xii, 34) seems to indicate two reasons for the congruity of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> being under the earth. One is that "whereas the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> through love of the flesh, they should be treated as the dead flesh is wont to be treated, by being buried beneath the earth." The other is that heaviness is to the body what sorrow is to the spirit, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> (of spirit) is as lightness (of body). Wherefore "just as in reference to the body, all the heavier things are beneath the others, if they be placed in order of gravity, so in reference to the spirit, the lower place is occupied by whatever is more sorrowful"; and thus even as the empyrean is a fitting place for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the elect, so the lowest part of the earth is a fitting place for the sorrow of the damned. Nor does it signify that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xv, 16) says that "<a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is stated or believed to be under the earth," because he withdraws this (Retract. ii, 29) where he says: "Methinks I should have said that <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is beneath the earth, rather than have given the reason why it is stated or believed to be under the earth." However, some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have maintained that <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is situated beneath the terrestrial orb, but above the surface of the earth, on that part which is opposite to us. This seems to have been the meaning of <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> when he asserted that "the sun and the moon will stop in the place wherein they were created, lest the wicked should enjoy this light in the midst of their torments." But this is no argument, if we assert that <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is under the earth. We have already stated how these words may be explained (91, 2).

<p><a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoras</a> held the place of punishment to be in a fiery sphere situated, according to him, in the middle of the whole world: and he called it the prison-house of Jupiter as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> relates (De Coelo et Mundo ii). It is, however, more in keeping with <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> to say that it is beneath the earth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words of Job, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall remove him out of the globe," refer to the surface of the earth ["De orbe terrarum," which might be rendered "from the land of the living."], i.e. from this world. This is how <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> expounds it (<a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">Moral</a>. xiv) where he says: "He is removed from the globe when, at the coming of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">heavenly judge</a>, he is taken away from this world wherein he now prides himself in his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>." Nor does <em>globe</em> here signify the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, as though the place of punishment were outside the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fire continues in that place for all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> by the ordering of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> although according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> an element cannot last for ever outside its own place, especially if things were to remain in this state of generation and corruption. The fire there will be of the very greatest heat, because its heat will be all gathered together from all parts, through being surrounded on all sides by the cold of the earth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a> will never lack sufficient room to admit the bodies of the damned: since <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is accounted one of the three things that "never are satisfied" (<a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse15">Proverbs 30:15-16</a>). Nor is it unreasonable that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power should maintain within the bowels of the earth a hollow great enough to contain all the bodies of the damned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It does not follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that "by what things a man sinneth, by the same also he is tormented," except as regards the principal instruments of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for as much as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body will be punished in both. But it does not follow that a man will be punished in the very place where he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, because the place due to the damned is other from that due to wayfarers. We may also reply that these words refer to the punishments inflicted on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the way: according as each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has its corresponding punishment, since "inordinate love is its own punishment," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Confess. i, 12).
