<h1>Question 97. The temptation of God</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3097.htm#article1"> In what the temptation of God consists</a> <li><a href="../summa/3097.htm#article2"> Is it a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3097.htm#article3"> To what virtue is it opposed?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3097.htm#article4"> Its comparison with other vices</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the temptation of God consists in certain deeds, wherein the expected result is ascribed to the power of God alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not consist in certain <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> wherein the result is expected from the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is tempted by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> so is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> tempted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p>But when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is tempted the result is not always expected from his power. Therefore neither is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> tempted when the result is expected from His power alone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all those who work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by invoking the divine name look for an effect due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power alone. Therefore, if the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> consisted in such like <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, all who work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> would <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems to belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfection that he should put aside <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> aids and put his hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse3">Luke 9:3</a>, "Take nothing for your journey," etc. says: "The Gospel precept points out what is required of him that announces the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, namely, that he should not depend on worldly assistance, and that, taking assurance from his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he should hold himself to be the more able to provide for himself, the less he seeks these things." And the Blessed Agatha said: "I have never treated my body with bodily medicine, I have my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Who restores all things by His mere word." [Office of <a href="../cathen/01203c.htm">St. Agatha</a>, eighth Responsory (Dominican Breviary).] But the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not consist in anything pertaining to perfection. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not consist in such like <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, wherein the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is expected.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xxii, 36): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> who gave <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power by teaching and reproving openly, yet not allowing the rage of His enemies to prevail against Him, nevertheless by fleeing and hiding, instructed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, lest it should dare to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when it has to strive to escape from that which it needs to avoid." From this it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> consists in omitting to do what one can in order to escape from danger, and relying on the assistance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Properly speaking, to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> is to test the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> tempted. Now we put a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to the test by words or by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. By words, that we may find out whether he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what we ask, or whether he can and will grant it: by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, when, by what we do, we probe another's <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, will or power. Either of these may happen in two ways. First, openly, as when one declares oneself a tempter: thus Samson (<a href="../bible/jdg014.htm#verse12">Judges 14:12</a>) proposed a riddle to the Philistines in order to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> them. On the second place it may be done with cunning and by stealth, as the Pharisees tempted Christ, as we read in <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse15">Matthew 22:15, sqq.</a> Again this is sometimes done explicitly, as when anyone intends, by word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, to put some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to the test; and sometimes implicitly, when, to wit, though he does not intend to test a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, yet that which he does or says can seemingly have no other purpose than putting him to a test.

<p>Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> tempts <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes by words, sometimes by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Now we speak with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in words when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. Hence a man tempts <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> explicitly in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> when he asks something of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of probing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, power or will. He tempts <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> explicitly by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> when he intends, by whatever he does, to experiment on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will or wisdom. But He will <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> implicitly, if, though he does not intend to make an experiment on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet he asks for or does something which has no other use than to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Thus when a man wishes his horse to gallop in order to escape from the enemy, this is not giving the horse a trial: but if he make the horse gallop with out any useful purpose, it seems to be nothing else than a trial of the horse's speed; and the same applies to all other things. Accordingly when a man in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> entrusts himself to the divine assistance for some urgent or useful motive, this is not to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/2ch020.htm#verse12">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>): "As we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what to do, we can only turn our eyes to Thee." But if this be done without any useful or urgent motive, this is to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> implicitly. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy 6:16</a>, "Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>," says: "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> tempts <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if having the means at hand, without reason he chooses a dangerous course, trying whether he can be delivered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Man also is sometimes tempted by means of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, to test his ability or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or will to uphold or oppose those same <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, they are moved by a motive of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> or usefulness to ask for that which is an effect of the divine power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The preachers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> kingdom dispense with temporal aids, so as to be freer to give their time to the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore if they depend on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, it does not follow that they <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if they were to neglect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> assistance without any useful or urgent motive, they would be <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Faust. xxii, 36) says that "<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> fled, not through ceasing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but lest he should <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were he not to flee when he had the means of flight." The Blessed Agatha had experience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> kindness towards her, so that either she did not suffer such sickness as required bodily medicine, or else she felt herself suddenly cured by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is a sin to tempt God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not commanded <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet He has commanded men to try, which is the same as to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a>, Him: for it is written (<a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse10">Malachi 3:10</a>): "Bring all the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> into the storehouse, that there may be meat in My house; and try Me in this, saith the Lord, if I open not unto you the flood-gates of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Therefore it seems not to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man is tempted not only in order to test his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and his power, but also to try his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or his will. Now it is lawful to test the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or will, for it is written (<a href="../bible/psa033.htm#verse9">Psalm 33:9</a>): "O taste and see that the Lord is sweet," and (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse2">Romans 12:2</a>): "That you may <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> what is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the acceptable, and the perfect will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> never blames a man for ceasing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but rather for committing a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now Achaz is blamed because when the Lord said: "Ask thee a sign of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>," he replied: "I will not ask, and I will not <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> the Lord," and then it was said to him: "Is it a small thing for you to be grievous to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that you are grievous to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also?" (<a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse11">Isaiah 7:11-13</a>). And we read of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> (<a href="../bible/gen015.htm#verse8">Genesis 15:8</a>) that he said to the Lord: "Whereby may I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I shall possess it?" namely, the land which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had promised him. Again Gedeon asked <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for a sign of the victory promised to him (<a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#verse36">Judges 6:36, sqq.</a>). Yet they were not blamed for so doing. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is forbidden in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Law, for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 6:10</a>): "Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is to put him to a test. Now one never tests that of which one is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>. Wherefore all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> proceeds from some <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, either in the tempter (as when one tests a thing in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>), or in others (as when one tests a thing in order to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> it to others), and in this latter way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> us. Now it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of or to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that which pertains to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> perfection. Wherefore it is evident that it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in order that the tempter himself may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power.

<p>On the other hand, if one were to test that which pertains to the divine perfection, not in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it oneself, but to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> it to others: this is not <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, provided there be just motive of urgency, or a pious motive of usefulness, and other requisite <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. For thus did the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> ask the Lord that signs might be wrought in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as related in <a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse30">Acts 4:30</a>, in order, to wit, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power might be made manifest to unbelievers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The paying of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> was prescribed in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, as stated above (Question 87, Article 1). Hence there was a motive of urgency to pay it, through the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, and also a motive of usefulness, as stated in the text quoted--"that there may be meat in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> house": wherefore they did not <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by paying <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. The words that follow, "and try Me," are not to be understood <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causally</a>, as though they had to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in order to try if "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would open the flood-gates of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," but consecutively, because, to wit, if they paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, they would <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> by experience the favors which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would shower upon them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There is a twofold <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or will. One is speculative and as to this it is not lawful to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> whether <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or whether <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is sweet. The other <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is effective or experimental and thereby a man experiences in himself the taste of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sweetness, and complacency in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says of Hierotheos (Div. Nom. ii) that "he learnt divine thing through experience of them." It is in this way that we are told to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, and to taste His sweetness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wished to give a sign to Achaz, not for him alone, but for the instruction of the whole people. Hence he was reproved because, by refusing to ask a sign, he was an obstacle to the common welfare. Nor would he have tempted <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by asking, both because he would have asked through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commanding him to do so, and because it was a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> relating to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> asked for a sign through the divine <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, and so he did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Gedeon seems to have asked a sign through weakness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, wherefore he is not to be excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes: just as Zachary <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in saying to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse18">Luke 1:18</a>): "Whereby shall I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this?" so that he was punished for his unbelief.

<p>It must be observed, however, that there are two ways of asking <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for a sign: first in order to test <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power or the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His word, and this of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Secondly, in order to be instructed as to what is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> pleasure in some particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and this nowise comes under the head of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether temptation of God is opposed to the virtue of religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of religion. The <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, because a man <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> comes under the head of unbelief, which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rather than to religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/sir018.htm#verse23">Sirach 18:23</a>): "Before <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> prepare thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and be not as a man that tempteth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Such a man," that is, who tempts <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, says the interlinear <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> taught him to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for, yet does not what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has commanded him to do." Now this pertains to imprudence which is opposed to hope. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> opposed to hope.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse18">Psalm 77:18</a>, "And they tempted <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in their hearts," says that "to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to Him deceitfully, with simplicity in our words and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in our hearts." Now deceit is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is opposed, not to religion, but to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> quoted above "to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to Him inordinately." Now to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> becomingly is an act of religion as stated above (Question 83, Article 15). Therefore to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> opposed to religion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As clearly shown above (Question 81, Article 5), the end of religion is to pay reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore whatever pertains directly to irreverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is opposed to religion. Now it is evident that to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> pertains to irreverence for him: since no one presumes to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> one of whose excellence he is sure. Hence it is manifest that to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> opposed to religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (Question 81, Article 07), it belongs to religion to declare one's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by certain signs indicative of reverence towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently it belongs to irreligion that, through <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a man does things indicative of irreverence towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one of these; wherefore it is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of irreligion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He that prepares not his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> before <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by forgiving those against whom he has anything, or in some other way disposing himself to devotion, does not do what he can to be heard by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherefore he tempts <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> implicitly as it were. And though this implicit <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> would seem to arise from presumption or indiscretion, yet the very fact that a man behaves presumptuously and without due care in matters relating to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> implies irreverence towards Him. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse6">1 Peter 5:6</a>): "Be you <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> . . . under the mighty hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse15">2 Timothy 2:15</a>): "Carefully study to present thyself approved unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore also this kind of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of irreligion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> deceitfully, not in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the secrets of the heart, but in relation to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore deceit is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and consequently it does not follow that to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is directly opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the temptation of God is a graver sin than superstition?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. The greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> receives the greater punishment. Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was more severely punished in the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> than was the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; and yet the latter is the chief form of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>: since for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> three thousand men of their number were slain, as related in <a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse28">Exodus 32:28</a> [<a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint version</a>]. The <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> has "twenty-three thousand."], whereas for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> they all without exception perished in the desert, and entered not into the land of promise, according to <a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse9">Psalm 94:9</a>, "Your fathers tempted Me," and further on, "so I swore in My wrath that they should not enter into My rest." Therefore to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> the graver it would seem to be. Now irreligion, of which the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is more opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of religion, than superstition which bears some likeness to religion. Therefore to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems to be a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to behave disrespectfully to one's parents, than to pay others the respect we owe to our parents. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by us as the Father of all (<a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse6">Malachi 1:6</a>). Therefore. <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whereby we behave irreverently to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seems to be a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, whereby we give to a creature the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> we owe to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 17:2</a>, "When there shall be found among you," etc. says: "The Law detests <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> above all: for it is a very great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to give to a creature the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> that belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Among <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> opposed to religion, the more grievous is that which is the more opposed to the reverence due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now it is less opposed to this reverence that one should <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the divine excellence than that one should hold the contrary for certain. For just as a man is more of an unbeliever if he be confirmed in his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, than if he <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so, too, a man acts more against the reverence due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if by his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> he professes an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> contrary to the divine excellence, than if he expresses a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> professes an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, as shown above (94, 1, ad 1), whereas he who tempts <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> expresses a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of the divine excellence, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of superstition is graver than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> was not punished in the above manner, as though it were a sufficient punishment; because a more severe punishment was reserved in the future for that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse34">Exodus 32:34</a>): "And I, in the day of revenge, will visit this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also of theirs."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Superstition bears a likeness to religion, as regards the material act which it pays just as religion does. But, as regards the end, it is more contrary to religion than the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it implies greater irreverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It belongs <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to the divine excellence that it is singular and incommunicable. Consequently to give divine reverence to another is the same as to do a thing opposed to the divine excellence. There is no comparison with the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to our parents, which can without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be given to others.
