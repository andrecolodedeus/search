<h1>Question 98. Perjury</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3098.htm#article1"> Is falsehood necessary for perjury?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3098.htm#article2"> Is perjury always a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3098.htm#article3"> Is it always a mortal sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3098.htm#article4"> Is it a sin to enjoin an oath on a perjurer?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is necessary for perjury that the statement confirmed on oath be false?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for perjury that the statement confirmed on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. As stated above (Question 89, Article 3), an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> should be accompanied by judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> no less than by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Since therefore perjury is incurred through lack of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it is incurred likewise through lack of judgment, as when one swears indiscreetly, and through lack of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as when one swears to something <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which confirms is more weighty than the thing confirmed thereby: thus in a syllogism the premises are more weighty than the conclusion. Now in an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> a man's statement is confirmed by calling on the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore perjury seems to consist in swearing by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods rather than in a lack of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> statement which is confirmed on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Apost. Jacobi; Serm. clxxx): "Men swear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> both in deceiving others and when they are deceived themselves"; and he gives three examples. The first is: "Supposing a man to swear, thinking that what he swears to is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whereas it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>"; the second is: "Take the instance of another who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the statement to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, and swears to it as though it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>"; and the third is: "Take another, who thinks his statement <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, and swears to its being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, while perhaps it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>," of whom he says afterwards that he is a perjurer. Therefore one may be a perjurer while swearing to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore falsehood is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for perjury.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Perjury is defined "a falsehood confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>" [<a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>, Sum. Sent. iv, 5.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 92, Article 2), moral acts take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their end. Now the end of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is the confirmation of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> assertion. To this confirmation falsehood is opposed: since an assertion is confirmed by being firmly shown to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and this cannot happen to that which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Hence falsehood directly annuls the end of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: and for this reason, that perversity in swearing, which is called perjury, takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> chiefly from falsehood. Consequently falsehood is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to perjury.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/jer004.htm#verse2">Jeremiah 4:2</a>, "whichever of these three be lacking, there is perjury," but in different order. For first and chiefly perjury consists in a lack of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for the reason stated in the Article. Secondly, there is perjury when <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is lacking, for in whatever way a man swears to that which is unlawful, for this very reason he is guilty of falsehood, since he is under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to do the contrary. Thirdly, there is perjury when judgment is lacking, since by the very fact that a man swears indiscreetly, he incurs the danger of lapsing into falsehood.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In syllogisms the premises are of greater weight, since they are in the position of active principle, as stated in Phys. ii, 3: whereas in moral matters the end is of greater importance than the active principle. Hence though it is a perverse <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> when a man swears to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods, yet perjury takes its name from that kind of perversity in an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, that deprives the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of its end, by swearing what is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Moral acts proceed from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whose object is the apprehended <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore if the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> be apprehended as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it will be materially <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, but formally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as related to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. If something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> be apprehended as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, it will be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> both materially and formally. If that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> be apprehended as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, it will be materially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and formally <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Hence in each of these cases the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> required for perjury are to be found in some way, on account of some measure of falsehood. Since, however, that which is formal in anything is of greater importance than that which is material, he that swears to a falsehood thinking it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is not so much of a perjurer as he that swears to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> thinking it <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Apost. Jacobi; Serm. clxxx): "It depends how the assertion proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, for the tongue is not guilty except the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> be guilty."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether all perjury is sinful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not all perjury is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Whoever does not fulfil what he has confirmed on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is seemingly a perjurer. Yet sometimes a man swears he will do something unlawful (<a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, for instance, or <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>): and if he does it, he commits a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If therefore he would commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> even if he did it not, it would follow that he is perplexed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by doing what is best. Yet sometimes by committing a perjury one does what is best: as when a man swears not to enter religion, or not to do some kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Therefore not all perjury is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, he that swears to do another's will would seem to be guilty of perjury unless he do it. Yet it may happen sometimes that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not, if he do not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will: for instance, if the latter order him to do something too hard and unbearable. Therefore seemingly not all perjury is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a promissory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> extends to future, just as a declaratory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> extends to past and present things. Now the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> may be removed by some future occurrence: thus a state may swear to fulfil some <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and afterwards other citizens come on the scene who did not take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; or a canon may swear to keep the statutes of a certain church, and afterwards new statutes are made. Therefore seemingly he that breaks an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Apost. Jacobi; Serm. cxxx), in speaking of perjury: "See how you should detest this horrible beast and exterminate it from all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> business."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 89, Article 1), to swear is to call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as witness. Now it is an irreverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to call Him to witness to a falsehood, because by so doing one implies either that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ignores the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or that He is willing to bear witness to a falsehood. Therefore perjury is manifestly a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> opposed to religion, to which it belongs to show reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He that swears to do what is unlawful is thereby guilty of perjury through lack of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: though, if he fails to keep his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, he is not guilty of perjury in this respect, since that which he swore to do was not a fit <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who swears not to enter religion, or not to give an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, or the like, is guilty of perjury through lack of judgment. Hence when he does that which is best it is not an act of perjury, but contrary thereto: for the contrary of that which he is doing could not be a matter of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> swears or promises to do another's will, there is to be understood this requisite <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>--that the thing commanded be lawful and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, and not unbearable or immoderate.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is a personal act, and so when a man becomes a citizen of a state, he is not bound, as by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, to fulfil whatever the state has sworn to do. Yet he is bound by a kind of fidelity, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of which <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is that he should take his share of the state's burdens if he takes a share of its goods.

<p>The canon who swears to keep the statutes that have force in some particular "college" is not bound by his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to keep any that may be made in the future, unless he intends to bind himself to keep all, past and future. Nevertheless he is bound to keep them by virtue of the statutes themselves, since they are possessed of coercive force, as stated above (I-II, 96, 4).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether all perjury is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not all perjury is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It is laid down (Extra, De Jurejur, cap. Verum): "Referring to the question whether an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is binding on those who have taken one in order to safeguard their life and possessions, we have no other mind than that which our predecessors the Roman Pontiffs are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have had, and who <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Henceforth, that discretion may be observed, and in order to avoid occasions of perjury, let them not be told expressly not to keep their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: but if they should not keep it, they are not for this reason to be punished as for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore not all perjury is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xliv in the Opus Imperfectum on St. Matthew, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] says, "it is a greater thing to swear by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>." Now it is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to swear by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; for instance, if we were to employ such an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in fun or by a slip of the tongue in the course of an ordinary conversation. Therefore neither is it always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to break an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that has been taken solemnly on the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> a man incurs infamy through committing perjury (VI, qu. i, cap. Onfames). Now it would seem that infamy is not incurred through any kind of perjury, as it is prescribed in the case of a declaratory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> violated by perjury [Cap. Cum dilectus, de Ord. Cognit.]. Therefore, seemingly, not all perjury is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is contrary to a divine precept is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now perjury is contrary to a divine precept, for it is written (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse12">Leviticus 19:12</a>): "Thou shalt not swear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> by My name." Therefore it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Poster. i, 2), "that which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a thing to be such is yet more so." Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that an action which is, by reason of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or even a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> action, is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if it be done out of contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore any action that of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, implies contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now perjury, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> implies contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the reason why it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> is because it is an act of irreverence towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it is manifest that perjury, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (89, 07, ad 3), coercion does not deprive a promissory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of its binding force, as regards that which can be done lawfully. Wherefore he who fails to fulfil an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which he took under coercion is guilty of perjury and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> can, by his authority, <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> a man from an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> even of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, especially if the latter should have been coerced into taking the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> through such fear as may overcome a high-principled <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>When, however, it is said that these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not to be punished as for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this does not mean that they are not guilty of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that a lesser punishment is to be inflicted on them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He that swears <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> in fun is nonetheless irreverent to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, indeed, in a way, he is more so, and consequently is not excused from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He that swears <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> by a slip of tongue, if he adverts to the fact that he is swearing, and that he is swearing to something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, is not excused from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as neither is he excused from contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If, however, he does not advert to this, he would seem to have no <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of swearing, and consequently is excused from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of perjury.

<p>It is, however, a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to swear solemnly by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, than to swear by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in ordinary conversation, both on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> and on account of the greater deliberation. But if we consider them equally in comparison with one another, it is more grievous to commit perjury in swearing by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than in swearing by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> makes a man infamous in the eye of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Wherefore, if a man who has sworn <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> in a declaratory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> be not infamous in the eye of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but only when he has been so declared by sentence in a court of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, it does not follow that he has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> mortally. The reason why the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> attaches infamy rather to one who breaks a promissory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> taken solemnly is that he still has it in his power after he has sworn to substantiate his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, which is not the case in a declaratory <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether he sins who demands an oath of a perjurer?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that he who demands an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of a perjurer commits a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Either he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he swears <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, or he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he swears <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>. If he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> him to swear <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, it is useless for him to demand an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: and if he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> him to swear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, for his own part he leads him into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore nowise seemingly should one enjoin an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> on another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to receive an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> from a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is less than to impose an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> on him. Now it would seem unlawful to receive an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> from a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, especially if he swear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, because he would then seem to consent in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Much less therefore would it seem lawful to impose an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> on one who swears <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/lev005.htm#verse1">Leviticus 5:1</a>): "If anyone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and hear the voice of one swearing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ['Falsely' is not in the Vulgate'], and is a witness either because he himself hath seen, or is privy to it: if he do not utter it, he shall bear his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>." Hence it would seem that when a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> another to be swearing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, he is bound to denounce him. Therefore it is not lawful to demand an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of such a man.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> On the other hand, Just as it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to swear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so is it to swear by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods. Yet it is lawful to take advantage of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of one who has sworn by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad Public. Ep. xlvii). Therefore it is lawful to demand an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> from one who swears <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As regards a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who demands an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> from another, a distinction would seem to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. For either he demands the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> on his own account and of his own accord, or he demands it on account of the exigencies of a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> imposed on him. If a man demands an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> on his own account as a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, we must make a distinction, as does <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (de Perjuriis. serm. clxxx): "For if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will swear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, and says to him accordingly: 'Swear to me' in order that he may be credited, there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: yet it is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>" (because, to wit, it proceeds from his weakness in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubting</a> whether the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>). "This is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> whereof <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse37">Matthew 5:37</a>): That which is over and above these, is of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have done so," i.e. the contrary of what he swears to, "and yet forces him to swear, he is a murderer: for the other destroys himself by his perjury, but it is he who urged the hand of the slayer."

<p>If, on the other hand, a man demands an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> as a public <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, in accordance with the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, on the requisition of a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: he does not seem to be at fault, if he demands an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, whether he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he will swear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, because seemingly it is not he that exacts the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> but the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> at whose instance he demands it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument avails in the case of one who demands an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> on his own account. Yet he does not always <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the other will swear <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, for at times he has <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> about the fact, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> he will swear <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>. On such a case he exacts an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in order that he may be more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad Public. serm. xlvii), "though we are forbidden to swear, I do not remember ever to have read in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> that we must not accept oaths from others." Hence he that accepts an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except perchance when of his own accord he forces another to swear, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he will swear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. Super Lev, qu. i), <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the passage quoted did not state to whom one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had to denounce another's perjury: wherefore it must be understood that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> had to be denounced "to those who would do the perjurer <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> rather than harm." Again, neither did he state in what order the denunciation was to be made: wherefore seemingly the Gospel order should be followed, if the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of perjury should be hidden, especially when it does not tend to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> injury: because if it did, the Gospel order would not apply to the case, as stated above (33, 07; 68, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It is lawful to make use of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does, but it is not lawful to lead anyone to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Consequently it is lawful to accept the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of one who is ready to swear by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods, but it is not lawful to induce him to swear by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods. Yet it seems to be different in the case of one who swears <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of this kind lacks the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which a man makes use of in the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of one who swears <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad Public. Ep. xlvii). Hence when a man swears <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> seems to lack any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that one may use lawfully.
