<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the Old Law was good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/eze020.htm#verse25">Ezekiel 20:25</a>): "I gave them statutes that were not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and judgments in which they shall not live." But a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> except on account of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the precepts that it contains. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that it conduce to the common welfare, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 3). But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not salutary; rather was it deadly and hurtful. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse8">Romans 7:8, seqq.</a>): "Without the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was dead. And I lived some time without the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But when the commandment came <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> revived; and I died." Again he says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans 5:20</a>): "Law entered in that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might abound." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that it should be possible to obey it, both according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> custom. But such the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not: since <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse10">Acts 15:10</a>): "Why <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> you (<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>) to put a yoke on the necks of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?" Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse12">Romans 7:12</a>): "Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> indeed is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and the commandment <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For just as a doctrine is shown to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by the fact that it accords with right reason, so is a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> if it accords with reason. Now the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was in accordance with reason. Because it repressed <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> which is in conflict with reason, as evidenced by the commandment, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods" (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse17">Exodus 20:17</a>). Moreover the same <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> forbade all kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and these too are contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Consequently it is evident that it was a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> argues in the same way (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm">Romans 7</a>): "I am delighted," says he (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse22">verse 22</a>), "with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the inward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>": and again (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse16">verse 16</a>): "I consent to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p>But it must be noted that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has various degrees, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv): for there is a perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and an imperfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. In things ordained to an end, there is perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> when a thing is such that it is sufficient in itself to conduce to the end: while there is imperfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> when a thing is of some assistance in attaining the end, but is not sufficient for the realization thereof. Thus a medicine is perfectly <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if it gives health to a man; but it is imperfect, if it helps to cure him, without being able to bring him back to health. Again it must be observed that the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is different from the end of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. For the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is the temporal tranquillity of the state, which end <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> effects by directing external actions, as regards those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which might disturb the peaceful <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the state. On the other hand, the end of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> is to bring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to that end which is everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; which end is hindered by any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not only of external, but also of internal action. Consequently that which suffices for the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, viz. the prohibition and punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, does not suffice for the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>: but it is requisite that it should make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> altogether fit to partake of everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Now this cannot be done save by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, whereby "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>" which fulfilleth the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> . . . "is spread abroad in our hearts" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>): since "the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is life everlasting" (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> could not confer this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for this was reserved to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; because, as it is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John 1:17</a>), the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was given "by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." Consequently the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> indeed, but imperfect, according to <a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse19">Hebrews 7:19</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> brought nothing to perfection."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Lord refers there to the ceremonial precepts; which are said not to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because they did not confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unto the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, although by fulfilling these precepts <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> confessed himself a sinner. Hence it is said pointedly, "and judgments in which they shall not live"; i.e. whereby they are unable to obtain life; and so the text goes on: "And I polluted them," i.e. showed them to be polluted, "in their own <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, when they offered all that opened the womb, for their offenses."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is said to have been deadly, as being not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but the occasion of death, on account of its imperfection: in so far as it did not confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> enabling <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to fulfil what is prescribed, and to avoid what it forbade. Hence this occasion was not given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but taken by them. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse11">Romans 5:11</a>): "Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduced</a> me, and by it killed me." In the same sense when it is said that "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> entered in that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might abound," the conjunction "that" must be taken as consecutive and not final: in so far as men, taking occasion from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> all the more, both because a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> became more grievous after <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> had forbidden it, and because <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> increased, since we desire a thing the more from its being forbidden.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The yoke of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> could not be borne without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> did not confer: for it is written (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse16">Romans 9:16</a>): "It is not him that willeth, nor of him that runneth," viz. that he wills and runs in the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that showeth mercy." Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse32">Psalm 118:32</a>): "I have run the way of Thy commandments, when Thou didst enlarge my heart," i.e. by giving me <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the Old Law was from God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>): "The works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are perfect." But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was imperfect, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc003.htm#verse14">Ecclesiastes 3:14</a>): "I have learned that all the works which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath made continue for ever." But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> does not continue for ever: since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse18">Hebrews 7:18</a>): "There is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment, because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a wise lawgiver should remove, not only <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but also the occasions of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was an occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (1, ad 2). Therefore the giving of such a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom "none is like among the lawgivers" (<a href="../bible/job036.htm#verse22">Job 36:22</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 2:4</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved." But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did not suffice to save <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore the giving of such a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> did not appertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse6">Matthew 15:6</a>) while speaking to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, to whom the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was given: "You have made void the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for your tradition." And shortly before (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse4">verse 4</a>) He had said: "Honor thy father and mother," which is contained expressly in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse12">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy 5:16</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was given by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> ordained men to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in two ways. First by bearing witness to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; wherefore He Himself says (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse44">Luke 24:44</a>): "All things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> . . . and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and in the psalms, concerning Me": and (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse46">John 5:46</a>): "If you did <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would perhaps <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me also; for he wrote of Me." Secondly, as a kind of disposition, since by withdrawing men from idolatrous worship, it enclosed [concludebat] them in the worship of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by Whom the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> was to be saved through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse23">Galatians 3:23</a>): "Before the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> came, we were kept under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> shut up [conclusi], unto that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was to be revealed." Now it is evident that the same thing it is, which gives a disposition to the end, and which brings to the end; and when I say "the same," I mean that it does so either by itself or through its subjects. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> would not make a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> whereby men would be led to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who was to cast him out, according to <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse26">Matthew 12:26</a>: "If Satan cast out Satan, his kingdom is divided" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'he is divided against himself']. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was given by the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whom came <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Nothing prevents a thing being not perfect simply, and yet perfect in respect of time: thus a boy is said to be perfect, not simply, but with regard to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. So, too, precepts that are given to children are perfect in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of those to whom they are given, although they are not perfect simply. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse24">Galatians 3:24</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was our pedagogue in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> endure for ever which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so made that they would endure for ever; and these are His perfect works. But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was set aside when there came the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; not as though it were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but as being weak and useless for this time; because, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> goes on to say, "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> brought nothing to perfection": hence he says (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse25">Galatians 3:25</a>): "After the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 79, Article 4), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes permits certain ones to fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that they may thereby be humbled. So also did He wish to give such a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> as men by their own forces could not fulfill, so that, while presuming on their own powers, they might find themselves to be sinners, and being <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> might have recourse to the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did not suffice to save <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, yet another help from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> besides the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was available for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Mediator, by which the fathers of old were justified even as we were. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not fail <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by giving him insufficient aids to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the Old Law was given through the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not given through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> means a "messenger"; so that the word "angel" denotes ministry, not lordship, according to <a href="../bible/psa102.htm#verse20">Psalm 102:20-21</a>: "Bless the Lord, all ye His Angels . . . you ministers of His." But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> is related to have been given by the Lord: for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse1">Exodus 20:1</a>): "And the Lord spoke . . . these words," and further on: "I am the Lord Thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Moreover the same expression is often repeated in Exodus, and the later books of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John 1:17</a>, "the Law was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>." But <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> received it from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately: for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse11">Exodus 33:11</a>): "The Lord spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> face to face, as a man is wont to speak to his friend." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to the sovereign alone to make a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (Question 90, Article 3). But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is Sovereign as regards the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: while the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are the "ministering spirits," as stated in <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse14">Hebrews 1:14</a>. Therefore it was not meet for the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to be given through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, since it is ordained to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> said (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse19">Galatians 3:19</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was "given [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'ordained'] by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the hand of a Mediator." And <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">Stephen</a> said (<a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse53">Acts 7:53</a>): "(Who) have received the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> by the disposition of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Law was given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And besides the general reason given by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. iv), viz. that "the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be brought to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by means of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>," there is a special reason why the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> should have been given through them. For it has been stated (1,2) that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was imperfect, and yet disposed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to that perfect <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, which was to come through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now it is to be observed that wherever there is an order of powers or arts, he that holds the highest place, himself exercises the principal and perfect acts; while those things which dispose to the ultimate perfection are effected by him through his subordinates: thus the ship-builder himself rivets the planks together, but prepares the material by means of the workmen who assist him under his direction. Consequently it was fitting that the perfect <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> should be given by the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately; but that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> should be given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by the ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, i.e. by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. It is thus that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> at the beginning of his epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse2">1:2</a>) proves the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> over the Old; because in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . hath spoken to us by His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>," whereas in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> "the word was spoken by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>" (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse2">Hebrews 2:2</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says at the beginning of his Morals (Praef. chap. i), "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who is described to have appeared to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, is sometimes mentioned as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, sometimes as the Lord: an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in respect of that which was subservient to the external delivery; and the Lord, because He was the Director within, Who supported the effectual power of speaking." Hence also it is that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> spoke as personating the Lord.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 27), it is stated in Exodus that "the Lord spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> face to face"; and shortly afterwards we read, "Show me Thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore He perceived what he saw and he desired what he saw not." Hence he did not see the very Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and consequently he was not taught by Him immediately. Accordingly when <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> states that "He spoke to him face to face," this is to be understood as expressing the opinion of the people, who thought that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was speaking with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> mouth to mouth, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spoke and appeared to him, by means of a subordinate creature, i.e. an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and a cloud. Again we may say that this vision "face to face" means some kind of sublime and familiar <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, inferior to the vision of the Divine Essence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is for the sovereign alone to make a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> by his own authority; but sometimes after making a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, he promulgates it through others. Thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> by His own authority, but He promulgated it through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the Old Law should have been given to the Jews alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> should not have been given to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> alone. For the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> disposed men for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which was to come through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as stated above (2,3). But that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was to come not to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> alone but to all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse6">Isaiah 49:6</a>: "It is a small thing that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, and to convert the dregs of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Behold I have given thee to be the light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that thou mayest be My <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, even to the farthest part of the earth." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> should have been given to all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and not to one people only.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse34">Acts 10:34-35</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: but in every nation, he that feareth Him, and worketh <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, is acceptable to Him." Therefore the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> should not have been opened to one people more than to another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was given through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> always vouchsafed the ministrations of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> not to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> alone, but to all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir017.htm#verse14">Sirach 17:14</a>): "Over every nation He set a ruler." Also on all nations He bestows temporal goods, which are of less account with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods. Therefore He should have given the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> also to all peoples.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse1">Romans 3:1-2</a>): "What advantage then hath the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>? . . . Much every way. First indeed, because the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were committed to them": and (<a href="../bible/psa147.htm#verse9">Psalm 147:9</a>): "He hath not done in like manner to every nation: and His judgments He hath not made manifest unto them."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It might be assigned as a reason for the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> being given to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> rather than to other peoples, that the Jewish people alone remained faithful to the worship of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the others turned away to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; wherefore the latter were unworthy to receive the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, lest a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing should be given to dogs.

<p>But this reason does not seem fitting: because that people turned to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, even after the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> had been made, which was more grievous, as is clear from <a href="../bible/exo032.htm">Exodus 32</a> and from <a href="../bible/amo005.htm#verse25">Amos 5:25-26</a>: "Did you offer victims and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to Me in the desert for forty years, O house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? But you carried a tabernacle for your Moloch, and the image of your <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves." Moreover it is stated expressly (<a href="../bible/deu009.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> therefore that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> giveth thee not this excellent land in possession for thy justices, for thou art a very stiff-necked people": but the real reason is given in the preceding verse: "That the Lord might accomplish His word, which He promised by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to thy fathers <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>."

<p>What this promise was is shown by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, who says (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse16">Galatians 3:16</a>) that "to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not, 'And to his seeds,' as of many: but as of one, 'And to thy seed,' which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." And so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> vouchsafed both the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> and other special boons to that people, on account of the promised made to their fathers that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be born of them. For it was fitting that the people, of whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to be born, should be signalized by a special sanctification, according to the words of <a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse2">Leviticus 19:2</a>: "Be ye <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, because I . . . am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>." Nor again was it on account of the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> himself that this promise was made to him, viz. that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be born of his seed: but of gratuitous election and vocation. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/isa041.htm#verse2">Isaiah 41:2</a>): "Who hath raised up the just one form the east, hath called him to follow him?"

<p>It is therefore evident that it was merely from gratuitous election that the patriarchs received the promise, and that the people sprung from them received the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; according to <a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse36">Deuteronomy 4:36-37</a>: "Ye did [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Thou didst'] hear His words out of the midst of the fire, because He loved thy fathers, and chose their seed after them." And if again it asked why He chose this people, and not another, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> might be born thereof; a fitting answer is given by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. super Joan. xxvi): "Why He draweth one and draweth not another, seek not thou to judge, if thou wish not to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which was to come through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, was prepared for all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, yet it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be born of one people, which, for this reason, was privileged above other peoples; according to <a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse4">Romans 9:4</a>: "To whom," namely the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, "belongeth the adoption as of children (of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>) . . . and the testament, and the giving of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> . . . whose are the fathers, and of whom is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to the flesh."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> takes place in those things which are given according to due; but it has no place in those things which are bestowed gratuitously. Because he who, out of generosity, gives of his own to one and not to another, is not a respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: but if he were a dispenser of goods held in common, and were not to distribute them according to personal <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, he would be a respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bestows the benefits of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> gratuitously: wherefore He is not a respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, if He gives them to some rather than to others. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praedest. Sanct. viii): "All whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> teaches, he teaches out of pity; but whom He teaches not, out of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> He teaches not": for this is due to the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The benefits of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are forfeited by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but not the benefits of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Among the latter are the ministries of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which the very order of various natures demands, viz. that the lowest beings be governed through the intermediate beings: and also bodily aids, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> vouchsafes not only to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but also to beasts, according to <a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse7">Psalm 35:7</a>: "Men and beasts Thou wilt preserve, O Lord."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether all men were bound to observe the Old Law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were bound to observe the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Because whoever is subject to the king, must needs be subject to his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is "King of all the earth" (<a href="../bible/psa046.htm#verse8">Psalm 46:8</a>). Therefore all the inhabitants of the earth were bound to observe the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> could not be saved without observing the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu027.htm#verse26">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>): "<a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">Cursed</a> be he that abideth not in the words of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and fulfilleth them not in work." If therefore other men could be saved without the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> would be in a worse plight than other men.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were admitted to the Jewish ritual and to the observances of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse48">Exodus 12:48</a>): "If any stranger be willing to dwell among you, and to keep the Phase of the Lord, all his males shall first be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, and then shall he celebrate it according to the manner; and he shall be as he that is born in the land." But it would have been useless to admit strangers to the legal observances according to Divine ordinance, if they could have been saved without the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Therefore none could be saved without observing the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. ix) that many of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were brought back to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> did not observe the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Therefore some could be saved without observing the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> showed forth the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, and added certain precepts of its own. Accordingly, as to those precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> contained in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, all were bound to observe the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>; not because they belonged to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, but because they belonged to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. But as to those precepts which were added by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, they were not binding on save the Jewish people alone.

<p>The reason of this is because the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), was given to the Jewish people, that it might receive a prerogative of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, in reverence for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who was to be born of that people. Now whatever laws are enacted for the special sanctification of certain ones, are binding on them alone: thus <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who are set aside for the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are bound to certain <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> are not bound; likewise religious are bound by their profession to certain works of perfection, to which people living in the world are not bound. In like manner this people was bound to certain special observances, to which other peoples were not bound. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 18:13</a>): "Thou shalt be perfect and without spot before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>": and for this reason they used a kind of form of profession, as appears from <a href="../bible/deu026.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy 26:3</a>: "I profess this day before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Whoever are subject to a king, are bound to observe his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which he makes for all in general. But if he orders certain things to be observed by the servants of his household, others are not bound thereto.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The more a man is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the better his state becomes: wherefore the more the Jewish people were bound to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the greater their excellence over other peoples. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse8">Deuteronomy 4:8</a>): "What other nation is there so renowned that hath ceremonies and just judgments, and all the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>?" In like manner, from this point of view, the state of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> is better than that of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, and the state of religious than that of folk living in the world.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> obtained <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> more perfectly and more securely under the observances of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> than under the mere <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>: and for this reason they were admitted to them. So too the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> are now admitted to the ranks of the clergy, and secular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to those of the religious, although they can be saved without this.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the Old Law was suitably given at the time of Moses?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not suitably given at the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> disposed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which was to come through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as stated above (2,3). But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needed this salutary remedy immediately after he had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> should have been given immediately after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was given for the sanctification of those from whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to be born. Now the promise concerning the "seed, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse16">Galatians 3:16</a>) was first made to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, as related in <a href="../bible/gen012.htm#verse7">Genesis 12:7</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> should have been given at once at the time of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born of those alone who descended from <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> through <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, to whom the promise was made; so was He born of no other of the descendants of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> but David, to whom the promise was renewed, according to <a href="../bible/2sa023.htm#verse1">2 Samuel 23:1</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to whom it was appointed concerning the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> . . . said." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> should have been given after David, just as it was given after <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse19">Galatians 3:19</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> "was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come, to whom He made the promise, being ordained by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the hand of a Mediator": ordained, i.e. "given in orderly fashion," as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains. Therefore it was fitting that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> should be given in this order of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was most fitting for the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to be given at the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. The reason for this may be taken from two things in respect of which every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is imposed on two kinds of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Because it is imposed on some men who are hard-hearted and proud, whom the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> restrains and tames: and it is imposed on <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men, who, through being instructed by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, are helped to fulfil what they desire to do. Hence it was fitting that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> should be given at such a time as would be appropriate for the overcoming of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of two things, viz. of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of power. He was <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as though his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> could suffice him for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: and accordingly, in order that his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> might be overcome in this matter, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was left to the guidance of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> without the help of a written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was able to learn from experience that his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> was deficient, since about the time of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had fallen headlong into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and the most shameful <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Wherefore, after those times, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to be given as a remedy for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: because "by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse20">Romans 3:20</a>). But, after <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had been instructed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> was convinced of his weakness, through his being unable to fulfil what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. Hence, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> concludes (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans 8:3-4</a>), "what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'sending'] His own Son . . . that the justification of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> might be fulfilled in us."

<p>With regard to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was given to them as a help; which was most needed by the people, at the time when the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> began to be obscured on account of the exuberance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for it was fitting that this help should be bestowed on men in an orderly manner, so that they might be led from imperfection to perfection; wherefore it was becoming that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> should be given between the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It was not fitting for the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> to be given at once after the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: both because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was so confident in his own reason, that he did not acknowledge his need of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>; because as yet the dictate of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> was not darkened by <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should not be given save to the people, since it is a general precept, as stated above (90, A2,3); wherefore at the time of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave men certain familiar, and, as it were, household precepts: but when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> descendants had multiplied, so as to form a people, and when they had been freed from slavery, it was fitting that they should be given a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; for "slaves are not that part of the people or state to which it is fitting for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to be directed," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. iii, 2,4,5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> had to be given to the people, not only those, of whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born, received the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, but the whole people, who were marked with the seal of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which was the sign of the promise made to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and in which he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse11">Romans 4:11</a>: hence even before David, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> had to be given to that people as soon as they were collected together.
