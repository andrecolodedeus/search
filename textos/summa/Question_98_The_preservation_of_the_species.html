<h1>Question 98. The preservation of the species</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1098.htm#article1"> In the state of innocence, would there have been generation?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1098.htm#article2"> Would generation have been through coition?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether in the state of innocence generation existed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem there would have been no generation in the state of innocence. For, as stated in Phys. v, 5, "corruption is contrary to generation." But contraries affect the same subject: also there would have been no corruption in the state of innocence. Therefore neither would there have been generation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the object of generation is the preservation in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that which is corruptible in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Wherefore there is no generation in those <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> things which last for ever. But in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have lived for ever. Therefore in the state of innocence there would have been no generation.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by generation <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is multiplied. But the multiplication of masters requires the division of property, to avoid confusion of mastership. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made master of the animals, it would have been <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to make a division of rights when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> increased by generation. This is against the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, according to which all things are in common, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 4). Therefore there would have been no generation in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis 1:28</a>): "Increase and multiply, and fill the earth." But this increase could not come about save by generation, since the original number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> was two only. Therefore there would have been generation in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the state of innocence there would have been generation of offspring for the multiplication of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; otherwise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would have been very <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for such a great <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> to be its result. We must, therefore, observe that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is established, as it were, midway between corruptible and incorruptible creatures, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> incorruptible, while his body is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> corruptible. We must also observe that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> purpose appears to be different as regards corruptible and incorruptible things. For that seems to be the direct purpose of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is invariable and perpetual; while what is only for a time is seemingly not the chief purpose of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but as it were, subordinate to something else; otherwise, when it ceased to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> purpose would become void.

<p>Therefore, since in things corruptible none is everlasting and permanent except the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it follows that the chief purpose of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; for the preservation of which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation is ordained. On the other hand, incorruptible <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> survive, not only in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but also in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>; wherefore even the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> are included in the chief purpose of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Hence it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to beget offspring, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> corruptible body. But on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is incorruptible, it is fitting that the multitude of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> should be the direct purpose of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or rather of the Author of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, Who alone is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Wherefore, to provide for the multiplication of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, He established the begetting of offspring even in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the state of innocence the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was in itself corruptible, but it could be preserved from corruption by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore, since generation belongs to things corruptible, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not to be deprived thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although generation in the state of innocence might not have been required for the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, yet it would have been required for the multiplication of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In our present state a division of possessions is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> on account of the multiplicity of masters, inasmuch as community of possession is a source of strife, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Politic. ii, 5). In the state of innocence, however, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> would have been so ordered that without any danger of strife they would have used in common, according to each one's need, those things of which they were masters--a state of things to be observed even now among many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether in the state of innocence there would have been generation by coition?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that generation by coition would not have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the state of innocence. For, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 11; iv, 25), the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the terrestrial Paradise was "like an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>." But in the future state of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, when men will be like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, "they shall neither marry nor be <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>," as is written <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>. Therefore neither in paradise would there have been generation by coition.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, our first parents were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at the age of perfect development. Therefore, if generation by coition had <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they would have had intercourse while still in paradise: which was not the case according to <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> (<a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse1">Genesis 4:1</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in carnal intercourse, more than at any other time, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes like the beasts, on account of the vehement delight which he takes therein; whence contingency is praiseworthy, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> refrains from such pleasures. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is compared to beasts by reason of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa048.htm#verse13">Psalm 48:13</a>: "Man, when he was in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, did not understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to them." Therefore, before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there would have been no such intercourse of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in the state of innocence there would have been no corruption. But virginal integrity is corrupted by intercourse. Therefore there would have been no such thing in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm">Genesis 1-2</a>). But nothing is void in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> works. Therefore, even if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, there would have been such intercourse, to which the distinction of sex is ordained. Moreover, we are told that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was made to be a help to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse18">Genesis 2:18-20</a>). But she is not fitted to help <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> except in generation, because another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a more effective help in anything else. Therefore there would have been such generation also in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some of the earlier <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, considering the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> as regards generation in our present state, concluded that in the state of innocence generation would not have been effected in the same way. Thus <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> says (De Hom. Opif. xvii) that in paradise the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> would have been multiplied by some other means, as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were multiplied without coition by the operation of the Divine Power. He adds that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> male and female before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because He foreknew the mode of generation which would take place after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which He foresaw. But this is unreasonable. For what is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was neither acquired nor forfeited by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it is clear that generation by coition is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by reason of his animal life, which he possessed even before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as above explained (97, 3), just as it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to other perfect animals, as the corporeal members make it clear. So we cannot allow that these members would not have had a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> use, as other members had, before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Thus, as regards generation by coition, there are, in the present state of life, two things to be considered. One, which comes from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is the union of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; for in every act of generation there is an active and a passive principle. Wherefore, since wherever there is distinction of sex, the active principle is male and the passive is female; the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> demands that for the purpose of generation there should be concurrence of male and female. The second thing to be observed is a certain deformity of excessive <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which in the state of innocence would not have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, when the lower powers were entirely subject to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 26): "We must be far from supposing that offspring could not be begotten without <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. All the bodily members would have been equally moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, without ardent or wanton incentive, with calmness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In paradise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have been like an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in his spirituality of mind, yet with an animal life in his body. After the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will be like an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, spiritualized in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. Wherefore there is no parallel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 4), our first parents did not come together in paradise, because on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> they were ejected from paradise shortly after the creation of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; or because, having received the general Divine command relative to generation, they awaited the special command relative to time.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Beasts are without reason. In this way <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes, as it were, like them in coition, because he cannot moderate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. In the state of innocence nothing of this kind would have happened that was not regulated by reason, not because delight of sense was less, as some say (rather indeed would sensible delight have been the greater in proportion to the greater purity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and the greater sensibility of the body), but because the force of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> would not have so inordinately thrown itself into such pleasure, being curbed by reason, whose place it is not to lessen sensual pleasure, but to prevent the force of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> from cleaving to it immoderately. By "immoderately" I mean going beyond the bounds of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as a sober <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> does not take less pleasure in food taken in moderation than the <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">glutton</a>, but his <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> lingers less in such pleasures. This is what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> means by the words quoted, which do not exclude intensity of pleasure from the state of innocence, but ardor of desire and restlessness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> would not have been praiseworthy in the state of innocence, whereas it is praiseworthy in our present state, not because it removes fecundity, but because it excludes inordinate desire. In that state fecundity would have been without <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 26): In that state "intercourse would have been without prejudice to virginal integrity; this would have remained intact, as it does in the menses. And just as in giving birth the mother was then relieved, not by groans of pain, but by the instigations of maturity; so in conceiving, the union was one, not of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> desire, but of deliberate action."
