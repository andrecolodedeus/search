<h1>Question 98. The will and intellect of the damned</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5098.htm#article1"> Is every act of will in the damned evil?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5098.htm#article2"> Do they ever repent of the evil they have done?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5098.htm#article3"> Would they rather not be than be?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5098.htm#article4"> Would they wish others to be damned?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5098.htm#article5"> Do the wicked hate God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5098.htm#article6"> Can they demerit?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5098.htm#article7"> Can they make use of the knowledge acquired in this life?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5098.htm#article8"> Do they ever think of God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5098.htm#article9"> Do they see the glory of the blessed?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether every act of will in the damned is evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in the damned is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv), "the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> desire the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the best, namely to be, to live, to understand." Since, then, men who are damned are not worse off than the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, it would seem that they also can have a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv), "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is altogether involuntary." Therefore if the damned will anything, they will it as something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or apparently <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now a will that is directly ordered to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is itself <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore the damned can have a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, some will be damned who, while in this world, acquired certain <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for instance <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> who had civic <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now a will elicits praiseworthy acts by reason of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. Therefore there may be praiseworthy acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in some of the damned.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> An obstinate <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can never be inclined except to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are damned will be obstinate even as the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> [Cf. I, 64, 2]. Further, as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the damned is in relation to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the blessed in regard to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But the blessed never have an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Neither therefore have the damned any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A twofold will may be considered in the damned, namely the deliberate will and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> will. Their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is theirs not of themselves but of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Author of nature</a>, Who gave <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> this inclination which we call the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> will. Wherefore since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> remains in them, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> will in them can be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But their deliberate <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is theirs of themselves, inasmuch as it is in their power to be inclined by their affections to this or that. This <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in them always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and this because they are completely turned away from the last end of a right <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, nor can a will be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> except it be directed to that same end. Hence even though they will some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, they do not will it well so that one be able to call their <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on that account.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> must be understood of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> will, which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> inclination to some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And yet this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination is corrupted by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, in so far as this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which they desire <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> is desired by them under certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> circumstances [Cf. I, 64, 2, ad 5].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, does not move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but in so far as it is thought to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Yet it comes of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> that they esteem that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as though it were <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence their <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of civic <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> do not remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect us only in the civic life which will not remain after this life. Even though they remained, they would never come into action, being enchained, as it were, by the obstinacy of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the damned repent of the evil they have done?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the damned never repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> they have done. For <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> says on the Canticle [Cf. De Consideratione v, 12; De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio ix] that "the damned ever consent to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> they have done." Therefore they never repent of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they have committed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to wish one had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will. But the damned will never have a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will. Therefore the damned will never wish they had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>: and thus the same conclusion follows as above.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii), "death is to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> what their fall was to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> will is irrevocable after his fall, so that he cannot withdraw from the choice whereby he previously <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> [Cf. I, 64, 2]. Therefore the damned also cannot repent of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed by them.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the wickedness of the damned in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> will be greater than that of sinners in the world. Now in this world some sinners repent not of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they have committed, either through blindness of mind, as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, or through obstinacy, as those "who are glad when they have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and rejoice in most wicked things" (<a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse14">Proverbs 2:14</a>). Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said of the damned (<a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse3">Wisdom 5:3</a>): "Repenting within themselves [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Saying within themselves, repenting']."

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 4) that "the wicked are full of repentance; for afterwards they are sorry for that in which previously they took pleasure." Therefore the damned, being most wicked, repent all the more.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may repent of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in two ways: in one way directly, in another way indirectly. He repents of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> directly who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as such: and he repents indirectly who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> it on account of something connected with it, for instance punishment or something of that kind. Accordingly the wicked will not repent of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> directly, because consent in the malice of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will remain in them; but they will repent indirectly, inasmuch as they will suffer from the punishment inflicted on them for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The damned will wickedness, but shun punishment: and thus indirectly they repent of wickedness committed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To wish one had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> on account of the shamefulness of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will: but this will not be in the wicked.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It will be possible for the damned to repent of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without turning their will away from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they will shun, not what they heretofore desired, but something else, namely the punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> However obstinate men may be in this world, they repent of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> indirectly, if they be punished for them. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Q83, qu. 36): "We see the most savage beasts are deterred from the greatest pleasures by fear of pain."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the damned by right and deliberate reason would wish not to be?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem impossible for the damned, by right and deliberate reason, to wish not to be. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. iii, 7): "Consider how great a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it is to be; since both the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and the unhappy will it; for to be and yet to be unhappy is a greater thing than not to be at all."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> argues thus (De Lib. Arb. iii, 8): "Preference supposes election." But "not to be" is not eligible; since it has not the appearance of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for it is nothing. Therefore not to be cannot be more desirable to the damned than "to be."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the more to be shunned. Now "not to be" is the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since it removes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> altogether, so as to leave nothing. Therefore "not to be" is more to be shunned than to be unhappy: and thus the same conclusion follows as above.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rev009.htm#verse6">Apocalypse 9:6</a>): "In those days men . . . shall desire to die, and death shall fly from them."

<p>Further, the unhappiness of the damned surpasses all unhappiness of this world. Now in order to escape the unhappiness of this world, it is desirable to some to die, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/sir041.htm#verse3">Sirach 41:3-4</a>): "O death, thy sentence is welcome to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is in need and to him whose strength faileth; who is in a decrepit age, and that is in care about all things, and to the distrustful that loseth wisdom [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'patience']." Much more, therefore, is "not to be" desirable to the damned according to their deliberate reason.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Not to be may be considered in two ways. First, in itself, and thus it can nowise be desirable, since it has no aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but is pure privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Secondly, it may be considered as a relief from a painful life or from some unhappiness: and thus "not to be" takes on the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since "to lack an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1). In this way it is better for the damned not to be than to be unhappy. Hence it is said (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse24">Matthew 26:24</a>): "It were better for him, if that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not been born," and (<a href="../bible/jer020.htm#verse14">Jeremiah 20:14</a>): "<a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">Cursed</a> be the day wherein I was born," where a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> observes: "It is better not to be than to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evilly</a>." In this sense the damned can prefer "not to be" according to their deliberate reason [Cf. I, 5, 2, ad 3].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is to be understood in the sense that "not to be" is eligible, not in itself but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as putting an end to unhappiness. For when it is stated that "to be" and "to live" are desired by all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, we are not to take this as referable to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and corrupt life, and a life of unhappiness, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 4), but absolutely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Non-existence is eligible, not in itself, but only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as stated already.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although "not to be" is very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in so far as it removes being, it is very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in so far as it removes unhappiness, which is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and thus it is preferred "not to be."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether in hell the damned would wish others were damned who are not damned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> the damned would not wish others were damned who are not damned. For it is said (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse27">Luke 16:27-28</a>) of the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for his brethren, lest they should come "into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">place of torments</a>." Therefore in like manner the other damned would not wish, at least their friends in the flesh to be damned in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the damned are not deprived of their inordinate affections. Now some of the damned loved inordinately some who are not damned. Therefore they would not desire their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, i.e. that they should be damned.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the damned do not desire the increase of their punishment. Now if more were damned, their punishment would be greater, even as the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the blessed is increased by an increase in their number. Therefore the damned desire not the damnation of those who are saved.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse9">Isaiah 14:9</a>, "are risen up from their thrones," says: "The wicked are comforted by having many companions in their punishment."

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> reigns supreme in the damned. Therefore they grieve for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the blessed, and desire their damnation.

<p><strong>I answer that</strong> Even as in the blessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> there will be most perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so in the damned there will be the most perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>. Wherefore as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will rejoice in all goods, so will the damned grieve for all goods. Consequently the sight of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will give them very great pain; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse11">Isaiah 26:11</a>): "Let the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> people see and be confounded, and let fire devour Thy enemies." Therefore they will wish all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> were damned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> So great will be the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the damned that they will <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> even of their kindred, since they themselves are supremely unhappy, for this happens even in this life, when <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> increases. Nevertheless they will <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> their kindred less than others, and their punishment would be greater if all their kindred were damned, and others saved, than if some of their kindred were saved. For this reason the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that his brethren might be warded from damnation: for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that some are guarded therefrom. Yet he would rather that his brethren were damned as well as all the rest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Love that is not based on <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is easily voided, especially in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 4). Hence the damned will not preserve their friendship for those whom they loved inordinately. Yet the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of them will remain perverse, because they will continue to love the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their inordinate <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although an increase in the number of the damned results in an increase of each one's punishment, so much the more will their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> increase that they will prefer to be more tormented with many rather than less tormented alone.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the damned hate God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the damned do not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv), "the beautiful and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and beauty is beloved of all." But this is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be the object of anyone's <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one can <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> itself, as neither can one will badness itself since "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is altogether involuntary," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> asserts (Div. Nom. iv). Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> itself. Therefore no one can <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa073.htm#verse23">Psalm 73:23</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Thee ascendeth continually."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is moved by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> apprehended. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is apprehended in two ways, namely in Himself, as by the blessed, who see Him in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and in His effects, as by us and by the damned. Since, then, He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, He cannot in Himself be displeasing to any will; wherefore whoever sees Him in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Him. On the other hand, some of His effects are displeasing to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in so far as they are opposed to any one: and accordingly a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not in Himself, but by reason of His effects. Therefore the damned, perceiving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His punishment, which is the effect of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Him, even as they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the punishment inflicted on them [Cf. 90, 3, ad 2; II-II, 34, 1].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The saying of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> refers to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and even this is rendered perverse in the damned, by that which is added thereto by their deliberate will, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) [Cf. II-II, 34, 1, ad 1 where <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> gives another answer].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument would <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> if the damned <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">saw God in Himself</a>, as being in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the damned demerit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the damned demerit. For the damned have an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will, as stated in the last Distinction of Sentent. iv. But they demerited by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will that they had here. Therefore if they demerit not there, their damnation is to their advantage.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the damned are on the same footing as the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> demerit after their fall, wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> inflicted a punishment on the serpent, who induced <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse14">Genesis 3:14-15</a>). Therefore the damned also demerit.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an inordinate act that proceeds from a deliberate <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not excused from demerit, even though there be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of which one is oneself the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: for the "<a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunken</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deserves a double punishment" if he commit a crime through being <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunk</a> (Ethic. iii). Now the damned were themselves the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their own obstinacy, owing to which they are under a kind of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Therefore since their act proceeds from their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, they are not excused from demerit.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Punishment is contradistinguished from fault [Cf. I, 48, 5]. Now the perverse will of the damned proceeds from their obstinacy which is their punishment. Therefore the perverse will of the damned is not a fault whereby they may demerit.

<p>Further, after reaching the last term there is no further movement, or advancement in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now the damned, especially after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a>, will have reached the last term of their damnation, since then there "will cease to be two cities," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion cxi). Therefore after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a> the damned will not demerit by their perverse will, for if they did their damnation would be augmented.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must draw a distinction between the damned before the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a> and after. For all are agreed that after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a> there will be neither <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> nor demerit. The reason for this is because <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit is directed to the attainment of some further <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will have reached their ultimate consummation, so that there will be no further addition to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will in the blessed will not be a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> but a reward, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will in the damned will be not a demerit but a punishment only. For works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> belong especially to the state of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and their contraries to the state of unhappiness (Ethic. i, 9,10).

<p>On the other hand, some say that, before the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a>, both the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and the damned demerit. But this cannot apply to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward or to the principal punishment, since in this respect both have reached the term. Possibly, however, this may apply to the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward, or secondary punishment, which are subject to increase until the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>. Especially may this apply to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, by whose activities some are drawn to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the blessed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is increased, and some to damnation, whereby the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> is augmented [Cf. I, 62, 9, ad 3; II-II, 13, 4, ad 2; where <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> tacitly retracts the opinion expressed here as to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit.].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is in the highest degree unprofitable to have reached the highest degree of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the result being that the damned are incapable of demerit. Hence it is clear that they gain no advantage from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Men who are damned are not occupied in drawing others to damnation, as the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are, for which reason the latter demerit as regards their secondary punishment [Cf. I, 62, 9, ad 3; II-II, 13 , 4, ad 2; where <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> tacitly retracts the opinion expressed here as to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The reason why they are not excused from demerit is not because they are under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, but because they have reached the highest of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. However, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> whereof we are ourselves the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> needs to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>: but it does not excuse, in so far as it proceeds from a previous act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: and consequently the whole demerit of the subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would seem to belong to the previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the damned can make use of the knowledge they had in this world? [Cf. I, 89]</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the damned are unable to make use of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> they had in this world. For there is very great pleasure in the consideration of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But we must not admit that they have any pleasure. Therefore they cannot make use of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> they had heretofore, by applying their consideration thereto.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the damned suffer greater pains than any pains of this world. Now in this world, when one is in very great pain, it is impossible to consider any intelligible conclusions, through being distracted by the pains that one suffers. Much less therefore can one do so in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the damned are subject to <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. But "length of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of forgetfulness" (Phys. lib. iv, 13). Therefore the damned will forget what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> here.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said to the rich man who was damned (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse25">Luke 16:25</a>): "Remember that thou didst receive <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in thy lifetime," etc. Therefore they will consider about the things they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> here.

<p>Further, the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> remain in the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (70, 2, ad 3; I, 89, 5,6). Therefore, if they could not use them, these would remain in them to no purpose.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Even as in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> on account of the perfection of their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, there will be nothing but what is a matter of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> so there will be nothing in the damned but what is a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow; nor will anything that can pertain to sorrow be lacking, so that their unhappiness is consummate. Now the consideration of certain things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> brings us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, in some respect, either on the part of the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, because we love them, or on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, because it is fitting and perfect. There may also be a reason for sorrow both on the part of the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, because they are of a grievous <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, if we consider its imperfection; for instance a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may consider his defective <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about a certain thing, which he would desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> perfectly. Accordingly, in the damned there will be actual consideration of the things they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> heretofore as matters of sorrow, but not as a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure. For they will consider both the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> they have done, and for which they were damned, and the delightful goods they have lost, and on both counts they will suffer torments. Likewise they will be tormented with the thought that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> they had of speculative matters was imperfect, and that they missed its highest degree of perfection which they might have acquired.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the consideration of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is delightful in itself, it may <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In this world the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to a corruptible body, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> consideration is hindered by the suffering of the body. On the other hand, in the future life the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will not be so drawn by the body, but however much the body may suffer, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will have a most clear view of those things that can be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of anguish to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">Time</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> forgetfulness <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in so far as the movement whereof it is the measure is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of change. But after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a> there will be no movement of the heavens; wherefore neither will it be possible for forgetfulness to result from any lapse of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> however long. Before the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a>, however, the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not changed from its disposition by the heavenly movement.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the damned will ever think of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the damned will sometimes think of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For one cannot <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> a thing <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">actually</a>, except one think about it. Now the damned will <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated in the text of Sentent. iv, in the last Distinction. Therefore they will think of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the damned will have remorse of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> suffers remorse for <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore they will sometimes think of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Man's most perfect thoughts are those which are about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: whereas the damned will be in a state of the greatest imperfection. Therefore they will not think of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> one may think of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in two ways. First, in Himself and according to that which is proper to Him, namely that He is the fount of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>: and thus it is altogether impossible to think of Him without delight, so that the damned will by no means think of Him in this way. Secondly, according to something <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> as it were to Him in His effects, such as His punishments, and so forth, and in this respect the thought of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can bring sorrow, so that in this way the damned will think of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The damned do not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> except because He punishes and forbids what is agreeable to their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will: and consequently they will think of Him only as punishing and forbidding.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection, since <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> will not have remorse for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> except as forbidden by the Divine commandment.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether the damned see the glory of the blessed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the damned do not see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the blessed. For they are more distant from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the blessed than from the happenings of this world. But they do not see what happens in regard to us: hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse21">Job 14:21</a>, "Whether his children come to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>," etc. says (<a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">Moral</a>. xii): "Even as those who still live <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not in what place are the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead; so the dead who have lived in the body <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the things which regard the life of those who are in the flesh." Much less, therefore, can they see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the blessed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is granted as a great favor to the saints in this life is never granted to the damned. Now it was granted as a great favor to Paul to see the life in which the saints live for ever with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>). Therefore the damned will not see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the saints.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse23">Luke 16:23</a>) that the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the midst of his torments "saw <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> . . . and Lazarus in his <a href="../cathen/01055a.htm">bosom</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The damned, before the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a>, will see the blessed in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in such a way as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, not what that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is like, but only that they are in a state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that surpasses all thought. This will trouble them, both because they will, through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, grieve for their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and because they have forfeited that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse2">Wisdom 5:2</a>) concerning the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: "Seeing it" they "shall be troubled with terrible fear." After the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a>, however, they will be altogether deprived of seeing the blessed: nor will this lessen their punishment, but will increase it; because they will bear in remembrance the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the blessed which they saw at or before the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment</a>: and this will torment them. Moreover they will be tormented by finding themselves deemed unworthy even to see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to have.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The happenings of this life would not, if seen, torment the damned in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> as the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; wherefore the things which happen here are not shown to the damned in the same way as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; although also of the things that happen here those are shown to them which are capable of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> them sorrow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> looked upon that life wherein the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> live with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [Cf. II-II, 185, 3, ad 2], by actual experience thereof and by hoping to have it more perfectly in the life to come. Not so the damned; wherefore the comparison fails.
