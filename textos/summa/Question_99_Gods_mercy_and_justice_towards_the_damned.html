<h1>Question 99. God's mercy and justice towards the damned</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5099.htm#article1"> By Divine justice, is an eternal punishment inflicted on sinners?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5099.htm#article2"> By God's mercy, does all punishment both of men and of demons come to an end?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5099.htm#article3"> Does at least the punishment of men come to an end?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5099.htm#article4"> Does at least the punishment of Christians have an end?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5099.htm#article5"> Is there an end to the punishment of those who have performed works of mercy?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether by Divine justice an eternal punishment is inflicted on sinners? [Cf. I-II, 87, 3,4</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> is not inflicted on sinners by Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For the punishment should not exceed the fault: "According to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall the measure also of the stripes be" (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>). Now fault is temporal. Therefore the punishment should not be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, of two mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> one is greater than the other. and therefore one should receive a greater punishment than the other. But no punishment is greater than <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, since it is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> is not due to every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and if it is not due to one, it is due to none, since they are not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> distant from one another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a just judge does not punish except in order to correct, wherefore it is stated (Ethic. ii, 3) that "punishments are a kind of medicine." Now, to punish the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> does not lead to their correction, nor to that of others, since then there will be no one in future who can be corrected thereby. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> is not inflicted for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> according to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no one wishes that which is not desirable for its own sake, except on account of some advantage. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not wish punishment for its own sake, for He delights not in punishments [The allusion is to <a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse13">Wisdom 1:13</a>: "Neither hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living," as may be gathered from I-II, 87, 3, Objection 3]. Since then no advantage can result from the perpetuity of punishment, it would seem that He ought not to inflict such a punishment for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, "nothing <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> lasts for ever" (De Coelo et Mundo i). But punishment is one of those things that happen <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, since it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it cannot be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">everlasting</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would seem to require that sinners should be brought to naught: because on account of ingratitude a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> deserves to lose all benefits, and among other benefits of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is "being" itself. Therefore it would seem <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> that the sinner who has been ungrateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should lose his being. But if sinners be brought to naught, their punishment cannot be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">everlasting</a>. Therefore it would seem out of keeping with Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that sinners should be punished for ever.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse46">Matthew 25:46</a>): "These," namely the wicked, "shall go into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>."

<p>Further, as reward is to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, so is punishment to guilt. Now, according to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward is due to temporal <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>: "Every one who seeth the Son and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in Him hath [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'that everyone . . . may have'] life everlasting." Therefore according to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> an <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a> is due to temporal guilt.

<p>Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 5), punishment is meted according to the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against, so that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who strikes one in authority receives a greater punishment than one who strikes anyone else. Now whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose commandments he breaks, and Whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> he gives another, by placing his end in some one other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> majesty is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally deserves <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> punishment; and consequently it seems just that for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> a man should be punished for ever.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since punishment is measured in two ways, namely according to the degree of its severity, and according to its length of time, the measure of punishment corresponds to the measure of fault, as regards the degree of severity, so that the more grievously a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> the more grievously is he punished: "As much as she hath glorified herself and lived in delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye to her" (<a href="../bible/rev018.htm#verse7">Apocalypse 18:7</a>). The duration of the punishment does not, however, correspond with the duration of the fault, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 11), for <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> which is committed in a short space of time is not punished with a momentary penalty even according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws [Cf. I-II, 87, 3, ad 1]. But the duration of punishment regards the disposition of the sinner: for sometimes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who commits an offense in a city is rendered by his very offense worthy of being cut off entirely from the fellowship of the citizens, either by perpetual exile or even by death: whereas sometimes he is not rendered worthy of being cut off entirely from the fellowship of the citizens. wherefore in order that he may become a fitting member of the State, his punishment is prolonged or curtailed, according as is expedient for his amendment, so that he may live in the city in a becoming and peaceful manner. So too, according to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> renders a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> worthy to be altogether cut off from the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> city, and this is the effect of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is the bond uniting this same city together. Consequently, for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is expelled for ever from the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and condemned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>, because as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 11), "as men are cut off from this perishable city by the penalty of the first death, so are they excluded from that imperishable city by the punishment of the second death." That the punishment inflicted by the earthly state is not deemed everlasting is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, either because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> endures not for ever, or because the state itself comes to an end. Wherefore if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lived for ever, the punishment of exile or slavery, which is pronounced by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, would remain in him for ever. On the other hand, as regards those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in such a way as not to deserve to be entirely cut off from the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, such as those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially, their punishment will be so much the shorter or longer according as they are more or less fit to be cleansed, through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> clinging to them more or less: this is observed in the punishments of this world and of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> according to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p>We find also other reasons given by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> why some are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> condemned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a> for a temporal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. One is because they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by despising <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. This is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei. xii, 12): "He is become worthy of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, who destroyed in himself a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which could be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>." Another reason is because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in his own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> [Cf. I-II, 87, 3, ad 1]; wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. iv), it belongs to the great <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the judge that those should never cease to be punished, who in this life never ceased to desire <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And if it be objected that some who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally propose to amend their life at some time, and that these accordingly are seemingly not deserving of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, it must be replied according to some that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> speaks of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that is made manifest by the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. For he who falls into mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of his own will puts himself in a state whence he cannot be rescued, except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> help him: wherefore from the very fact that he is willing to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he is willing to remain in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for ever. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is "a wind that goeth," namely to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, "and returneth not by his own power" (<a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse39">Psalm 77:39</a>). Thus if a man were to throw himself into a pit whence he could not get out without help, one might say that he wished to remain there for ever, whatever else he may have thought himself. Another and a better answer is that from the very fact that he commits a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he places his end in a creature; and since the whole of life is directed to its end, it follows that for this very reason he directs the whole of his life to that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and is willing to remain in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> forever, if he could do so with impunity. This is what <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says on <a href="../bible/job041.htm#verse23">Job 41:23</a>, "He shall esteem the deep as growing old" (Moral. xxxiv): "The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> only put an end to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> because their life came to an end: they would indeed have wished to live for ever, that they might continue in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for ever for they desire rather to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than to live." Still another reason may be given why the punishment of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>: because thereby one offends <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Wherefore since punishment cannot be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in intensity, because the creature is incapable of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, it must needs be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> at least in duration. And again there is a fourth reason for the same: because guilt remains for ever, since it cannot be remitted without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and men cannot receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> after death; nor should punishment cease so long as guilt remains.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Punishment has not to be equal to fault as to the amount of duration as is seen to be the case also with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws. We may also reply with <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Dial. xliv) that although <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is temporal in act, it is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The degree of intensity in the punishment corresponds to the degree of gravity in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; wherefore mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> unequal in gravity will receive a punishment unequal in intensity but equal in duration.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The punishments inflicted on those who are not altogether expelled from the society of their fellow-citizens are intended for their correction: whereas those punishments, whereby certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are wholly banished from the society of their fellow-citizens, are not intended for their correction; although they may be intended for the correction and tranquillity of the others who remain in the state. Accordingly the damnation of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is for the correction of those who are now in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for punishments are intended for correction, not only when they are being inflicted, but also when they are decreed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will not be altogether useless. For they are useful for two purposes. First, because thereby the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is safeguarded which is acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its own sake. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. iv): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> on account of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> kindness delights not in the torments of the unhappy, but on account of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. He is for ever unappeased by the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>." Secondly, they are useful, because the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> rejoice therein, when they see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in them, and realize that they have escaped them. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/psa057.htm#verse12">Psalm 57:12</a>): "The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge," etc., and (<a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse24">Isaiah 66:24</a>): "They," namely the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, "shall be a loathsome sight* to all flesh," namely to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says. ["Ad satietatem visionis," which <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> takes to signify being satiated with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; Cf. 94, 3]. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> expresses himself in the same sense (Dial. iv): "The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are all condemned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, and are punished for their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Yet they will burn to some purpose, namely that the just may all both see in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joys</a> they receive, and perceive in them the torments they have escaped: for which reason they will acknowledge themselves for ever the debtors of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> the more that they will see how the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which they overcame by its assistance are punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Although the punishment relates to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, it relates <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> infected with guilt. And since guilt will remain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for ever, its punishment also will be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">everlasting</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Punishment corresponds to fault, properly speaking, in respect of the inordinateness in the fault, and not of the dignity in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> offended: for if the latter were the case, a punishment of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> intensity would correspond to every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Accordingly, although a man deserves to lose his being from the fact that he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the author of his being, yet, in view of the inordinateness of the act itself, loss of being is not due to him, since being is presupposed to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and demerit, nor is being lost or corrupted by the inordinateness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> [Cf. I-II, 85, 1]: and consequently privation of being cannot be the punishment due to any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether by God's mercy all punishment of the damned, both men and demons, comes to an end?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy all punishment of the damned, both men and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, comes to an end. For it is written (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse24">Wisdom 11:24</a>): "Thou hast mercy upon all, O Lord, because Thou canst do all things." But among all things the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> also are included, since they are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures. Therefore also their punishment will come to an end.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath concluded all in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'unbelief'], that He may have mercy on all" (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse32">Romans 11:32</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has concluded the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that is to say, He permitted them to be concluded. Therefore it would seem that in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> He has mercy even on the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (Cur Deus Homo ii), "it is not just that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should permit the utter loss of a creature which He made for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>." Therefore, since every rational creature was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, it would seem <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> for it to be allowed to perish altogether.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew 25:41</a>): "Depart from Me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, which is prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." Therefore they will be punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>.

<p>Further, just as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> through turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">bad angels</a> were made unhappy through turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore if the unhappiness of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">wicked angels</a> comes at length to an end, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will also come to an end, which is inadmissible.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxi) <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> [Cf. I, 64, 2] "<a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in maintaining that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> will at length, through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy, be <a href="../cathen/01599a.htm">delivered from their punishment</a>." But this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> has been condemned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for two reasons. First because it is clearly contrary to the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> (<a href="../bible/rev020.htm#verse9">Apocalypse 20:9-10</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who seduced them was cast into the pool of fire and brimstone, where both the beasts and the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the beast and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> prophet,' etc.] shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever," which is the Scriptural expression for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Secondly, because this opinion exaggerated <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy in one direction and depreciated it in another. For it would seem equally reasonable for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to remain in eternal happiness, and for the wicked <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to be eternally punished. Wherefore just as he maintained that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the damned are to be <a href="../cathen/01599a.htm">delivered</a> at length from their sufferings, so he maintained that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed will at length pass from their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> state to the unhappiness of this life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for His own part, has mercy on all. Since, however, His mercy is ruled by the order of His wisdom, the result is that it does not reach to certain people who render themselves unworthy of that mercy, as do the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and the damned who are obstinate in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. And yet we may say that even in them His mercy finds a place, in so far as they are punished less than they deserve condignly, but not that they are entirely delivered from punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the words quoted the distribution (of the predicate) regards the genera and not the individuals: so that the statement applies to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the state of wayfarer, inasmuch as He had mercy both on <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and on <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, but not on every <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> or every <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> means that it is not just in the sense of becoming <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and is speaking of the creature generically. For it becomes not the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> that a whole genus of creature fail of the end for which it was made: wherefore it is unbecoming for all men or all <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to be damned. But there is no reason why some men or some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> should perish for ever, because the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the Divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is fulfilled in the others who are saved.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God's mercy suffers at least men to be punished eternally?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy does not suffer at least men to be punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/gen006.htm#verse3">Genesis 6:3</a>): "My spirit shall not remain in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for ever because he is flesh"; where "spirit" denotes indignation, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> indignation is not distinct from His punishment, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will not be punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in this life makes them <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for their enemies. Now they will have more perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in that life. Therefore they will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> then for their enemies who are damned. But the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> cannot be in vain, since they are most acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore at the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>' <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the Divine mercy will in time deliver the damned from their punishment.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foretelling of the punishment of the damned belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of commination. Now the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of commination is not always fulfilled: as appears from what was said of the destruction of Nineve (<a href="../bible/jon003.htm">Jonah 3</a>); and yet it was not destroyed as foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who also was troubled for that very reason (<a href="../bible/jon004.htm#verse1">Jonah 4:1</a>). Therefore it would seem that much more will the threat of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> be commuted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy for a more lenient punishment, when this will be able to give sorrow to none but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to all.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the words of <a href="../bible/psa076.htm#verse8">Psalm 76:8</a> are to the point, where it is said: "Will <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> then be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> for ever? [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Will <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> then cast off for ever?']" But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is His punishment. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse19">Isaiah 14:19</a>, "But thou art cast out," etc. says: "Even though all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> shall have rest at last, thou never shalt": and it refers to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Therefore it would seem that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> shall at length have rest from their pains.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse46">Matthew 25:46</a>) of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> conjointly with the damned: "These shall go into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>: but the just, into life everlasting." But it is inadmissible that the life of the just will ever have an end. Therefore it is inadmissible that the punishment of the damned will ever come to an end.

<p>Further, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii) "death is to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> what their fall was to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." Now after their fall the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> could not be restored [Cf. I, 64, 2]. Therefore neither can <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> after death: and thus the punishment of the damned will have no end.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 17,18), some evaded the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> by asserting that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are punished everlastingly, while holding that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, even unbelievers, are at length set free from punishment. But this statement is altogether unreasonable. For just as the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are obstinate in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and therefore have to be punished for ever, so too are the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who die without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since "death is to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> what their fall was to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying refers to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> generically, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> indignation was at length removed from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> by the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But those who were unwilling to be included or to remain in this reconciliation effected by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, perpetuated the Divine <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in themselves, since no other way of reconciliation is given to us save that which is through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xxi, 24) and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (<a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">Moral</a>. xxxiv) say, the saints in this life <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for their enemies, that they may be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while it is yet possible for them to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>. For if we knew that they were foreknown to death, we should no more <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them than for the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. And since for those who depart this life without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> there will be no further time for conversion, no <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> will be offered for them, neither by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant, nor by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> triumphant. For that which we have to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them is, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse25">2 Timothy 2:25-26</a>), that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may give them repentance to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and they may recover themselves from the snares of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A punishment threatened <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> is only then commuted when there is a change in the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> threatened. Hence: "I will suddenly speak against a nation and against a kingdom, to root out and to pull down and to destroy it. If that nation . . . shall repent of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, I also will repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I have thought to do to them" (<a href="../bible/jer018.htm#verse7">Jeremiah 18:7</a>). Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of the damned cannot be changed, the threatened punishment will ever be fulfilled in them. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of commination is always fulfilled in a certain sense, because as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei. xxi, 24): "Nineve has been overthrown, that was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> Nineve is built up, that was not: for while the walls and the houses remained standing, the city was overthrown in its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ways."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> These words of the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalm</a> refer to the vessels of mercy, which have not made themselves unworthy of mercy, because in this life (which may be called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> on account of its unhappiness) He changes vessels of mercy into something better. Hence the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalm</a> continues (<a href="../bible/psa076.htm#verse11">Psalm 76:11</a>): "This is the change of the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a>." We may also reply that they refer to mercy as granting a relaxation but not setting free altogether if it be referred also to the damned. Hence the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalm</a> does not say: "Will He from His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> shut up His mercies?" but "in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>," because the punishment will not be done away entirely; but His mercy will have effect by diminishing the punishment while it continues.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> is speaking not absolutely but on an impossible supposition in order to throw into relief the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor's</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the punishment of Christians is brought to an end by the mercy of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that at least the punishment of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is brought to an end by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. "For he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall be saved" (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse16">Mark 16:16</a>). Now this applies to every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> will at length be saved.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse55">John 6:55</a>): "He that eateth My body and drinketh My blood hath <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>." Now this is the meat and drink whereof <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> partake in common. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> will be saved at length.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> work burn, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire" (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>), where it is a question of those who have the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore all such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> will be saved in the end.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 6:9</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> shall not possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Now some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> will not all come to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, and consequently they will be punished for ever.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse21">2 Peter 2:21</a>): "It had been better for them not to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, than after they have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, to turn back from that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> commandment which was delivered to them." Now those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will be punished for ever. Therefore <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who have turned back after <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it will also be punished for ever.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xxi, 20,21), there have been some who predicted a delivery from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> not for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but only for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, although they stated the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in different ways. For some said that whoever received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> would be immune from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>. But this is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since some receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and yet have not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, without which "it is impossible to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>). Wherefore others said that those alone will be exempt from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> who have received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and professed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But against this it would seem to be that at one time some people profess the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and afterwards abandon it, and these are deserving not of a lesser but of a greater punishment, since according to <a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse21">2 Peter 2:21</a>, "it had been better for them not to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> than, after they have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, to turn back." Moreover it is clear that heresiarchs who renounce the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and invent new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more grievously than those who have conformed to some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> from the first. And therefore some have maintained that those alone are exempt from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, who persevere to the end in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, however guilty they may have been of other crimes. But this is clearly contrary to <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse20">James 2:20</a>): "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> without works is dead," and (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse21">Matthew 7:21</a>) "Not every one that saith to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>: but he that doth the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of My Father Who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>": and in many other passages <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> threatens sinners with <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>. Consequently those who persevere in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unto the end will not all be exempt from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, unless in the end they <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> to be free from other crimes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> speaks there of formed <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> [Cf. II-II, 4, 3] "that worketh by love [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>'; <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians 5:6</a>]": wherein whosoever dieth shall be saved. But to this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> not only is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of unbelief opposed, but also any mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatsoever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> refers not to those who partake only sacramentally, and who sometimes by receiving unworthily "eat and drink judgment" to themselves (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse29">1 Corinthians 11:29</a>), but to those who eat spiritually and are incorporated with Him by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which incorporation is the effect of the sacramental eating, in those who approach worthily [Cf. III, 80, 1,2,3]. Wherefore, so far as the power of the sacrament is concerned, it brings us to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, although <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may deprive us of that fruit, even after we have received worthily.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In this passage of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> the foundation denotes formed <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, upon which whosoever shall build venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> [Cf. I-II, 89, 2] "shall suffer loss," because he will be punished for them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; yet "he himself shall be saved" in the end "by fire," either of temporal tribulation, or of the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> which will be after death.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether all those who perform works of mercy will be punished eternally?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all who perform <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> will not be punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, but only those who neglect those works. For it is written (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse13">James 2:13</a>): "Judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy"; and (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse7">Matthew 5:7</a>): "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse35">Matthew 25:35-46</a>) we find a description of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> discussion with the damned and the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>. But this discussion is only about <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> will be awarded only to such as have omitted to practice <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>: and consequently the same conclusion follows as before.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew 6:12</a>): "Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors," and further on (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse14">Matthew 6:14</a>): "For if you will forgive men their offenses, your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">heavenly Father</a> will forgive you also your offenses." Therefore it would seem that the merciful, who forgive others their offenses, will themselves obtain the forgiveness of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and consequently will not be punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> on <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 4:8</a>, "<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Godliness</a> is profitable to all things," says: "The sum total of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian's</a> rule of life consists in mercy and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>. Let a man follow this, and though he should suffer from the inconstancy of the flesh, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he will be scourged, but he will not perish: whereas he who can boast of no other exercise but that of the body will suffer <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>." Therefore those who persevere in <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>, though they be shackled with fleshly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, will not be punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>: and thus the same conclusion follows as before.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 6:9-10</a>): "Neither fornicators . . . nor <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterers</a>," etc. "shall possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Yet many are such who practice <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>. Therefore the merciful will not all come to the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal kingdom</a>: and consequently some of them will be punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse10">James 2:10</a>): "Whosoever shall keep the whole <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all." Therefore whoever keeps the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> as regards the <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> and omits other works, is guilty of transgressing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and consequently will be punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the book quoted above (De Civ. Dei xxi, 22), some have maintained that not all who have professed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will be freed from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, but only those who persevere in <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>, although they be guilty of other crimes. But this cannot stand, because without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> nothing can be acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor does anything profit unto <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> in the absence of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now it happens that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> persevere in <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> without having <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Wherefore nothing profits them to the meriting of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, or to exemption from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, as may be gathered from <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>. Most evident is this in the case of those who <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">lay hands</a> on other people's property, for after seizing on many things, they nevertheless spend something in <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>. We must therefore conclude that all whosoever die in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> will free them from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, not even after any length of time whatever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those will obtain mercy who show mercy in an ordinate manner. But those who while merciful to others are neglectful of themselves do not show mercy ordinately, rather do they strike at themselves by their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil actions</a>. Wherefore such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> will not obtain the mercy that sets free altogether, even if they obtain that mercy which rebates somewhat their due punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The reason why the discussion refers only to the <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> is not because <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> will be inflicted on none but those who omit those works, but because <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> will be remitted to those who after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> have obtained forgiveness by their <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>, making unto themselves "friends of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke 16:9</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said this to those who ask that their debt be forgiven, but not to those who persist in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore the repentant alone will obtain by their works of mercy the forgiveness that sets them free altogether.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> speaks of the inconstancy that consists in venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, from which a man will be freed through the <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> after the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, which he calls a scourging. Or, if he speaks of the inconstancy of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the sense is that those who while yet in this life fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh through frailty are disposed to repentance by <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>. Wherefore such a one will not perish, that is to say, he will be disposed by those works not to perish, through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed on him by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, Who is blessed for evermore. Amen.
