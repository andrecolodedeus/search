<h1>Question 99. Sacrilege</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3099.htm#article1"> What is sacrilege?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3099.htm#article2"> Is it a special sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3099.htm#article3"> The species of sacrilege</a> <li><a href="../summa/3099.htm#article4"> The punishment of sacrilege</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether sacrilege is the violation of a sacred thing?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is not the violation of a sacred thing. It is stated (XVII, qu. iv [Append. Gratian, on can. Si quis suadente]): "They are guilty of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> who disagree about the sovereign's decision, and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> chosen by the sovereign be worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>." Now this seems to have no connection with anything sacred. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> does not denote the violation of something sacred.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is stated further on [Append. Gratian, on can. Constituit.] that if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall allow the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> to hold public offices, "he must be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> as being guilty of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>." Yet public offices have nothing to do with anything sacred. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> does not denote the violation of a sacred thing.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power is greater than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>. Now sacred things receive their sacred character from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore they cannot be violated by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and so a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> would not seem to be the violation of a sacred thing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x) that "a man is said to be sacrilegious because he selects," i.e. steals, "sacred things."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (81, 5; I-II, 101, 4), a thing is called "sacred" through being deputed to the divine worship. Now just as a thing acquires an aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> through being deputed to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end, so does a thing assume a divine character through being deputed to the divine worship, and thus a certain reverence is due to it, which reverence is referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore whatever pertains to irreverence for sacred things is an injury to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and comes under the head of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 2) the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the nation is a divine thing, wherefore in olden times the rulers of a commonwealth were called divines, as being the ministers of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, according to <a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse5">Wisdom 6:5</a>, "Being ministers of His kingdom, you have not judged rightly." Hence by an extension of the term, whatever savors of irreverence for the sovereign, such as disputing his judgment, and questioning whether one ought to follow it, is called <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> by a kind of likeness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are sanctified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>, "But you are washed, but you are sanctified." Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse9">1 Peter 2:9</a>): "You are a chosen generation, a kingly <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, a purchased people." Therefore any injury inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, for instance that unbelievers should be put in authority over it, is an irreverence for a sacred thing, and is reasonably called a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Violation here means any kind of irreverence or dishonor. Now as "<a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who honors and not in the one who is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>" (Ethic. i, 5), so again irreverence is in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who behaves irreverently even though he do no harm to the object of his irreverence. Hence, so far he is concerned, he violates the sacred thing, though the latter be not violated in itself.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether sacrilege is a special sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It is stated (XVII, qu. iv) "They are guilty of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> who through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the sanctity of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, violate and defile it by their negligence." But this is done in every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is "a word, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> or desire contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Faust. xxi, 27). Therefore <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is comprised under different kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> comprised under different kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for instance under <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, if one kill a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> under <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, as the violation of a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, or of any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in a sacred place under <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, if one steal a sacred thing. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to found apart from other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states, in speaking of special <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (Ethic. v, 11). But, seemingly, <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is not to be found apart from other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for it is sometimes united to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, sometimes to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, as stated in the preceding objection. Therefore it is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which is opposed to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is opposed to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, namely religion, to which it belongs to reverence <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and divine things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Wherever we find a special aspect of deformity, there must needs be a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; because the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a thing is derived chiefly from its formal aspect, and not from its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or subject. Now in <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> we find a special aspect of deformity, namely, the violation of a sacred thing by treating it irreverently. Hence it is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Moreover, it is opposed to religion. For according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iv, 3), "When the purple has been made into a royal robe, we pay it <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and homage, and if anyone dishonor it he is condemned to death," as acting against the king: and in the same way if a man violate a sacred thing, by so doing his behavior is contrary to the reverence due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and consequently he is guilty of irreligion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those are said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the sanctity of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a> who assail <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and blasphemers do. These are guilty of unbelief, through not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, through perverting the words of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing prevents one specific kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being found in various generic kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, inasmuch as various <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are directed to the end of one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, just as happens in the case of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> commanded by one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On this way, by whatever kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> a man acts counter to reverence due to sacred things, he commits a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> formally; although his act contains various kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> materially.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sacrilege is sometimes found apart from other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, through its act having no other deformity than the violation of a sacred thing: for instance, if a judge were to take a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from a sacred place for he might lawfully have taken him from elsewhere.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the species of sacrilege are distinguished according to the sacred things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> are not distinguished according to the sacred things. Material diversity does not differentiate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, if the formal aspect remains the same. Now there would seem to be the same formal aspect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in all violations of sacred things, and that the only difference is one of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> are not distinguished thereby.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it does not seem possible that things belonging to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> should at the same time differ specifically. Now <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, and unlawful intercourse, are different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore they cannot belong to the one same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>: and consequently it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> are distinguished in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and not according to the various sacred things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, among sacred things sacred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are reckoned. If, therefore, one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> arises from the violation of a sacred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, it would follow that every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed by a sacred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, since every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> violates the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the sinner. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> are not reckoned according to the sacred things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Acts and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are distinguished by their objects. Now the sacred thing is the object of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> are distinguished according to the sacred things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> consists in the irreverent treatment of a sacred thing. Now reverence is due to a sacred thing by reason of its <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>: and consequently the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> must needs be distinguished according to the different aspects of sanctity in the sacred things which are treated irreverently: for the greater the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> ascribed to the sacred thing that is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against, the more grievous the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is ascribed, not only to sacred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, namely, those who are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the divine worship, but also to sacred places and to certain other sacred things. And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of a place is directed to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who worships <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place. For it is written (<a href="../bible/2ma005.htm#verse19">2 Maccabees 5:19</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not choose the people for the place's sake, but the place for the people's sake." Hence <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> committed against a sacred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than that which is committed against a sacred place. Yet in either <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> there are various degrees of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, according to differences of sacred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and places.

<p>In like manner the third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, which is committed against other sacred things, has various degrees, according to the differences of sacred things. Among these the highest place belongs to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sanctified: chief of which is the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, for it contains <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> that is committed against this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is the gravest of all. The second place, after the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, belongs to the vessels <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; also sacred images, and the relics of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, wherein the very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, so to speak, are reverenced and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. After these come things connected with the apparel of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its ministers; and those things, whether movable or immovable, that are deputed to the upkeep of the ministers. And whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against any one of the aforesaid incurs the crime of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is not the same aspect of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in all the aforesaid: wherefore the diversity of sacred things is not only a material, but also a formal difference.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing hinders two things from belonging to one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in one respect, and to different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in another respect. Thus <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> belong to the one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, "animal," but differ in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> "colored thing," if one be white and the other black. On like manner it is possible for two <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to differ specifically as to their material acts, and to belong to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as regards the one formal aspect of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>: for instance, the violation of a nun by blows or by copulation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed by a sacred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> materially and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> as it were. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [The quotation is from <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, De Consideration, ii, 13 says that "a trifle on a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> lips is a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> or a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>." But formally and properly speaking a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed by a sacred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> only when it is committed against his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, for instance if a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be guilty of fornication: and the same is to be said of other instances.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the punishment of sacrilege should be pecuniary?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the punishment of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> should not be pecuniary. A pecuniary punishment is not wont to be inflicted for a criminal fault. But <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is a criminal fault, wherefore it is punished by capital sentence according to <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> [Dig. xlviii, 13; Cod. i, 3, de Episc. et Cleric.]. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> should not be awarded a pecuniary punishment.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should not receive a double punishment, according to <a href="../bible/nah001.htm#verse9">Nahum 1:9</a>, "There shall not rise a double affliction." But <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is punished with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>; major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, for violating a sacred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and for burning or destroying a church, and minor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> for other <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrileges</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> should not be awarded a pecuniary punishment.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse5">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>): "Neither have we taken an occasion of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>." But it seems to involve an occasion of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> that a pecuniary punishment should be exacted for the violation of a sacred thing. Therefore this does not seem to be a fitting punishment of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written [XVII, qu. iv, can. Si quis contumax]: "If anyone contumaciously or arrogantly take away by force an escaped <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> from the confines of a church he shall pay nine hundred soldi": and again further on (XVII, qu. iv, can. Quisquis inventus, can. 21): "Whoever is found guilty of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> shall pay thirty pounds of tried purest silver."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the award of punishments two points must be considered. First equality, in order that the punishment may be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and that "by what things a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a> by the same . . . he may be tormented" (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse17">Wisdom 11:17</a>). On this respect the fitting punishment of one guilty of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, since he has done an injury to a sacred thing, is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> [Append. Gratian. on can. Si quis contumax, quoted above] whereby sacred things are withheld from him. The second point to be considered is utility. For punishments are inflicted as medicines, that men being deterred thereby may desist from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it would seem that the sacrilegious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who reverences not sacred things, is not sufficiently deterred from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> by sacred things being withheld from him, since he has no care for them. Wherefore according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws he is sentenced to capital punishment, and according to the statutes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which does not inflict the death of the body, a pecuniary punishment is inflicted, in order that men may be deterred from <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, at least by temporal punishments.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Church inflicts not the death of the body, but <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> in its stead.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When one punishment is not sufficient to deter a man from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a double punishment must be inflicted. Wherefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to inflict some kind of temporal punishment in addition to the punishment of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, in order to coerce those who despise <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If money were exacted without a reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, this would seem to involve an occasion of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. But when it is exacted for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> correction, it has a manifest utility, and consequently involves no occasion of avarice.
