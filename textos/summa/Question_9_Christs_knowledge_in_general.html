<h1>Question 9. Christ's knowledge in general</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4009.htm#article1"> Did Christ have any knowledge besides the Divine?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4009.htm#article2"> Did He have the knowledge which the blessed or comprehensors have?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4009.htm#article3"> Did He have an imprinted or infused knowledge?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4009.htm#article4"> Did He have any acquired knowledge?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ had any knowledge besides the Divine?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> except the Divine. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that things may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> thereby. But by His <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">Divine knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> all things. Therefore any other <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> would have been superfluous in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the lesser light is dimmed by the greater. But all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in comparison with the uncreated <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is as the lesser to the greater light. Therefore there shone in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> no other <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> except the Divine.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the union of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the Divine took place in the Person, as is clear from 2, 2. Now, according to some there is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a certain "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the union," whereby <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> more fully than anyone else. Hence, since the personal union contains two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, it would seem that there are not two <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledges</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but one only, pertaining to both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Incarnat. vii): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> assumed the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the flesh; He took upon Himself the sense of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but not the swollen sense of the flesh." But <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> pertains to the sense of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As said above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed an entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, i.e. not only a body, but also a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and not only a sensitive, but also a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And therefore it behooved Him to have <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, for three reasons. First, on account of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> perfection. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, considered in itself, is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> intelligible things. since it is like "a tablet on which nothing is written," and yet it may be written upon through the possible <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whereby it may become all things, as is said De Anima iii, 18. Now what is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is imperfect unless reduced to act. But it was fitting that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> should assume, not an imperfect, but a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> was to be brought back to perfection by its means. Hence it behooved the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be perfected by a <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, which would be its proper perfection. And therefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that there should be another <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> besides the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">Divine knowledge</a>, otherwise the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would have been more imperfect than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Secondly, because, since everything is on account of its operation, as stated De Coel. ii, 17, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would have had an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to no purpose if He had not understood by it; and this pertains to <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Thirdly, because some <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, viz. that whereby we <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> first principles; since we are here taking <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> for any cognition of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now nothing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> was wanting to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since He took the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). And hence the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth Council</a> [Third Council of Constantinople, Act. 4] condemned the opinion of those who denied that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are two <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledges</a> or wisdoms.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all things with the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">Divine knowledge</a> by an uncreated operation which is the very Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> understanding is His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Metaph. xii, text. 39). Hence this act could not belong to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, seeing that it belongs to another <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore, if there had been no other <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it would have <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">known</a> nothing; and thus it would have been assumed to no purpose, since everything is on account of its operation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If the two lights are supposed to be in the same order, the lesser is dimmed by the greater, as the light of the sun dims the light of a candle, both being in the class of illuminants. But if we suppose two lights, one of which is in the class of illuminants and the other in the class of illuminated, the lesser light is not dimmed by the greater, but rather is strengthened, as the light of the air by the light of the sun. And in this manner the light of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> is not dimmed, but rather is heightened in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by the light of the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">Divine knowledge</a>, which is "the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light which enlighteneth every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that cometh into this world," as is written <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John 1:9</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> On the part of what are united we hold there is a <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, both as to His Divine and as to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; so that, by reason of the union whereby there is one hypostasis of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are attributed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the things of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was said above (3, 1, 6). But on the part of the union itself we cannot admit any <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For this union is in personal being, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> only by reason of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ had the knowledge which the blessed or comprehensors have?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was not the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of the blessed or comprehensors. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the blessed is a participation of Divine light, according to <a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse10">Psalm 35:10</a>: "In Thy light we shall see light." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not a participated light, but He had the Godhead Itself substantially abiding in Him, according to <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse9">Colossians 2:9</a>: "For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead corporeally." Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was not the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of the blessed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the blessed makes them blessed, according to <a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a>: "This is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>: that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Thee, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Whom Thou hast sent." But this Man was blessed through being united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa064.htm#verse5">Psalm 64:5</a>: "Blessed is He Whom Thou hast chosen and taken to Thee." Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to suppose the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of the blessed in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> belongs a double <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>--one by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, one above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the blessed, which consists in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but above his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was another and much higher <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">Divine knowledge</a>. Therefore there was no need of the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of the blessed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the blessed consists in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> fully, even as He was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse55">John 8:55</a>: "I do <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> Him, and do keep His word." Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of the blessed.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> What is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is reduced to act by what is in act; for that whereby things are heated must itself be hot. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the blessed, which consists in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>; and is ordained to it as to an end; since the rational creature is capable of that blessed <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, inasmuch as he is made in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are brought to this end of beatitude by the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse10">Hebrews 2:10</a>: "For it became Him, for Whom are all things, and by Whom are all things, Who had brought many children unto <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to perfect the author of their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>." And hence it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific knowledge</a>, which consists in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, should belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> pre-eminently, since the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> ought always to be more efficacious than the effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Godhead is united to the manhood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in Person, not in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; yet with the unity of Person remains the distinction of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. And therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, through a light participated from the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, is perfected with the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific knowledge</a> whereby it sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By the union this Man is blessed with the uncreated beatitude, even as by the union He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; yet besides the uncreated beatitude it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that there should be in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> beatitude, whereby His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was established in the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision and knowledge</a> are to some extent above the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, inasmuch as it cannot reach it of its own strength; but in another way it is in accordance with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, inasmuch as it is capable of it by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, having been made to the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above. But the uncreated <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is in every way above the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ had an imprinted or infused knowledge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> another infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> besides the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific knowledge</a>. For all other <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> compared to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific knowledge</a> is like imperfect to perfect. But imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is removed by the presence of perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as the clear "face-to-face" vision removes the enigmatical vision of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as is plain from <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 13:10-12</a>. Since, therefore, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific knowledge</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), it would seem that there could not be any other imprinted <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an imperfect mode of cognition disposes towards a more perfect, as opinion, the result of dialectical syllogisms, disposes towards science, which results from demonstrative syllogisms. Now, when perfection is reached, there is no further need of the disposition, even as on reaching the end motion is no longer <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Hence, since every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> cognition is compared to beatific cognition, as imperfect to perfect and as disposition to its term, it seems that since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific knowledge</a>, it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Him to have any other <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to sensible forms, so the possible <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to intelligible forms. Now corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> cannot receive two forms at once! one more perfect and the other less perfect. Therefore neither can the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receive a double <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> at once, one more perfect and the other less perfect; and hence the same conclusion as above.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse3">Colossians 2:3</a>) that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "are hid all the treasures of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it was fitting that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> should not be imperfect. Now everything in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is imperfect unless it be reduced to act. But the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to all intelligible things. and it is reduced to act by intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which are its completive forms, as is plain from what is said De Anima iii, 32,38. And hence we must admit in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> an infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> imprinted upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is personally united to Him, intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of all things to which the possible <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; even as in the beginning of the creation of things, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> imprinted intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8). And therefore, even as in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. iv, 22,24,30), there is a double <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>--one the morning <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things in the Word; the other the evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things in their proper natures by infused <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; so likewise, besides the Divine and uncreated <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, there is in His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific knowledge</a>, whereby He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Word, and things in the Word; and an infused or imprinted <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> things in their proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> proportioned to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The imperfect vision of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> opposed to manifest vision, seeing that it is of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to have reference to the unseen, as was said above (II-II, 1, 4). But cognition by infused <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> includes no opposition to beatific cognition. Therefore there is no parity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Disposition is referred to perfection in two ways: first, as a way leading to perfection; secondly, as an effect proceeding from perfection; thus <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is disposed by heat to receive the form of fire, and, when this comes, the heat does not cease, but remains as an effect of this form. So, too, opinion <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a dialectical syllogism is a way to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is acquired by demonstration, yet, when this has been acquired, there may still remain the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> gained by the dialectical syllogism, following, so to say, the demonstrative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is based on the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, since he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is thereby enabled the better to understand the probable signs from which dialectical syllogisms proceed. So likewise in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific knowledge</a>, there still remains infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, not as a way to beatitude, but as strengthened by beatitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific knowledge</a> is not by a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, that is a similitude of the Divine Essence, or of whatever is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the Divine Essence, as is plain from what has been said in I, 12, 2; but it is a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Divine Essence immediately, inasmuch as the Divine Essence itself is united to the beatified mind as an intelligible to an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> being; and the Divine Essence is a form exceeding the capacity of any creature whatsoever. Hence, together with this super-exceeding form, there is nothing to hinder from being in the rational mind, intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, proportioned to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ had any acquired knowledge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no empiric and acquired <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>. For whatever befitted <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, He had most perfectly. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not possess acquired <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> most perfectly, since He did not devote Himself to the study of letters, by which <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> is acquired in its perfection; for it is said (<a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse15">John 7:15</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> wondered, saying: How doth this Man <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> letters, having never learned?" Therefore it seems that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no acquired <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing can be added to what is full. But the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was filled with intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> divinely infused, as was said above (A. 3). Therefore no acquired <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> could accrue to His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, he who already has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, acquires no new <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, through what he receives from the senses (otherwise two forms of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> would be in the same thing together); but the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which previously <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> is strengthened and increased. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, it does not seem that He acquired a new <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> through what He perceived by the senses.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse8">Hebrews 5:8</a>): "Whereas . . . He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, He learned obedience by the things which He suffered," i.e. "experienced," says a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>. Therefore there was in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> an empiric <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is acquired <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is plain from 1, nothing that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> planted in our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was wanting to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. Now it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> planted in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> not only a passive, but an active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was not merely a passive, but also an active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But if in other things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> make nothing in vain, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Coel. i, 31; ii, 59), still less in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is there anything in vain. Now what has not its proper operation is useless, as is said in De Coel. ii, 17. Now the proper operation of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is to make intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in act, by abstracting them from phantasms; hence, it is said (De Anima iii, 18) that the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is that "whereby everything is made actual." And thus it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there were intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> received in the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by the action of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>--which means that there was acquired <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in Him, which some call empiric. And hence, although I wrote differently (Sent. iii, D, xiv, 3; D, xviii, 3), it must be said that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was acquired <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is properly <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fashion, both as regards the subject receiving and as regards the active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For such <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> springs from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, on account of a light infused from on high, and this manner of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing</a> is proportioned to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific knowledge</a>, whereby the very Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen, is proper and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, as was said in the I, 12, 4.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since there is a twofold way of acquiring <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>--by discovery and by being taught--the way of discovery is the higher, and the way of being taught is secondary. Hence it is said (Ethic. i, 4): "He indeed is the best who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> everything by himself: yet he is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> who obeys him that speaks aright." And hence it was more fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to possess a <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> acquired by discovery than by being taught, especially since He was given to be the Teacher of all, according to <a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse23">Joel 2:23</a>: "Be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyful</a> in the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He hath given you a Teacher of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind has two relations--one to higher things, and in this respect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was full of the infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>. The other relation is to lower things, i.e. to phantasms, which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> move the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind by virtue of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that even in this respect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be filled with <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, not that the first fulness was insufficient for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind in itself, but that it behooved it to be also perfected with regard to phantasms.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Acquired and infused <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not to be classed together; for the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is acquired by the relation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind to phantasms; hence, another <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of the same kind cannot be again acquired. But the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of infused <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is of a different <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as coming down to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from on high, and not from phantasms. And hence there is no parity between these <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.
