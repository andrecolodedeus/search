<h1>Question 9. That which moves the will</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the will is moved by the intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not moved by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse20">Psalm 118:20</a>: "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hath <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> to long for Thy justifications: The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> flies ahead, the desire follows sluggishly or not at all: we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> delight us not." But it would not be so, if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> were moved by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: because movement of the movable results from motion of the mover. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in presenting the appetible object to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, stands in relation to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> in representing the appetible will to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, does not remove the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: indeed sometimes our <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> affects us no more than what is set before us in a picture, and moves us not at all (De Anima ii, 3). Therefore neither does the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same is not mover and moved in respect of the same thing. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; for we exercise the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> when we will. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 10) that "the appetible object is a mover not moved, whereas the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a mover moved."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing requires to be moved by something in so far as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to several things; for that which is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> needs to be reduced to act by something actual; and to do this is to move. Now a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is seen to be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to different things in two ways: first, with regard to acting and not acting; secondly, with regard to this or that action. Thus the sight sometimes sees actually, and sometimes sees not: and sometimes it sees white, and sometimes black. It needs therefore a mover in two respects, viz. as to the exercise or use of the act, and as to the determination of the act. The first of these is on the part of the subject, which is sometimes acting, sometimes not acting: while the other is on the part of the object, by reason of which the act is specified.

<p>The motion of the subject itself is due to some agent. And since every agent acts for an end, as was shown above (Question 1, Article 2), the principle of this motion lies in the end. And hence it is that the art which is concerned with the end, by its command moves the art which is concerned with the means; just as the "art of sailing commands the art of shipbuilding" (Phys. ii, 2). Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in general, which has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an end, is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Consequently, in this respect, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to their acts, for we make use of the other powers when we will. For the end and perfection of every other power, is included under the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and always the art or power to which the universal end belongs, moves to their acts the arts or powers to which belong the particular ends included in the universal end. Thus the leader of an army, who intends the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--i.e. the order of the whole army--by his command moves one of the captains, who intends the order of one company.

<p>On the other hand, the object moves, by determining the act, after the manner of a formal principle, whereby in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things actions are specified, as heating by heat. Now the first formal principle is universal "being" and "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," which is the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And therefore by this kind of motion the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as presenting its object to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passage quoted proves, not that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not move, but that it does not move of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of a form without estimation of fitness or harmfulness, does not move the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; so neither does the apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> without the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and desirability. Hence it is not the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> that moves, but the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (De Anima iii, 9).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The will moves the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as to the exercise of its act; since even the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> itself which is the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, is included in the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as a particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But as to the determination of the act, which the act derives from the object, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> itself is apprehended under a special aspect as contained in the universal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. It is therefore evident that the same is not mover and moved in the same respect.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the will is moved by the sensitive appetite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be moved by the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. For "to move and to act is more excellent than to be passive," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16). But the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is less excellent than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; just as sense is less excellent than <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> does not move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no particular power can produce a universal effect. But the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a particular power, because it follows the particular apprehension of sense. Therefore it cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which movement is universal, as following the universal apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. viii, 5, the mover is not moved by that which it moves, in such a way that there be reciprocal motion. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, inasmuch as the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> obeys the reason. Therefore the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> does not move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse14">James 1:14</a>): "Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is tempted by his own <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, being drawn away and allured." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not be drawn away by his <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, unless his will were moved by the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, wherein <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> resides. Therefore the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), that which is apprehended as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and fitting, moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> by way of object. Now, that a thing appear to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and fitting, happens from two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: namely, from the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, either of the thing proposed, or of the one to whom it is proposed. For fitness is spoken of by way of relation; hence it depends on both extremes. And hence it is that taste, according as it is variously disposed, takes to a thing in various ways, as being fitting or unfitting. Wherefore as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 5): "According as a man is, such does the end seem to him."

<p>Now it is evident that according to a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is changed to a certain disposition. Wherefore according as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is affected by a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, something seems to him fitting, which does not seem so when he is not so affected: thus that seems <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to a man when angered, which does not seem <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> when he is calm. And in this way, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, on the part of the object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Nothing hinders that which is better simply and in itself, from being less excellent in a certain respect. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is simply more excellent than the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: but in respect of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in whom a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> is predominant, in so far as he is subject to that passion, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is more excellent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Men's acts and choices are in reference to singulars. Wherefore from the very fact that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a particular power, it has great influence in disposing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> so that something seems to him such or otherwise, in particular cases.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 2), the reason, in which resides the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, moves, by its command, the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers, not, indeed, "by a despotic sovereignty," as a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is moved by his master, but by a "royal and politic sovereignty," as free men are ruled by their governor, and can nevertheless act counter to his commands. Hence both irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> can move counter to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: and accordingly nothing hinders the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> from being moved by them at times.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the will moves itself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not move itself. For every mover, as such, is in act: whereas what is moved, is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; since "movement is the act of that which is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, as such" [<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Phys. iii, 1. Now the same is not in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and in act, in respect of the same. Therefore nothing moves itself. Neither, therefore, can the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> move itself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the movable is moved on the mover being present. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is always present to itself. If, therefore, it moved itself, it would always be moving itself, which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> move itself, it would follow that the same thing is at once moved immediately by two movers; which seems unreasonable. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not move itself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is mistress of its own act, and to it belongs to will and not to will. But this would not be so, had it not the power to move itself to will. Therefore it moves itself.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to move the other powers, by reason of the end which is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> object. Now, as stated above (Question 8, Article 2), the end is in things appetible, what the principle is in things intelligible. But it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, through its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the principle, reduces itself from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, as to its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the conclusions; and thus it moves itself. And, in like manner, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, through its volition of the end, moves itself to will the means.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not in respect of the same that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves itself and is moved: wherefore neither is it in act and in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in respect of the same. But forasmuch as it actually wills the end, it reduces itself from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, in respect of the means, so as, in a word, to will them actually.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is always actually present to itself; but the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whereby it wills an end, is not always in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But it is by this act that it moves itself. Accordingly it does not follow that it is always moving itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, otherwise than by itself. By the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> it is moved on the part of the object: whereas it is moved by itself, as to the exercise of its act, in respect of the end.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the will is moved by an exterior principle?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not moved by anything exterior. For the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. But it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act that it be from an intrinsic principle, just as it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> act. Therefore the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not from anything exterior.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot suffer <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, as was shown above (Question 6, Article 4). But the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> act is one "the principle of which is outside the agent" [<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Ethic. iii, 1. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be moved by anything exterior.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is sufficiently moved by one mover, needs not to be moved by another. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves itself sufficiently. Therefore it is not moved by anything exterior.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by the object, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be something exterior, offered to the sense. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be moved by something exterior.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As far as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by the object, it is evident that it can be moved by something exterior. But in so far as it is moved in the exercise of its act, we must again hold it to be moved by some exterior principle.

<p>For everything that is at one time an agent actually, and at another time an agent in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, needs to be moved by a mover. Now it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> begins to will something, whereas previously it did not will it. Therefore it must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, be moved by something to will it. And, indeed, it moves itself, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), in so far as through willing the end it reduces itself to the act of willing the means. Now it cannot do this without the aid of counsel: for when a man wills to be healed, he begins to reflect how this can be attained, and through this reflection he comes to the conclusion that he can be healed by a physician: and this he wills. But since he did not always actually will to have health, he must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, have begun, through something moving him, to will to be healed. And if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moved itself to will this, it must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, have done this with the aid of counsel following some previous volition. But this process could not go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Wherefore we must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, suppose that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> advanced to its first movement in virtue of the instigation of some exterior mover, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> concludes in a chapter of the Eudemian Ethics (vii, 14).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act that its principle be within the agent: but it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that this inward principle be the first principle unmoved by another. Wherefore though the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act has an inward proximate principle, nevertheless its first principle is from without. Thus, too, the first principle of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement is from without, that, to wit, which moves <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> For an act to be <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> it is not enough that its principle be extrinsic, but we must add "without the concurrence of him that suffers <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>." This does not happen when the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by an exterior principle: for it is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that wills, though moved by another. But this movement would be <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>, if it were counter to the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: which in the present case is impossible; since then the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> would will and not will the same thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The will moves itself sufficiently in one respect, and in its own order, that is to say as proximate agent; but it cannot move itself in every respect, as we have shown. Wherefore it needs to be moved by another as first mover.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the will is moved by a heavenly body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by a heavenly body. For all various and multiform movements are reduced, as to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, to a uniform movement which is that of the heavens, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. viii, 9. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> movements are various and multiform, since they begin to be, whereas previously they were not. Therefore they are reduced, as to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, to the movement of the heavens, which is uniform according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. iii, 4) "the lower bodies are moved by the higher." But the movements of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, which are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, could not be reduced to the movement of the heavens, as to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, unless the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> too were moved by the heavens. Therefore the heavens move the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by observing the heavenly bodies astrologers foretell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about future <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, which are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But this would not be so, if the heavenly bodies could not move <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by a heavenly body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 7) that "the heavenly bodies are not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of our acts." But they would be, if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, were moved by the heavenly bodies. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not moved by the heavenly bodies.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is evident that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be moved by the heavenly bodies in the same way as it is moved by its object; that is to say, in so far as exterior bodies, which move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, through being offered to the senses, and also the organs themselves of the sensitive powers, are subject to the movements of the heavenly bodies.

<p>But some have maintained that heavenly bodies have an influence on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, in the same way as some exterior agent moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as to the exercise of its act. But this is impossible. For the "will," as stated in De Anima iii, 9, "is in the reason." Now the reason is a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not bound to a bodily organ: wherefore it follows that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a power absolutely incorporeal and immaterial. But it is evident that no body can act on what is incorporeal, but rather the reverse: because things incorporeal and immaterial have a power more formal and more universal than any corporeal things whatever. Therefore it is impossible for a heavenly body to act directly on the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or will. For this reason <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Anima iii, 3) ascribed to those who held that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> differs not from sense, the theory that "such is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as is the day which the father of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of gods bring on" [Odyssey xviii. 135 (referring to Jupiter, by whom they understand the entire heavens). For all the sensitive powers, since they are acts of bodily organs, can be moved <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, by the heavenly bodies, i.e. through those bodies being moved, whose acts they are.

<p>But since it has been stated (2) that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is moved, in a fashion, by the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, the movements of the heavenly bodies have an indirect bearing on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; in so far as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> happens to be moved by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The multiform movements of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will are reduced to some uniform <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which, however, is above the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will. This can be said, not of any body, but of some superior immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore there is no need for the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to be referred to the movement of the heavens, as to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The movements of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body are reduced, as to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, to the movement of a heavenly body, in so far as the disposition suitable to a particular movement, is somewhat due to the influence of heavenly bodies; also, in so far as the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is stirred by the influence of heavenly bodies; and again, in so far as exterior bodies are moved in accordance with the movement of heavenly bodies, at whose presence, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> begins to will or not to will something; for instance, when the body is chilled, we begin to wish to make the fire. But this movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is on the part of the object offered from without: not on the part of an inward instigation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Cf. I, 84, 6,7) the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is the act of a bodily organ. Wherefore there is no reason why <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not be prone to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, or some like passion, by reason of the influence of heavenly bodies, just as by reason of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> complexion. But the majority of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are led by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, which the wise alone resist. Consequently, in the majority of cases predictions about <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, gathered from the observation of heavenly bodies, are fulfilled. Nevertheless, as Ptolemy says (Centiloquium v), "the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> governs the stars"; which is a though to say that by resisting his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, he opposes his will, which is free and nowise subject to the movement of the heavens, to such like effects of the heavenly bodies.

<p>Or, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 15): "We must confess that when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is foretold by astrologers, this is due to some most hidden inspiration, to which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is subject without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it. And since this is done in order to deceive <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it must be the work of the lying spirits."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the will is moved by God alone, as exterior principle?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone as exterior principle. For it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> that the inferior be moved by its superior: thus the lower bodies are moved by the heavenly bodies. But there is something which is higher than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and below <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will can be moved by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> also, as exterior principle.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> follows the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is reduced to act, not by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, but also by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who enlightens it, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv). For the same reason, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> also is moved by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of other than <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, according to <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis 1:31</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw all the things that He had made, and they were very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." If, therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will were moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, it would never be moved to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and yet it is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> whereby "we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and whereby we do right," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 9).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse13">Philippians 2:13</a>): "It is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who worketh in us" [Vulg.'you'] "both to will and to accomplish."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is from within, as also is the movement of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now although it is possible for something to move a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing, without being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the thing moved, yet that alone, which is in some way the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a thing's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement in that thing. For a stone is moved upwards by a man, who is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the stone's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but this movement is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the stone; but the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement of the stone is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by no other than the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore it is said in Phys. vii, 4, that the generator moves locally heavy and light things. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> endowed with a <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is sometimes moved by something that is not his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; but that his <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> movement be from an exterior principle that is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his will, is impossible.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be none other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this is evident for two reasons. First, because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a power of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, by creation, as was stated in the I, 90, 2. Secondly, it is evident from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is ordained to the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore nothing else can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, Who is the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: while every other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by participation, and is some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and a particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> does not give a universal inclination. Hence neither can primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to all forms, be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by some particular agent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in such a way as to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his will, as the heavenly bodies are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forms, from which result the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movements of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is moved by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, on the part of the object, which by the power of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> light is proposed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And in this way the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> also can be moved by a creature from without, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will, as the Universal Mover, to the universal object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And without this universal motion, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot will anything. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> determines himself by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> to will this or that, which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Nevertheless, sometimes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves some specially to the willing of something determinate, which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; as in the case of those whom He moves by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as we shall state later on (109, 2).
