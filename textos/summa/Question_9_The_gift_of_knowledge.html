<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether knowledge is a gift?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> surpass the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> faculty. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> implies an effect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Poster. i, 2) that a "demonstration is a syllogism which produces <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are common to all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as stated above (8, 4; I-II, 68, 5). Now <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 1) that "many of the faithful lack <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> though they have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are more perfect than the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (I-II, 68, 8). Therefore one <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> suffices for the perfection of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding responds to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as stated above (Question 8, Article 2). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not respond to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, nor does it appear to which other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it can respond. Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are perfections of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (I-II, 68, 1,2), it seems that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> is reckoned among the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> is more perfect than <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and, therefore, does not fail in those things wherein <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be perfected by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now, when a man, by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, assents by his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he is perfected in two ways in respect of that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: first, because he grasps it; secondly, because he forms a sure judgment on it.

<p>Accordingly, two things are requisite in order that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> may perfectly assent to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: one of these is that he should have a sound grasp of the things that are proposed to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and this pertains to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding, as stated above (Question 8, Article 6): while the other is that he should have a sure and right judgment on them, so as to discern what is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, from what is not to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and for this the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is required.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Certitude of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> varies in various <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, according to the various <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of each <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> forms a sure judgment about a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the discursive process of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: and so <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is acquired by means of demonstrative reasoning. On the other hand, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is a sure judgment of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, without any discursive process, by simple intuition, as was stated in I, 14, 7; wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not discursive, or argumentative, but absolute and simple, to which that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is likened which is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, since it is a participated likeness thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A twofold <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> may be had about matters of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. One is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what one ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> by discerning things to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> from things not to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: in this way <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> and is common to all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The other is a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about matters of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, whereby one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not only what one ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but also how to make the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, how to induce others to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and confute those who deny the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is numbered among the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, which are not given to all, but to some. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, after the words quoted, adds: "It is one thing for a man merely to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and another to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to dispense what he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> to the godly, and to defend it against the ungodly."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are more perfect than the moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; but they are not more perfect than the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; rather are all the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> ordained to the perfection of the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as to their end. Hence it is not unreasonable if several <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are ordained to one theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the gift of knowledge is about Divine things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is about Divine things. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 1) that "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> begets, nourishes and strengthens <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is about Divine things, because its object is the First Truth, as stated above (Question 1, Article 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> also is about Divine things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is more excellent than acquired <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But there is an acquired <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about Divine things, for instance, the science of <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>. Much more therefore is the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about Divine things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>, "the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made." If therefore there is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, it seems that there is also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 1): "The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things may be properly called wisdom, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs may properly receive the name of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A sure judgment about a thing formed chiefly from its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and so the order of judgments should be according to the order of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. For just as the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the second, so ought the judgment about the second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be formed through the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: nor is it possible to judge of the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> through any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; wherefore the judgment which is formed through the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is the first and most perfect judgment.

<p>Now in those things where we find something most perfect, the common name of the genus is appropriated for those things which fall short of the most perfect, and some special name is adapted to the most perfect thing, as is the case in Logic. For in the genus of convertible terms, that which signifies "what a thing is," is given the special name of "definition," but the convertible terms which fall short of this, retain the common name, and are called "proper" terms.

<p>Accordingly, since the word <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> implies <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of judgment as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), if this <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of the judgment is derived from the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has a special name, which is wisdom: for a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in any branch of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and is able to judge of all matters by that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: and a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "absolutely," is one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which is absolutely highest, namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things is called "wisdom," while the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things is called "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," this being the common name denoting <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of judgment, and appropriated to the judgment which is formed through second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Accordingly, if we take <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in this way, it is a distinct <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom, so that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is only about <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> or <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are Divine and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself is something temporal in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the believer. Hence to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what one ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in themselves the very things we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, by a kind of union with them, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom corresponds more to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which unites <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument takes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the generic acceptation of the term: it is not thus that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, but according as it is restricted to judgments formed through <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 1, Article 1), every cognitive <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> regards formally the mean through which things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and materially, the things that are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through the mean. And since that which is formal, is of most account, it follows that those <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> which draw conclusions about physical <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from mathematical principles, are reckoned rather among the mathematical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, though, as to their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> they have more in common with physical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>: and for this reason it is stated in Phys. ii, 2 that they are more akin to physics. Accordingly, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His creatures, this seems to pertain to "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," to which it belongs formally, rather than to "wisdom," to which it belongs materially: and, conversely, when we judge of creatures according to Divine things, this pertains to "wisdom" rather than to "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the gift of knowledge is practical knowledge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is numbered among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, is practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 14) that "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is concerned with the actions in which we make use of external things." But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is concerned about actions is practical. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is practical.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. i, 32): "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> is nought if it hath not its use for piety . . . and piety is very useless if it lacks the discernment of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Now it follows from this authority that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> directs piety. But this cannot apply to a speculative science. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not speculative but practical.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are only in the righteous, as stated above (Question 9, Article 5). But speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> can be also in the unrighteous, according to <a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse17">James 4:17</a>: "To him . . . who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and doth it not, to him it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not speculative but practical.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. i, 32): "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> on her own day prepares a feast, because she overcomes the fast of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is not entirely removed, save by both kinds of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, viz. speculative and practical. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is both speculative and practical.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 9, Article 8), the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding, is ordained to the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> consists primarily and principally in speculation, in as much as it is founded on the First Truth. But since the First Truth is also the last end for the sake of which our works are done, hence it is that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> extends to works, according to <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians 5:6</a>: "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> . . . worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>."

<p>The consequence is that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> also, primarily and principally indeed, regards speculation, in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what he ought to hold by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; yet, secondarily, it extends to works, since we are directed in our actions by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and of conclusions drawn therefrom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in so far as it extends to works; for action is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, yet not action solely, nor primarily: and in this way it directs piety.

<p>Hence the Reply to the Second Objection is clear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As we have already stated (8, 5) about the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding, not everyone who understands, has the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding, but only he that understands through a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: and so we must take note, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that they alone have the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, who judge aright about matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and action, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed on them, so as never to wander from the straight path of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. This is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, according to <a href="../bible/wis010.htm#verse10">Wisdom 10:10</a>: "She conducted the just . . . through the right ways . . . and gave him the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the third beatitude, "Blessed are they that mourn," etc. corresponds to the gift of knowledge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the third beatitude, "Blessed are they that mourn," does not correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For, even as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow and grief, so is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> brings <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to light rather than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since the latter is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: for "the straight line rules both itself and the crooked line" (De Anima i, 5). Therefore the aforesaid beatitude does not suitably correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, consideration of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is an act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now there is no sorrow in the consideration of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; rather is there <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, since it is written (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse16">Wisdom 8:16</a>): "Her conversation hath no bitterness, nor her company any tediousness, but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">gladness</a>." Therefore the aforesaid beatitude does not suitably correspond with the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> consists in speculation, before operation. Now, in so far as it consists in speculation, sorrow does not correspond to it, since "the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not concerned about things to be sought or avoided" (De Anima iii, 9). Therefore the aforesaid beatitude is not suitably reckoned to correspond with the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte iv): "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> befits the mourner, who has discovered that he has been mastered by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which he <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> as though it were <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Right judgment about creatures belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now it is through creatures that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is occasioned, according to <a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse11">Wisdom 14:11</a>: "Creatures . . . are turned to an abomination . . . and a snare to the feet of the unwise," of those, namely, who do not judge aright about creatures, since they deem the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to consist in them. Hence they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by placing their last end in them, and lose the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. It is by forming a right judgment of creatures that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes aware of the loss (of which they may be the occasion), which judgment he exercises through the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p>Hence the beatitude of sorrow is said to correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Created goods do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, except in so far as they are referred to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> peace and the resulting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> correspond directly to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom: but to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> there corresponds, in the first place, sorrow for past <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and, in consequence, consolation, since, by his right judgment, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> directs creatures to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For this reason sorrow is set forth in this beatitude, as the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, and the resulting consolation, as the reward; which is begun in this life, and is perfected in the life to come.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Man rejoices in the very consideration of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; yet he may sometimes grieve for the thing, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of which he considers: it is thus that sorrow is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> No beatitude corresponds to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in so far as it consists in speculation, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> beatitude consists, not in considering creatures, but in contemplating <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> beatitude does consist somewhat in the right use of creatures, and in well-ordered love of them: and this I say with regard to the beatitude of a wayfarer. Hence beatitude relating to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is not ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but to understanding and wisdom, which are about Divine things.
