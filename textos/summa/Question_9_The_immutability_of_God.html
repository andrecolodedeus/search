<h1>Question 9. The immutability of God</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1009.htm#article1"> Is God altogether immutable?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1009.htm#article2"> Does it belong to God alone to be immutable?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether God is altogether immutable?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not altogether immutable. For whatever moves itself is in some way mutable. But, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit viii, 20), "The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator Spirit</a> moves Himself neither by time, nor by place." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in some way mutable.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is said of Wisdom, that "it is more mobile than all things active [Vulgate 'mobilior']" (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse24">Wisdom 7:24</a>). But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is wisdom itself; therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is movable.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to approach and to recede signify movement. But these are said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, "Draw nigh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and He will draw nigh to you" (<a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse8">James 4:8</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is mutable.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written, "I am the Lord, and I change not" (<a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse6">Malachi 3:6</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> From what precedes, it is shown that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is altogether immutable.

<p>First, because it was shown above that there is some first being, whom we call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and that this first being must be <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>, without the admixture of any <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, for the reason that, absolutely, <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is posterior to act. Now everything which is in any way changed, is in some way in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Hence it is evident that it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be in any way changeable.

<p>Secondly, because everything which is moved, remains as it was in part, and passes away in part; as what is moved from whiteness to blackness, remains the same as to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; thus in everything which is moved, there is some kind of composition to be found. But it has been shown above (Question 3, Article 7) that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no composition, for He is altogether simple. Hence it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be moved.

<p>Thirdly, because everything which is moved acquires something by its movement, and attains to what it had not attained previously. But since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, comprehending in Himself all the plenitude of perfection of all being, He cannot acquire anything new, nor extend Himself to anything whereto He was not extended previously. Hence movement in no way belongs to Him. So, some of the ancients, constrained, as it were, by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, decided that the first principle was immovable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> there speaks in a similar way to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who said that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">first mover</a> moves Himself; calling every operation a movement, even as the acts of understanding, and willing, and loving, are called movements. Therefore because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands and loves Himself, in that respect they said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves Himself, not, however, as movement and change belong to a thing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, as we now speak of change and movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Wisdom is called mobile by way of similitude, according as it diffuses its likeness even to the outermost of things; for nothing can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> which does not proceed from the divine wisdom by way of some kind of imitation, as from the first effective and formal principle; as also works of art proceed from the wisdom of the artist. And so in the same way, inasmuch as the similitude of the divine wisdom proceeds in degrees from the highest things, which participate more fully of its likeness, to the lowest things which participate of it in a lesser degree, there is said to be a kind of procession and movement of the divine wisdom to things; as when we say that the sun proceeds to the earth, inasmuch as the ray of light touches the earth. In this way <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. i) expounds the matter, that every procession of the divine manifestation comes to us from the movement of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father of light</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These things are said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> metaphorically. For as the sun is said to enter a house, or to go out, according as its rays reach the house, so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to approach to us, or to recede from us, when we receive the influx of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, or decline from Him.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether to be immutable belongs to God alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that to be immutable does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. ii) that "<a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in everything which is moved." But, according to some, certain <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, have not <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore to be immutable does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, everything in motion moves to some end. What therefore has already attained its ultimate end, is not in motion. But some creatures have already attained to their ultimate end; as all the blessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore some creatures are immovable.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everything which is mutable is variable. But forms are invariable; for it is said (Sex Princip. i) that "form is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> consisting of the simple and invariable." Therefore it does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone to be immutable.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. Boni. i), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is immutable; and whatever things He has made, being from nothing, are mutable."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is altogether immutable; whereas every creature is in some way mutable. Be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> therefore that a mutable thing can be called so in two ways: by a power in itself; and by a power possessed by another. For all creatures before they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, were possible, not by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power, since no creature is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but by the divine power alone, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could produce them into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Thus, as the production of a thing into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so likewise it depends on His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that things should be preserved; for He does not preserve them otherwise than by ever giving them <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; hence if He took away His action from them, all things would be reduced to nothing, as appears from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. iv, 12). Therefore as it was in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator's</a> power to produce them before they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in themselves, so likewise it is in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator's</a> power when they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in themselves to bring them to nothing. In this way therefore, by the power of another--namely, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--they are mutable, inasmuch as they are producible from nothing by Him, and are by Him reducible from <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to non-existence.

<p>If, however, a thing is called mutable by a power in itself, thus also in some manner every creature is mutable. For every creature has a twofold power, active and passive; and I call that power passive which enables anything to attain its perfection either in being, or in attaining to its end. Now if the mutability of a thing be considered according to its power for being, in that way all creatures are not mutable, but those only in which what is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> in them is consistent with non-being. Hence, in the inferior bodies there is mutability both as regards <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being, inasmuch as their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> with privation of their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, and also as regards their <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> being, supposing the subject to coexist with privation of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; as, for example, this subject "man" can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> with "not-whiteness" and can therefore be changed from white to not-white. But supposing the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> to be such as to follow on the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> principles of the subject, then the privation of such an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> cannot coexist with the subject. Hence the subject cannot be changed as regards that kind of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; as, for example, snow cannot be made black. Now in the celestial bodies <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not consistent with privation of form, because the form perfects the whole <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; therefore these bodies are not mutable as to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being, but only as to locality, because the subject is consistent with privation of this or that place. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">incorporeal substances</a>, being subsistent forms which, although with respect to their own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> are as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">act</a>, are not consistent with the privation of this <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">act</a>; forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is consequent upon form, and nothing corrupts except it lose its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Hence in the form itself there is no power to non-existence; and so these kinds of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are immutable and invariable as regards their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are pure from generation and from every variation, as also are incorporeal and immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>." Still, there remains in them a twofold mutability: one as regards their <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to their end; and in that way there is in them a mutability according to choice from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide ii, 3,4); the other as regards place, inasmuch as by their finite power they attain to certain fresh places--which cannot be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who by His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> fills all places, as was shown above (Question 8, Article 2).

<p>Thus in every creature there is a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to change either as regards <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being as in the case of things corruptible; or as regards locality only, as in the case of the celestial bodies; or as regards the order to their end, and the application of their powers to divers objects, as in the case with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and universally all creatures generally are mutable by the power of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>, in Whose power is their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and non-existence. Hence since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in none of these ways mutable, it belongs to Him alone to be altogether immutable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection proceeds from mutability as regards <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> being; for <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> treated of such movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, besides their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowment of immutability of being, have also immutability of election by divine power; nevertheless there remains in them mutability as regards place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Forms are called invariable, forasmuch as they cannot be subjects of variation; but they are subject to variation because by them their subject is variable. Hence it is clear that they vary in so far as they are; for they are not called beings as though they were the subject of being, but because through them something has being.
