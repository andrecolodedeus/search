<h1>Question 9. The quality of confession</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5009.htm#article1"> Can confession be lacking in form?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5009.htm#article2"> Should confession be entire?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5009.htm#article3"> Can one confess through another, or by writing?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5009.htm#article4"> Are the sixteen conditions, which are assigned by the masters, necessary for confession?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether confession can be lacking in form?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that confession cannot be lacking in <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/sir017.htm#verse26">Sirach 17:26</a>): "Praise [confession] perisheth from the dead as nothing." But a man without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is dead, because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore there can be no confession without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, confession is condivided with <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> and satisfaction. But <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> and satisfaction are impossible without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore confession is also impossible without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in confession that the word should agree with the thought for the very name of confession requires this. Now if a man confess while remaining attached to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, his word is not in accord with his thought, since in his heart he holds to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, while he condemns it with his lips. Therefore such a man does not confess.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to confess his mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now if a man in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has confessed once, he is not bound to confess the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> again, because, as no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> himself to have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of him that he had confessed. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that confession should be quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Confession is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and is part of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. In so far as it is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it has the property of being <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, and thus is of no avail without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. But in so far as it is part of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it subordinates the penitent to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who has the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and who by means of the confession <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> confessing. In this way it is possible for confession to be in one who is not <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a>, for he can make his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and subject himself to the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: and though he does not receive the fruit of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> then, yet he will begin to receive it, when he is sincerely <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a>, as happens in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: wherefore he is not bound to repeat his confession, but to confess his lack of sincerity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words must be understood as referring to the receiving of the fruit of confession, which none can receive who is not in the state of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Contrition and satisfaction are offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but confession is made to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: hence it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> and satisfaction, but not to confession, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who declares the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he has, speaks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and thus his thought agrees with his lips or words, as to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of confession, though it is discordant with the purpose of confession.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether confession should be entire?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for confession to be entire, namely, for a man to confess all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. For shame conduces to the diminution of punishment. Now the greater the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to whom a man confesses, the greater his shame. Therefore confession is more fruitful if it be divided among several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, confession is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in Penance in order that punishment may be enjoined for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> according to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Now a sufficient punishment for different <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be imposed by different <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to confess all one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it may happen that a man after going to confession and performing his penance, remembers a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which escaped his <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> while confessing, and that his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to whom he confessed first is no longer available, so that he can only confess that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and thus he will confess different <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to different <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the sole reason for confessing one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is in order to receive <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. Now sometimes, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who hears a confession can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from some of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but not from all. Therefore in such a case at all events the confession need not be entire.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Hypocrisy is an obstacle to Penance. But it savors of hypocrisy to divide one's confession, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says [De vera et falsa Poenitentia, work of an unknown author]. Therefore confession should be entire. Further, confession is a part of Penance. But Penance should be entire. Therefore confession also should be entire.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In prescribing medicine for the body, the physician should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not only the disease for which he is prescribing, but also the general constitution of the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since one disease is aggravated by the addition of another, and a medicine which would be adapted to one disease, would be harmful to another. The same is to be said in regard to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for one is aggravated when another is added to it; and a remedy which would be suitable for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, might <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> an incentive to another, since sometimes a man is guilty of contrary <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastoral. iii, 3). Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for confession that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> confess all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that he calls to mind, and if he fails to do this, it is not a confession, but a pretense of confession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although a man's shame is multiplied when he makes a divided confession to different confessors, yet all his different shames together are not so great as that with which he confesses all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> together: because one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> considered by itself does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposition of the sinner, as when it is considered in conjunction with several others, for a man may fall into one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or weakness, but a number of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> proves the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the sinner, or his great corruption.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The punishment imposed by different <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> would not be sufficient, because each would only consider one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by itself, and not the gravity which it derives from being in conjunction with another. Moreover sometimes the punishment which would be given for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would foster another. Again the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in hearing a confession takes the place of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that confession should be made to him just as <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore as there would be no <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> unless one were <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which one calls to mind, so is there no confession unless one confess all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that one remembers committing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some say that when a man remembers a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he had previously forgotten, he ought to confess again the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he had confessed before, especially if he cannot go to the same <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to whom his previous confession was made, in order that the total <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But this does not seem <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> takes its <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> both from itself and from the conjunction of another; and as to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he confessed he had already manifested their <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> which they have of themselves, while as to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he had forgotten, in order that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> which it has under both the above heads, it is enough that the penitent declare it explicitly, and confess the others in general, saying that he had confessed many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in his previous confession, but had forgotten this particular one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may be unable to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> the penitent from all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, yet the latter is bound to confess all to him, that he may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the total <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of his guilt, and refer him to the superior with regard to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from which he cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> him.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether one may confess through another, or by writing?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one may confess through another, or by writing. For confession is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order that the penitent's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> may be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But a man can make his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, through another or by writing. Therefore it is enough to confess through another or by writing.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, some are not understood by their own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on account of a difference of language, and consequently cannot confess save through others. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the sacrament that one should confess by oneself, so that if anyone confesses through another in any way whatever, it suffices for his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the sacrament that a man should confess to his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as appears from what has been said (8, 5). Now sometimes a man's own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is absent, so that the penitent cannot speak to him with his own voice. But he could make his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him by writing. Therefore it seems that he ought to manifest his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to him by writing to him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is bound to confess his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> even as he is bound to confess his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be made "with the mouth," as appears from <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse10">Romans 10:10</a>: therefore confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should also.

<p>Further, who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by himself should, by himself, do penance. But confession is part of penance. Therefore the penitent should confess his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Confession is not only an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but also part of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now, though, in so far as it is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it matters not how it is done, even if it be easier to do it in one way than in another, yet, in so far as it is part of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it has a determinate act, just as the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> have a determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. And as in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, in order to signify the inward washing, we employ that element which is chiefly used in washing, so in the sacramental act which is intended for manifestation we generally make use of that act which is most commonly employed for the purpose of manifestation, viz. our own words; for other ways have been introduced as supplementary to this.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> it is not enough to wash with anything, but it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to wash with a determinate element, so neither does it suffice, in Penance, to manifest one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> anyhow, but they must be declared by a determinate act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is enough for one who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of a language, to confess by writing, or by signs, or by an interpreter, because a man is not bound to do more than he can: although a man is not able or <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, except with water, which is from an entirely external source and is applied to us by another: whereas the act of confession is from within and is performed by ourselves, so that when we cannot confess in one way, we must confess as we can.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the absence of one's own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, confession may be made even to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, so that there is no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to confess in writing, because the act of confession is more <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> than the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom confession is made.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the sixteen conditions usually assigned are necessary for confession?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> assigned by masters, and contained in the following lines, are not requisite for confession: <blockquote> Simple, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, pure, faithful,<br> Frequent, undisguised, discreet, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, shamefaced,<br> Entire, secret, tearful, not delayed,<br> Courageously accusing, ready to obey.<br> </blockquote> For fidelity, simplicity, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> by themselves, and therefore should not be reckoned as <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of confession.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing is "pure" when it is not mixed with anything else: and "simplicity," in like manner, removes composition and admixture. Therefore one or the other is superfluous.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one is bound to confess more than once a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he has committed but once. Therefore if a man does not commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> again, his penance need not be "frequent."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, confession is directed to satisfaction. But satisfaction is sometimes public. Therefore confession should not always be "secret."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, that which is not in our power is not required of us. But it is not in our power to shed "tears." Therefore it is not required of those who confess.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We have the authority of the masters who assigned the above.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some of the above <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to confession, and some are requisite for its well-being. Now those things which are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to confession belong to it either as to an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or as to part of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. If in the first way, it is either by reason of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in general, or by reason of the special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of which it is the act, or by reason of the act itself. Now there are four <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in general, as stated in Ethic. ii, 4. The first is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in respect of which confession is said to be "discreet," inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is required in every act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and this discretion consists in giving greater weight to greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The second <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is choice, because acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, and in this respect confession is said to be "<a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>." The third <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is that the act be done for a particular purpose, viz. the due end, and in this respect confession is said to be "pure," i.e. with a right <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. The fourth <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is that one should act immovably, and in this respect it is said that confession should be "courageous," viz. that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should not be forsaken through shame.

<p>Now confession is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance. First of all it takes its origin in the horror which one conceives for the shamefulness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and in this respect confession should be "full of shame," so as not to be a boastful account of one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, by reason of some worldly vanity accompanying it. Then it goes on to deplore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed, and in this respect it is said to be "tearful." Thirdly, it culminates in self-abjection, and in this respect it should be "<a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>," so that one confesses one's misery and weakness.

<p>By reason of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, viz. confession, this act is one of manifestation: which manifestation can be hindered by four things: first, by falsehood, and in this respect confession is said to be "faithful," i.e. <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Secondly, by the use of vague words, and against this confession is said to be "open," so as not to be wrapped up in vague words; thirdly, by "multiplicity" of words, in which respect it is said to be "simple" indicating that the penitent should relate only such matters as affect the gravity of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; fourthly none of those things should be suppressed which should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and in this respect confession should be "entire."

<p>In so far as confession is part of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> it is subject to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who is the minister of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Wherefore it should be an "accusation" on the part of the penitent, should manifest his "readiness to obey" the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, should be "secret" as regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the court wherein the hidden affairs of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> are tried.

<p>The well-being of confession requires that it should be "frequent"; and "not delayed," i.e. that the sinner should confess at once.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is nothing unreasonable in one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> being a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the act of another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, through this act being commanded by that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; or through the mean which belongs to one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> principally, belonging to other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> by participation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> "pure" excludes perversity of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, from which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is cleansed: but the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> "simple" excludes the introduction of unnecessary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for confession, but is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of its well-being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Confession should be made not publicly but privately, lest others be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>, and led to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through hearing the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> confessed. On the other hand, the penance enjoined in satisfaction does not give rise to <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, since like works of satisfaction are done sometimes for slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and sometimes for none at all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> We must understand this to refer to tears of the heart.
